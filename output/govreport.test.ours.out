On January 5, 2011, the House of Representatives adopted an amendment to House Rule XII to require that Members of the House state the constitutional basis for Congress's power to enact the proposed legislation when introducing a bill or joint resolution. (The amendment does not pertain to concurrent or simple resolutions.) The Constitutional Authority Statement (CAS) rule was subsequently adopted in the 113th, 114th, 115th, and 116th Congresses. As the CAS rule begins its ninth year, the requirement continues to be a topic of congressional debate and inquiry, as Members of Congress contemplate how to comply with the rule. This report aims to aid in understanding the CAS requirement. It begins by providing a broad overview of Congress's powers under the Constitution and Congress's role in interpreting this document. The report then specifically addresses House Rule XI, clause 7(c), discussing its key requirements and limits, the legal effect of a CAS, and the debate over the rule's value. It concludes by discussing trends with regard to the House's recent CAS practices and by providing considerations for congressional personnel drafting CASs. In addition, the report contains two tables: Table 1 identifies the constitutional provisions most commonly cited in CASs during the last six months of the 114th and 115th Congresss, and Table 2 lists suggested constitutional authorities for various types of legislation. In preparing various versions of this report, CRS conducted a similar study of CASs from the last two Congresses, first examining the 937 CASs submitted between July 1, 2016, and January 1, 2017, consisting of 13 joint resolutions and 924 bills, and second examining the 1,110 CASs examined from January 2, 2018, and July 1 to July 2, 2019. The most frequently cited constitutional provision was Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, which provides Congress with the power to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof." While this power is considerable, it is necessarily tied to spending legislation, and is not itself a grant of power to Congress. The Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of this power as "broad," in that the clause leaves to Congress a large discretion as to the means that may be employed in executing a given power. In so holding, the Court has described the clause as providing the "broad power to enacted laws that are 'convenient, or useful' or 'conducive' to" a more specific authority's "beneficial exercise." The Constitution imposes two central types of limitations on the powers of Congress. First, the concept of enumerated powers creates what is often referred to as an "internal limit" on Congress's constitutional powers—that is, the powers are restricted by and to the terms of their express grant. Second, the Constitution also imposes "external" constraints on congressional action, or affirmative prohibitions found elsewhere in the text or structure of the document. For instance, Article 1, Section 9, lists specific constraints on the power of the federal government. For example, the clause prohibits Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus in peacetime; passing bills of attainder or ex post facto laws; imposing taxes or duties on exports "from any state"; and granting titles of nobility. The Court has also held that Congress cannot indirectly commandeer state governments by imposing limits on monetary grants that go so far as to functionally coerce states. Finally, constraints based on individual rights serve to prohibit congressional interference with the rights that individuals retain under the First Amendment and, in particular, under the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. The First Amendment, for example, prohibits the Congress from enacting a law that abridges the freedom of speech.
Under the Constitution, the war powers are divided between Congress and the President. Among other relevant grants, Congress has the power to declare war and raise and support the armed forces (Article I, Section 8), while the President is Commander in Chief (Article II, Section 2). It is generally agreed that the Commander-in-Chief role gives the President power to utilize the Armed Forces to repel attacks against the United States, but there has long been controversy over whether he is constitutionally authorized to send forces into hostile situations abroad without a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. Congressional concern about presidential use of armed forces without congressional authorization intensified after the Korean conflict. During the Vietnam War, Congress searched for a way to assert authority to decide when the U.S. should become involved in a war or the armed Forces be utilized in circumstances that might lead to hostilities. On November 7, 1973, it passed the War Powers Resolution (P.L. 93-148) over the veto of President Nixon. The main purpose of the Resolution was to establish procedures for both branches to share in decisions that might get the United United States involved in war. The drafters sought to circumscribe the President's authority to use armed forces abroad in hostilities or potential hostilities without a Declaration of War or other authorization, yet provide enough flexibility to permit him to respond to attack or other emergencies. The record of the Warpowers Resolution since its enactment has been mixed, and after 40 years it remains controversial. Some Members of Congress believe the Resolution has on some occasions served as a restraint on the use of Armed Forces by Presidents, provided a mode of communication, and given Congress a vehicle for asserting its war powers. Others have sought to amend the Resolution because they believe it has failed to assure a congressional voice in committing U. S. troops to potential conflicts abroad. Others in Congress, along with executive branch officials, contend that the President needs more flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy and that the time limitation in the War powers Resolution is unconstitutional and impractical. Some have argued for its repeal. This report examines the provisions and actual experience in its use from its enactment in 1973 through March 2015, and proposed amendments to it. Appendix A lists instances which Presidents have reported to Congress under the War Power's Resolution, and Appendix B lists certain instances of the use by Presidents that were not reported. The report will be updated as events warrant. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33487, War Powers and War Powers-Like Issues in the 115th Congress, by [author name scrubbed].
The Social Security Act of 1935 established a federal old-age pension financed with employee-employer payroll taxes. Since then, Congress has amended the social security program for multiple purposes, including to expand coverage, change the minimum age for retirement benefits, provide an automatic cost-of-living adjustment to benefits, and address concerns about solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds. This report traces the major decisions affecting the social Security program, from the earliest enacting legislation through the most recent congressional session. It provides a summary of the provisions and voting records for each bill, focusing on amendments to Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI), the formal name for Social Security. P.L. 271—74th Congress, Enactment of theSocial Security Act, August 14, 1935. Title II of the act created a compulsory national old-Age benefits program, covering nearly all workers in commerce and industry and providing monthly pensions for insured workers aged 65 or older. A benefit weighted toward lower-paid workers was to be based on cumulative wages and to be payable beginning in 1942 to persons aged 65 and older who had paid Social Security taxes for at least five years. Under Title VIII of the Act, a payroll tax of 1%, each, on employees and employers, payable on earnings up to $3,000 each year, was to been imposed on covered jobs as of January 1, 1937, and was scheduled to rise in steps to 3% each by 1949. Besides old- age benefits, the act provided for a system of federal-state unemployment compensation funded with employer payroll taxes, and for grants to states to help fund assistance payments to certain categories of needy persons (i.e., the aged, the blind, and children under 16 who had been deprived of parental support), child welfare services, and maternal and child health services. When the act was debated in Congress, prominent Republicans in the House and Senate made attempts to delete the provisions creating the pension system. They said they preferred to rely solely on the assistance approach to help the aged. They argued that the payroll tax/insurance mechanism of the program might be unconstitutional and that it would impose a heavy tax burden on businesses that would retard economic development. Although some party members tried to remove the provisions, the majority of Republicans in both chambers nevertheless did vote for the final Social Security bill. During congressional debate, the vast majority of Democrats generally supported the proposed old- Age benefits program. On June 2, 1939, following public hearings on the proposed amendments and six weeks of executive sessions, the Committee on Ways and Means reported to the House H.R. 6635, embodying its recommendations for amendments to the Social security Act. The House rejected the Townsend plan, which would have provided a $200-a-month pension to everyone 60 years of age or older, financed by a 2% tax on "all financial" transactions (essentially a sales tax). The Lundeen bill, which contained the provisions of a bill sponsored by Representative Lundeen (Farmer-Labor-Labor), was rejected by a vote of 56 to 206 on June 1, 1939. The Senate did not consider the Townsend bill, and instead passed a bill in 1940 that would have expanded Social Security coverage to workers employed in college fraternities and sororities. President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on November 1, 1940. The Social Security Amendments of 1946, which included provisions to increase benefits for widows and widowers, raised the earnings test limit from $1,680 to $2,100, reduced the waiting period for disability benefits from six to five months, and extended Medicare protection to disabled recipients who had received benefits for two years or more. President Nixon had requested a number of other Social Security liberalizations in 1969, but those proposals were entangled with his controversial welfare reform plan. It was not until 1972, when the 1972 amendments became law as P. L. 92-603, that the requested Social Security recommendations became law. The 1972 amendments increased benefits for widow's and widower's widows, increased disability benefits for disabled recipients, and provided a special minimum benefit of up to$170 a month for those who had worked many years, but at low earnings. In addition, OASDHI tax rate-increases scheduled for the periods 1973-1977, 1978-1980, 1981-1985, 1986-1992, 1993-1997, 1998-2010, and 2011 and years thereafter, were further raised. H
The Federal Reserve's (the Fed's) responsibilities as the nation's central bank fall into four main categories: monetary policy, provision of emergency liquidity through the lender of last resort function, supervision of certain types of banks and other financial firms for safety and soundness, and provision of payment system services to financial firms and the government. Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Fed, but retains oversight responsibilities to ensure that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of "maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates." The Fed has defined stable prices as a longer-run goal of 2% inflation—the change in overall prices, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. By contrast, the Fed states that "it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision." Monetary policy can be used to stabilize business cycle fluctuations (alternating periods of economic expansions and recessions) in the short run, while it mainly affects inflation in the long run. In December 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis and the "Great Recession," the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%. This was the first time rates were ever lowered to what is referred to as the zero lower bound. The recession ended in 2009, but as the economic recovery consistently proved weaker than expected in the years that followed, theFed repeatedly pushed back its time frame for raising interest rates. As a result, the economic expansion was in its seventh year and the unemployment rate was already near the Fed's estimate of full employment when it began raising rates on December 16, 2015. This was a departure from past practice—in the previous two economic expansions the Fed had raised rates within three years of the preceding recession ending. The Fed raised rates once in 2016, three times in 2017, and four times in 2018, by 0. 25 percentage points each time. Although monetary policy is now less stimulative than it had been at thezero lower bound, it is still adding stimulus to the economy as long as the rate is below what economists call the "neutral rate" (or the long-run equilibrium rate). The Fed's monetary policy has been stimulative throughout the expansion, which could be viewed as having successfully delivered on its mandated goals. The unemployment rate has been below 5% since 2015 and is now lower than the rate believed to be consistent with full employment. Economic theory posits that lower unemployment will lead to higher inflation, but inflation has not proven responsive to lower unemployment in recent years. Economic growth has also picked up beginning in the second quarter of 2017, after being persistently low by historical standards throughout the Expansion. Contributing to the 2018 growth acceleration was a more expansionary fiscal policy (larger structural budget deficit) that added more stimulus in the shorter run. Two notable policy changes contributing to fiscal stimulus in 2018 were the 2017 tax cuts (P.L. 115-97) and the boost to discretionary spending in FY2018 and FY2019 agreed to in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, P.L., 115-123. Despite strong economic data (which is only available with a lag), the Fed announced in January 2019 that it would be "patient" before raising rates again in light of increased economic uncertainty and financial volatility. If the Fed waits too long to raise rates again, the economy could overheat, resulting in high inflation and posing risk to financial stability. Raising rates more quickly would also provide more "headroom" for the Fed to lower rates more aggressively during the next economic downturn.
The U.S. Constitution does not clearly specify how military bases should be managed. Article II, Section 2, appoints the President as the commander-in-chief, with the implied power to deploy, and redeploy, the armed forces as necessary for national defense. In common practice, this has included the authority to create and close military installations needed to accommodate and train personnel under the President's command. However, Article I, Section 8, charges Congress with the responsibility to raise armies, maintain a Navy, and regulate the militia. Through annual authorization and appropriation legislation, Congress legislates policy for managing DOD real property assets and funds the construction, maintenance, operation, and disposal of military infrastructure. Throughout most of American history, the President has exercised broad, relatively unchallenged authority for opening, closing, or realigning military installations. Prompted by large-scale closures of World War II era infrastructure during the 1960s and 1970s, Congress enacted legislation in 1977 that effectively limited the Executive branch's ability to close or realign major military bases. The new statute, later codified as 10 U. S.C. 2687, generally required DOD to conduct comprehensive and lengthy assessments of major basing decisions as part of a congressional report-and-wait process. These assessments could be challenged in court on environmental grounds or on questions related to their sufficiency, further lengthening delays. By 1988, ongoing negotiations between the Secretary of Defense and the House and Senate Armed Service Committees led to new legislation (P.L. 100-526) that authorized a limited number of base closures based on the oversight of an independent panel. Though later modified, the effort marked the beginning of the first Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, which was intended to insulate base closings from considerations such as favoritism or other political interference. Widely considered a success, the 1988 BRAC legislation was taken up again and modified in succeeding BRAC rounds; first in 1991, 1993, and 1995; and again in 2005. The modern BRAC process refers to a temporary authority that amends the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, hereinafter referred to as the Base Closures Act, and features a framework of elements that entrusts an independent commission with certifying closure and realignment recommendations made by the Secretary. In general, the process has required the Secretary to submit a list of military installations recommended for closure or realignment to an independent, bipartisan BRAC commission, which may accept, reject, or modify the list. Upon completing its review, the commission forwards its final findings and recommendations to the President, who then submits them to Congress. If the President does not submit the recommendations to Congress within the timeframe required under the Baseclosure Act, the BRAC Process is terminated. Upon receipt of the report, Congress has the opportunity to disapprove of the recommendations in toto through the enactment of a joint resolution. In the 115th Congress, Members in both chambers proposed legislation that would have authorized a new round of BRAC. Though no legislation for a full BRAC was enacted, a provision included the following year in the final FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (H.R. 5515, H.Rept. 115-232) authorized BRAC-like actions within the confines of a state based on a recommendation of the governor and support of local communities affected by the proposed actions. This report will be updated as events warrant.
During World War II and then again after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Congress found that the existence of thousands of small business concerns was being threatened by war-induced shortages of materials coupled with an inability to obtain defense contracts or financial assistance. Concerned that many small businesses might fail without government assistance, in 1953, Congress passed and President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law the Small Business Act (P.L. 83-163), which authorized the Small business Administration (SBA). The act specifies that it is the declared policy of Congress to promote the interests of small businesses to "preserve free competitive enterprise." Congress specified that one of the ways to preserve free competitive enterprises was to insure that small businesses received a "fair proportion" of federal contracts and subcontracts. Congress indicated that its intent in supporting small businesses was not to "favor small business at the expense of its larger competitors. Our only purpose in supporting the creation and effective operation of the SBA is to equalize the scales when necessary to guarantee the continued vigor of our competitive free enterprise system." More recently, a House committee report indicated that the primary rationale for small business contracting programs is the positive economic benefits they provide, as well as assisting small businesses overcome the complexities of the system. The economic benefits of these programs can be seen in two primary areas—market competition and local economic development. First, these programs "are designed to increase and diversify small contractors with the intent of expanding the federal supplier base. This leads to increased competition, which results in higher quality, greater product variety, and lower prices." Second, these contracting initiatives lower barriers to entry in a wide range of markets for small businesses. This provides greater market access for small firms' goods and services. From an economic perspective, such access is critical to generating positive macroeconomic benefits, including higher job creation, wage growth, and greater income distribution. Over the years, Congress has approved legislation to support small business in various ways. For example, Congress established federal government-wide procurement goals to encourage the awarding of contracts to small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The Small Business Goaling Report, which is released annually, is the most convenient measure available to compare the federal government's performance over time in meeting these goals. In recent years, the government has generally succeeded in meeting the goals of awarding 23% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards to small business generally, 5% to small disadvantaged businesses, and 3% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs). However, it has had difficulty in meeting its goals of 5% for small disadvantaged small businesses, 3% for women-owned and women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs), and 3.0% for SDVs. This report describes the various federal programs, requirements, procurement officers, and procurement offices involved in promoting federal contracting and subcontracting with small business. It also discusses the role of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), located in each federal agency, and examines the role and responsibilities of various federal procurement officers in promoting small business opportunities. The report concludes with a brief discussion of the strong bipartisan support for these programs. However, that does not mean that these programs face no opposition, or that issues have not been raised concerning the impact or operations of specific programs. Critics have questioned some of the programs' effectiveness, in terms of promoting both small businesses opportunities to win federal contracts, and a more diversified, robust economy.
The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, concluded that "the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future—but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur." Although a variety of efforts seeking to reduce GHG emissions are currently underway on the international and sub-national level, federal policymakers and stakeholders have different viewpoints over what to do, if anything, about future climate change and related impacts. Their views regarding climate change cover a wide range of perspectives. For example, some contend that climate change poses a "direct, existential threat" to human society and that nations must start making significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid "dire effects." To support this argument, proponents of climate change mitigation highlight the evidence and conclusions from recent reports that are generally considered authoritative, including: 1. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Global Warhead of 1.5°C, 2018; and 2. The United States Global Change Research Program, Fourth National climate assessment, Volume II: Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in theUnited States, 2018. On the other hand, some question whether there are sufficient risks of climate changes to merit a federal program requiring GHG emission reductions. In addition, others argue that a unilateral approach to climate change by the United states could disproportionately impact domestic industries while achieving minimal results in global climate changes. If Congress were to consider establishing a program to reduceGHG emissions, one option would be to apply a tax or fee on GHGs or the inputs that produce them. This type of approach is commonly called a carbon tax or an emissions fee. A carbon tax could apply either directly to GHGs emissions or to the materials—based on their carbon contents—that ultimately generate the emissions (i.e., "emissions inputs"). A carbon price on emissions or their emissions inputs—mainly fossil fuels—would increase the relative price of the more carbon-intensive energy sources, particularly coal. This result could spur innovation in less carbon- intensive technologies (e.g., renewable energy, nuclear power, carbon capture and sequestration [CCS]) and stimulate other behavior that may decrease emissions, such as efficiency improvements. The energy price increases could also have both economy-wide impacts and negative effects on specific industries and particular demographic groups. In the 115th Congress, Members introduced nine carbon tax proposals. The House passed a resolution in 2018 "expressing the sense of Congress that acarbon tax would be detrimental to the UnitedStates economy" (H.Con.Res. 119). An analogous resolution was not introduced in the Senate. If policymakers decide to establish a carbon price system, Congress would face several key design decisions, including the point of taxation—where to impose the tax and what to tax—the rate of taxation, and whether and/or how to address importedcarbon-intensive materials. Alternatively, Congress could direct one or more federal agencies to determine these design features through a rulemaking procedure. All of the carbon tax legislative proposals in recent Congresses have included some degree of design details in the statutory language. Policymakers would face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of the new carbon tax revenues. Some economic analyses indicate that certain distributions of tax revenue—depending on the level of the tax—would have a greater economic impact than the direct effects from the tax on emissions. Some models indicate that the economic impacts would be greatest in the early years of the program, while others indicate that lower-income households would likely face a disproportionate impact. In general, economic studies have found that the relative ranking of revenue recycling options to mitigate the economy- wide impacts is generally the opposite of the relative rankings for alleviating distributional impacts. The contrasting relative rankings highlight a central tradeoff policymakers would face when deciding how to allocate carbon tax revenue.
The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) is a n independent, executive branch agency that works to protect current, former, and prospective federal employees against inappropriate employment-related actions, in accordance with " merit system principles ," statutorily defined standards governing the performance and management of the federal workforce. The MSPB also aims to promote an effective federal workforce free of prohibited personnel practices. The Board mainly carries out its mission through adjudication of federal employee appeals of adverse actions. When the Board determines that a federal employee has been subject to an improper adverse action, it may order relief, including reins tatement, backpay, and attorney' s fees. It may also order federal agencies to comply with Board orders, conduct special studies of the civil service and other executive branch merit systems, and review Office of Personnel Management (OPM) rules and regulations to determine, for example, whether a federal agency has invalidly implemented the OPM requirements. Federal law specifies that the Board consists of three members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, as of March 2019, the Board lacks any sitting members. Board member Mark A. Robbins, who served most recently as the Board's Acting Chairman, ended his term on February 28, 2019. In 2018, President Trump nominated three individuals to serve as Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Board member. A confirmation hearing for these nominees was subsequently held, but the nominees were not confirmed by the Senate before the adjournment of the 115th Congress. The President resubmitted the nominations for consideration by the 116th Congress on January 16, 2019, and on February, 13, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs approved two of the nominees, but one nominee withdrew from consideration prior to the committee's vote. The committee's chairman has indicated that he will not advance the two nominees to the full Senate until the President nominates, and the committee supports, a third member. Although other Board employees, including administrative judges who issue initial decisions in cases, will continue their work, some Members of Congress and others have raised concerns about the extent to which these vacancies limit the agency's ability to perform its other functions. This report discusses the establishment of the Board and its structure, as well as the role of the Office of Special Counsel, an independent, prosecutorial agency that operates concurrently with the Board. The report then addresses the Boards authority to adjudicate matters within its jurisdiction and the scope of this jurisdiction, aswell as the availability of judicial review for the Board’s decisions. Finally, the report examines the effect of the lack of a quorum of Board members.
The federal government is the nation's largest employer, with over two million workers employed in the United States, U.S. Territories, and foreign countries. A majority of these employees work in the competitive service of the executive branch. Applicants for competitive service positions compete with other applicants and are evaluated according to objective standards. The executive branch includes two other service classifications—the excepted service and the Senior Executive Service (SES)—with hiring and removal standards that diverge from those prescribed for thecompetitive service. The competitive service also includes non-executive branch positions and positions in the District of Columbia government that are specifically included in the service by statute. The SES is a cadre of high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. While they are considered federal employees within the civil service system, they are governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. This report examines some of the central features and notable differences among these classifications. It will be updated as warranted by major legislative events or other developments. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33487, The Federal Government's Civil Service: Overview of Selected Positions and Appointment Processes, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10101, Federal Government Pay: Pay Structure, Adverse Action Protections and Procedures, by (author name also scrubbed) and [author names scrubbed].

The military compensation system is complex and includes an array of cash compensation elements, noncash compensation (benefits), deferred compensation (retirement pay, Thrift Savings Plan, retiree health care, and other retirement benefits), and tax advantages. Cash compensation takes a variety of forms and includes basic pay, housing and subsistence allowances, enlistment bonuses, skill proficiency pay, and additional pay for particularly demanding or dangerous duty. Non cash compensation includes various benefits such as medical and dental care, government-provided housing, educational benefits, space-available travel on military aircraft, and access to subsidized grocery stores (commissaries), retail stores (exchanges), and child care centers. The main elements of deferred compensation are retired pay and retireehealth care, but commissary and exchange access, space available travel, and certain other benefits are also part of this. Servicemembers may also participate in the Thrift savings plan (TSP), although until 2018 they generally did not receive matching contributions from the government. However, recent changes to the military retirement system made matching contributions to the Thriftsubsidies Plan a key component of many servicemember's deferred compensation starting in 2018. Regular Military Compensation (RMC) is a statutorily defined measure of the cash or in-kind compensation elements that all military personnel receive every payday. It is widely used as a basic measure of military cash compensation levels and for comparisons with civilian salary levels. RMC is usually preferred over basic pay when comparing military with civilian compensation, analyzing the standards of living of military personnel, or studying military compensation trends over time. Basic pay is the largest element of RMC and typically accounts for about two-thirds of an individual's RMC. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is paid to servicemember's living in the United States and overseas, regardless of the actual housing expenses incurred. Housing allowances are paid to the servicemmer at the specified rate regardless of his or her actual housing costs. Food is paid at a uniform rate to all eligible enlisted personnel, and at a lower but lower rate for all eligible officers. Federal Tax Advantage Certain types of military compensation are not subject to federal income tax, thus generating a tax benefit for military personnel. Military allowances, on the other hand, are generally not considered part of gross income and are not taxed; thus, RMC considers only the federal tax advantage provided by the exemption of BAH and BAS from gross income. Compensation Elements Not Included in RMC RMC does not include the full array of compensation elements (e.g., special pays and bonuses, reimbursements, educational assistance, deferred compensation, or any estimate of thecash value of nonmonetary benefits). As the value of these forms of compensation can be very substantial, R MC should not be considered a measure of total military compensation.
The United States has provided Egypt with large amounts of military assistance since the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty, which ushered in the current era of U.S. financial support for peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The United States is not a legal party to the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty and does not have any obligations under the treaty itself. However, as the peace broker between Egypt and Israel, the United States traditionally provided foreign aid to both countries to ensure a regional balance of power and sustain security cooperation with both countries. Egypt receives the bulk of foreign aid funds from three primary accounts: Foreign Military Financing (FMF), Economic Support Funds (ESF), and International Military Education and Training (IMET). Congress typically specifies a precise allocation of most foreign assistance for Egypt in the foreign operations appropriations bill. Since FY2012, however, Congress has required the Administration to certify that certain conditions had been met before releasing FMF funds, thereby eliminating their automatic early disbursal. In FY2018, the Administration obligated $1 billion in FY2018 FMF for Egypt, which remains available to be expended until September 30, 2019. For FY2019, the President requested a total of $1.381 billion in foreign assistance to Egypt, the same amount requested for the previous year. Nearly all of the requested funds for Egypt are for the FMF account. The FY2020 request for Egypt is nearly identical from previous years as the President is seeking a total in bilateral assistance for FY2020. The Trump Administration has praised the Egyptian government's counterterrorism efforts while its Administration has worked to restore high-level diplomatic engagement, joint military exercises, and arms sales. The Administration has withheld some foreign assistance on at least one occasion for policy reasons, and there has not been an ambassador in Cairo since June 30, 2017. Egypt's poor record on human rights and democratization has sparked regular criticism from some Members of Congress. Some Members have passed appropriations legislation that withholds the obligation of FMF to Egypt until the Secretary of State certifies that Egypt is taking various steps toward supporting democracy and human rights. With the exception of FY2014, lawmakers have included a national security waiver to allow Congress to waive these congressionally mandated certification requirements under certain conditions. The Egyptian government has taken several steps to reform the economy, including depreciating the currency, reducing fuel subsidies, enacting a value-added tax (VAT), and providing cash payments to the poor in lieu of subsidizing household goods (though many food subsidies continue). Egypt's energy sector also is contributing to the economy's rebound. Egypt is the largest oil producer in Africa outside of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the third-largest natural gas producer on the continent following Algeria and Nigeria. In December 2017, an Egyptian and Italian partnership began commercial output from the Zohr natural gas field (est. 30 trillion cubic feet of gas), the largest ever gas field discovered in the Mediterranean Sea. Egypt also has repaid debts owed to foreign energy companies, allowing for new investments from BP and BG Group. In January 2019, Egypt convened the first ever Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum (EMGF), a regional consortium consisting of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Cyprus, Greece, and Italy, intended to consolidate regional energy policies and reduce costs. In February 2018, Egypt hosted the first-ever European Union-Arab summit in Sharm el Sheikh, where officials discussed terrorism, migration, and the need for greater European-Arab cooperation to counter a perceived growing Chinese and Russian interest in the Middle East. In March 2018, President Sisi was elected head of the African Union for a year-long term, and his supporters have proposed a set of amendments to the constitution which, if approved by parliament and public referendum, have the potential to make him eligible for an additional two six-year terms when his current term ends in 2022. The U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and the Libyan National Army (LNA) movement, is seeking to restore order in eastern Libya and reunite the Libyan army. The GNA and the LNA are closely aligned with Egypt, as both figures hail from the military and broadly oppose Islamist political forces. A 2019 LNA offensive into southern Libya has placed additional pressure on the government and may complicate efforts by the United Nations to facilitate a national dialogue, constitutional referendum, and elections in 2019.
This report provides a comprehensive summary of the federal financial assistance provided to the Gulf Coast states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas in response to the widespread destruction that resulted from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005 and Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. The damages caused by the hurricanes are some of the worst in the history of the United States in terms of lives lost and property damaged and destroyed. The federal government played a significant role in the response to these hurricanes and Congress appropriated funds for a wide range of activities and efforts to help the Gulf coast states recover and rebuild from the storms. In addition, Congress appropriated a significant amount of funds for mitigation activities and projects to reduce or eliminate the impacts of future storms. Though the storms happened over a decade ago, Congress remains interested in the types and amounts of federal assistance that were provided for several reasons. For one, Congress continues to be interested in how the money has been spent, what resources have been provided, and whether the funds have reached the people and entities intended to receive the funds. The financial information is also useful for congressional oversight and evaluation of federal entities that were responsible for response and recovery operations. Similarly, it gives Congress a general idea of the types of federal assets that are needed and can be brought to bear when catastrophic disasters take place in the United states. As such, the financial information can help frame the congressional debate concerning federal assistance for current and future disasters. This report includes a summary of appropriations provided by Congress for the 2005 and 2008 Gulf Coast hurricanes. When available, hurricane-specific and state-specific funding information is provided by a federal entity. In the course of this research, CRS identified 11 federal departments, 4 federal agencies (or other entities), and numerous subentities, programs, and activities that supplied roughly $121.7 billion in federal assistance after the major hurricanes of 2005 (Katrina, Wilma, and Rita) and 2008 (Gustav and Ike). This report will be updated as warranted by major disasters that occur in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. For example, P.L. 110-329, signed into law on September 30, 2008, provided funds for several disasters that occurred in 2008, including Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, wildfires in California, and floods in the Midwest and South, as well as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The report will also provide information on the federal role in responding to major disasters occurring in 2005, including the following: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The DRF is used to fund existing recovery projects (including reimbursements to other federal agencies for their work) and provide funding for future emergencies and disasters as needed. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. The CDBG program provides funds to states, Puerto Rico, and eligible (entitlement) communities to fund eligible housing, neighborhood revitalization, and economic development activities. Department of Defense (Military). The Military Construction and Family Housing Construction accounts fund the planning, design, and construction of military facilities and infrastructure that were damaged or destroyed by hurricane winds and water. The Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) Civil Works Program provides funds for the Corps' water resources work related to the five hurricanes, including hurricane protection and flood damage reduction projects, and performs emergency actions for flood and coastal emergencies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI is the lead federal investigative agency charged with defending the country against foreign terrorist and intelligence threats; enforcing federal criminal laws; and providing leadership and criminal justice services to federal, state, municipal, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies and partners. The FBI collects and disseminates national crime data through the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and operates several national information sharing systems such as the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), the Next Generation Identification System (N-Dexter), the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NCICIC), and the National Crime Information Center (NICS). Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ provides legal advice and opinions, upon request, to the President and executive branch department heads. The DOJ has received a total of $287.5 million in supplemental appropriations for departmental expenses related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and to award grants to Gulf Coast state governments. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The BOP's mission is to protect society by confining offenders in prisons and community
U.S.-Turkey relations have been strained in recent years over a number of issues, including U.S. concerns about Turkey's commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Western orientation of the alliance, Turkey's military intervention in Syria's civil war, and the Turkish government's efforts to expand its influence in the Middle Eastern region. These issues have contributed to tensions between the United States and Turkey over the past several years, including the apparent October 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate. In the 115th Congress, Members of Congress introduced various legislative proposals to address these issues. The most significant congressional action against Turkey to date has been an arms embargo that Congress enacted in 1975 in response to Turkish military action in Cyprus. That embargo lasted from 1975 to 1978. The House-passed Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 648) contains foreign aid provisions that also have been introduced in the Senate Appropriations Committee. President Trump's announcement in December 2018 that he would withdraw approximately 2,000 troops from Syria has major implications for Turkey and the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), a Syrian Kurdish militia with links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) that has waged an on-and-off insurgency against the government of Turkey since the 1980s. The United States has a long-standing alliance with Turkey, and Turkey is a NATO member and a member of the European Union (EU). Turkey's location near several global hotspots makes the continuing availability of its territory for the stationing and transport of arms, cargo, and personnel valuable for the United Nations Security Council and NATO. From Turkey's perspective, NATO's traditional value has been to mitigate its concerns about encroachment by neighbors. Turkey initially turned to the West largely as a reaction to aggressive post-World War II posturing by the Soviet Union. Since then, Turkey has sought to strengthen its ties with the West through a variety of diplomatic, economic, military, and political initiatives. However, its efforts to increase its influence and offer it as a "model" for other regional states appear to have been set back by several developments since 2011: (1) conflict and instability that engulfed the region and Turkey's own southern border, (2) Turkey's failed effort to help Muslim Brotherhood-aligned groups gain lasting power in Syria and North Africa, and (3) domestic polarization accompanied by government repression. In addition, the Turkish economy appears to be slowing down, with negative consequences both for consumer demand and for companies seeking or repaying loans in global markets. Economic growth was down from over 7% in 2017 to around 3% in 2018, with forecasts for 2019 at or below 1%. By the end of 2018, inflation had essentially doubled year-on-year to more than 20%. The Turkish lira depreciated close to 30% against the dollar in an environment featuring a globally stronger dollar, rule of law concerns and political uncertainty, and significant corporate debt. Some observers speculate that Turkey may need to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a financial assistance package. This would be a sensitive challenge for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan because his political success story is closely connected with helping Turkey become independent from its most recent IMF intervention in the early 2000s. In January 2019, Turkish parliament voted to grant Erdogan broader emergency powers in case of a financial crisis. Local elections scheduled for March 2019 could be a significant barometer of domestic support for Erdogan under the difficult economic circumstances described below. This report will be updated as events warrant.
The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program (PSOB) is a federal program that provides cash benefits to eligible public safety officers who are permanently and totally disabled or who die as a result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty. PSOB death and disability benefits are paid in addition to any other workers' compensation, life insurance, or other benefits paid for the death of a public safety officer. The PSOB program is administered by the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and is authorized by Section 611 of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act; P.L. 107-56). This report provides an overview of the PSOB benefits program and describes the eligibility requirements to be eligible for these benefits. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants. For additional information on PSOB, see CRS Report RL33476, Public Safety Officer's Benefits: An Overview, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10130, Public Security Officers: Background and Issues for Congress, coordinated by [ author name scrubbing] (pdf). For a general overview of PSOB and PSOEA benefits, see the following CRS products: CRS Legal Sidebar WSLG-17-854, Public safety officer benefits: overview, eligibility, and application process; CRS Reports RL33498, PSOB Benefits: Overview, application process, and reporting requirements; and    CRS Issue Brief IB10140, Publicsafety officers' education assistance: Public safety officers' educational assistance program, by Kristin M. Finklea. For more information on the death or disability of a PSOB officer, please consult the following resources: http://www.crs.gov/Pages/default.aspx?articleID=103033, Public-Safety-Officers-Benefits-Programs-for-Death-and-Disability, by Kristen M.Finklea;   CRS Report 98-1105, Death and Disability Benefits for Public Safety officers: Overview and Application Process, byKristin Fletea; or  Â   This report also includes a brief discussion of the Public Safety Corps' Educational Assistance (PSOEA) program, which provides financial assistance with costs associated with higher education to the spouse or children of apublic safety officer who is eligible for PSOBDeath or disability benefits.
USAspending.gov is a government source for data on federal grants, contracts, loans, and other financial assistance. The website enables searching of federal awards from FY2008 to the present by state, congressional district (CD), county, and zip code. Grant awards include money the federal government commits for projects in states, local jurisdictions, regions, territories, and tribal reservations, as well as payments for eligible needs to help individuals and families. Contract awards refer to bids and agreements the government makes for specific goods and services. In addition, grants may be characterized by how the funding is awarded, such as by formula, by project, or by matching state and local funds. As recipients of federal grant funding, states and local governments may provide services directly to beneficiaries or states may act as a pass-through, disbursing grant funding to localities using a formula or a competitive process. As a result, federal grant and procurement awards thus may have a where awarded vs. where spent component that is not fully identified in grant or procurement records. For Congress, the ability to more accurately track these federal awards is necessary to better inform oversight of federal spending. In recent years, Congress has passed laws to create and improve systems used by government departments and agencies to report and input data on the federal awards for contracts and grants. P.L. 109-282, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA), called for the creation of a database that became USAspenders.gov. The publicly available database replaced data collection and annual reports issued for more than 30 years in the Census Bureau's Federal Aid to States (FAS) report and Consolidated Federal Funds Report (CFFR). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) required federal agencies awarding stimulus funding to report spending back to the ARRA Recovery Board; this reporting also became a part of USAsPending.com. The Digital Accountability and transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) transferred responsibility for the database from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and required that expenditures data be added to the federal agency obligations data already included in the database. The DATA Act also required Treasury and OMB to develop government-wide data standardization to facilitate consolidating, automating, and simplifying reports on grant awards and contracts and to improve underreporting and inconsistencies as identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in June 2014. However, finding accurate and complete data on funds received by states and congressional districts continues to be challenging due to ongoing data quality problems. A GAO report released in November 2017 assessed the quality of data reported by agencies in May 2017 under new DATA Act standards. GAO identified issues and challenges with the completeness and accuracy of the data submitted, use of data elements, and disclosure of data limitations on what was, at the time, a beta version of the new website. The beta version has since become the official site as of March 2018 and the previous version is no longer available.
The federal government subsidizes a wide range of activities through the tax code. The majority of available tax incentives are claimed directly by the party engaged in the activity targeted by the subsidy. There are several tax credits, however, that often require or encourage the intended beneficiary of the subsidy to partner with a third party to use the tax incentive. This may happen because the tax credits are nonrefundable and the intended beneficiaries of the tax credit have little or no tax liability (e.g., a nonprofit), or because the credits are delivered over multiple years whereas upfront funding is needed to break a round. This situation often results in a tax equity transaction—the intended beneficiary agrees to transfer the rights to claim the credits to a third-party in exchange for an equity financing contribution. Tax equity investments are not a statutorily defined term, but rather identify transactions that pair the tax incentives or other tax benefits generated by a qualifying physical investment with the capital financing associated with that investment. These transactions involve one party agreeing to assign the right to claim these tax credits to another party in exchangefor an equity investment (i.e., cash financing). The exchange is sometimes referred to as "monetizing," "selling," or "trading" the credits. This report provides an introduction to the general tax equity financing mechanism. To facilitate the presentation of this approach to subsidization, three categories of tax credits that either currently use or have recently used this mechanism are examined: the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC); the new markets tax Credit (NMTC); and two energy-related tax credits—the renewable electricity production tax credits (PTC and energy investment tax credit). This report does not evaluate the economic rationale for subsidizing the activities targeted by these tax credit, and does not analyze whether these subsidies increase net investment in these activities. Instead, this report focuses on explaining the structure and functioning of tax equity arrangements. The report also presents several policy options that could be considered with respect to the tax equity approach, including making the credits refundable, converting them to grants, allowing the direct transfer of credits, accelerating the credits, and reducing the time period over which they are claimed. These policy options are presented in three categories: (1) LIHTC, (2) NMTC, and (3) renewable energy tax credits. All of these options are discussed in more detail in the "Policy Options and Considerations" section of the report, which also provides a brief overview of each of the three tax credits and provides examples of how they are used in practice.
Social Security provides dependent benefits and survivors benefits, sometimes collectively referred to as auxiliary benefits, to the spouses, former spouses, widow(er)s, children, and parents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. Auxiliary benefits are based on the work record of the household's primary earner. Although Social Security is often viewed as a program that primarily provides benefits to retired or disabled workers, 33% of new benefit awards in 2017 were made to the dependents and survivors of retired and disabled workers. Social Security spousal benefits (i.e., benefits for a wife or husband of the primary earer) are payable to the spouse or divorced spouse of a retired and/or disabled worker. Survivors benefits are paid to the survivors of a deceased worker as a widow, a child, a mother or father of the deceased worker's child(ren), or as a dependent parent of the dead worker. Spousal and survivor benefits play an important role in ensuring women's retirement security. However, women continue to be vulnerable to poverty in old age, due to demographic and economic reasons. Women on average live longer than men, and thus more women are likely to be widowed than are men. Women are more likely to take employment breaks to care for children or parents and thus have a lower labor force participation rate than men. The median earnings of women who are full-time wage and salary workers are 82% of their male counterparts. In addition, the design of auxiliary benefits can lead to equity concerns. For example, a woman who was never employed but is married to a man with high Social Security-covered wages may receive a Social Security benefit that is higher than the retirement benefit received by a single woman, who worked a full career in a low-wage job. The current system provides proportionately more benefits relative to payroll-tax contributions to one-earner couples (which predominated when Social Security was created in the 1930s) than to single persons or to couples with two earners, on average. As women's share of household income has increased, and also as women have increasingly become heads of families, these anomalies could become more relevant. In response to the adequacy, equity, and other program design issues described above, policymakers and researchers have proposed a number of ways to restructure Social Security auxiliary benefits. These proposals have different potential consequences for benefit levels of current, divorced, and surviving spouses; for redistribution of benefits among couples from different socioeconomic levels; for the eligibility of means-tested programs such as Supplemental Security Income; and for work incentives. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a federal agency established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; P.L. 93-406). It was created to protect the participants and beneficiaries of private sector defined benefit (DB) pension plans. These pension plans provide a specified monthly benefit at retirement, usually either a percentage of salary or a flat dollar amount multiplied by years of service. PBGC runs two distinct insurance programs: one for single-employer pension plans and a second for multiemployer plans. In FY2018, PBGC insured about 25,000 DB pension plans covering about 37 million people. It paid or owed benefits to 1.4 million people in 4,919 DB plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployers. The PBGC is a government-owned corporation. A three-member board of directors, chaired by the Secretary of Labor, administers the corporation. The Secretary of Commerce and the Department of the Treasury are the other members of the board. The Director of PBGC was appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Board of Directors meet at least four times each year. The President also appoints a seven-member Advisory Committee to advise PBGC on issues, such as investment of funds, plan liquidations, and other matters. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P-L. 112-141) altered some of the governance structures of PBGA. Some of these changes include setting the term of the PBGC Director at five years, unless removed by the president or by the board of Directors; requiring that the Board of directors meet at at least 4 times eachyear; and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate within PBGC to act as a liaison between PBGC, participants in plans trusteed by PBGC and the sponsors of pension plans insured by PBGA, and the participants in pension plans that are insured by the agency. PBGA is required by ERISA to be self-supporting and receives no appropriations from general revenue. The most reliable source of PB GC revenue is the premiums set by Congress and paid by the private-sector employers that sponsor DB pension plan plans. Other sources of income are assets from terminated plans taken over byPBGC, investment income, and recoveries collected from companies when they end underfunded pension plans, and transfers from the trust fund that are used to pay for participants' benefits. The federal budget includes PBGC's receipts and disbursements from the revolving funds, which contain the premiums paid by pension plan sponsors, returns on revolving funds' investments in U.S. Treasury securities, and PBGC benefit payments. The revolving funds contain assets of $33.2 billion as of the end of FY2018. In its FY2017 Projections Report, PB GC estimated its financial condition over the next 10 years. The report indicated that the singleemployer program's deficit is likely to shrink and the multiemployernational program's deficits are likely to increase. The multiemployER program is expected to run out of money in FY2025. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA, enacted as part of P. l. 113-235) allowed, among other provisions, plans that expect to become insolvent to reduce benefits to participants in these plans. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a new joint select committee of the House and Senate: the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployers Pension Plans. The committee was tasked with formulating recommendations and legislative language by November 30, 2018, that would "significantly improve the solvency" of multi employer DB plans. It did not release a report by the deadline.
The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and Central Utah Project (CUP), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and a number of independent agencies. For FY2020, President Trump submitted his FY2020 detailed budget proposal to Congress on March 18, 2019 (after submitting a general budget overview on March 11). The budget requests for agencies included in this bill total $38.02 billion—$6.64 billion (15%) below the FY2019 appropriation. A $1.309 billion increase (12%) is proposed for Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear weapons activities. The FY2020 budget request proposes substantial reductions for DOE energy research and development (R&D) programs, including a reduction of $178 million (-24%) in fossil fuels and $502 million (-38%) in nuclear energy. Energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D would decline by $1,724 billion (-83%). DOE science programs would be reduced by $ 1.039 billion (-16%). For FY2019, the conference agreement on H.R. 5895 (H.Rept. 115-929) provided total Energy and water development appropriations of $44.66 billion—3% above the FY2018 level and 23% above a FY2019 request. The bill was signed by the President on September 21, 2018 (P.L.115-244). Figures for FY2019 exclude emergency supplemental appropriations totaling $17.419 billion provided to USACE and DOE for natural disaster response by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, signed February 9, 2018.

This report provides background information for Congress on the levels of Department of Defense (DOD) military servicemembers and contractor personnel deployed in support of prior and ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. For more information on DOD's use of contractor personnel, see CRS In Focus IF10600, Defense Primer: DOD Contractors, by Heidi M. Peters and Moshe Schwartz and CRS Report R43074, DOD's Use of Contractors to Support Military Operations: Background, Analysis, and Issues for Congress, byMoshe Schwartz. This report will be updated as events warrant. For further information on U.S. military operations and contractor staffing levels in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, see the following CRS reports: CRS Reports R44405, Afghanistan: Overview of U. S. Military Operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, by Eric L. Lovell, and R44406, Iraq: Status of Operations in Syria, by [author name scrubbed]. For more detailed information on contractor staffing in the Middle East and North Africa (Mideast), see the Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report R44408, Contractor Staffing Levels in the Mideast: Overview, Analysis and Issues in Congress, coordinated by Kristin M. Finklea-Mann. For additional information on the use of contractors by DOD to support military operations, including the number of contractors deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iraq and Syria as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2018, see GAO-2019, Contracting in the United States: Trends in Military Operations, by Kristine M.F. M. Mlettea and [author names scrubbed] and the House-passed version of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, H.R. 2810). For more than a decade, Congress has been concerned about DOD's reliance on contractors to perform a wide range of military operations. For example, the Commission on Wartime Contracting, in its 2011 final report to Congress, expressed its view that operations in Afghanistan between FY2002 and FY2011 had led to an "unhealthy over-reliance" on contractors by the DOD, Department of State, and United States Agency for International Development (USAID. In addition, in February 2017, General John Nicholson, then Commander of the NATO Resolute Support Mission and United United States Forces–Afghanistan, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that DOD had to "substitute contractors for soldiers in order to meet the force manning levels" in Afghanistan. In FY2018, the House passed the NDAA for FY2019, which included a provision (Section 923) that would have expressed the sense of Congress that the DOD should discourage the practice of substituting contractor personnel for available members of the Armed Forces when a unit deploys overseas. This section also would have required the Secretary of Defense to provide a related briefing to the congressional defense committees. The Senate did not include a similar provision in its FY2019 NDAA.
On the day a vetoed bill and accompanying presidential message are received, the Speaker lays the message before the House. The veto message is read and entered in the House Journal. It is not necessary for a Member to make a motion to reconsider the vetoed bill. If the House successfully overrides a veto of a bill that originated in the Senate (S. or S.J. Res. ), the bill and veto message are sent to the Senate for action. If a Senate-originated bill is successful in the override vote, then the bill becomes law, because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to override the veto. The Senate generally reconsiders a vetoed measure under the terms of a unanimous consent agreement, but it does not need to have the support of all 100 Senators to do so. This report will be updated as events warrant.

On December 20, 2018, President Trump signed into law a new five-year omnibus farm bill, the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334; the 2018 farm bill). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will implement the provisions, most of which take effect in calendar year 2019. Title I of the farm bill includes 12 titles covering different program areas. The first title, Title I—Commodities, authorizes several major revenue support and disaster assistance programs. Aside from dairy and sugar, which have their own specific programs, most grain and oilseed crops produced in the United States are eligible for two tiers of revenue support under Title I. Specialty crops such as fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts are not covered. The marketing assistance loan (MAL) program offers a minimum price guarantee for production of "loan" commodities in the form of a short-term loan at statutorily set prices. The MAL program may be supplemented by two other programs: (1) the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, which provides price protection via statutory fixed "reference" prices for eligible crops, or (2) the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program that provides revenue protection via historical moving average revenue guarantees based on the five most recent years of crop prices and yields. PLC and ARC are available for producers that own or rent historical "base" acres of "covered" commodities. The sugar and dairy sectors are supported by separate federal farm programs that are tailored more specifically to the physical differences associated with each of their products—refined sugar and liquid fresh milk—and their respective markets. Disaster assistance is available for most tree crops and livestock. The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program provides assistance for all agricultural commodities not covered by a federal crop insurance policy. The Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) provides payments to producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish as compensation for losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, or other conditions (such as wildfires) not covered under LIP or LFP. All of these Title I programs existed under the previous 2014 farm bill. The farm revenue support program provisions from Title I are largely preserved but with some modifications. For example, the MAL loan program is no longer subject to annual payment limits, and the PLC program no longer requires farmers to plant a particular crop to be eligible for a PLC payment. In addition, the ARC and PLC payments are decoupled from actual crop plantings and are made on a portion of a crop's enrolled base acres rather than on the farm's actual production. The 2017 farm bill also added seed cotton as a covered commodity, but not as a loan commodity, and removed upland cotton from eligibility for the ARC or PLC programs. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement (BBA) of 2018, which was signed by President Trump on December 11, 2017, made substantial changes to both the dairy program and the treatment of cotton under the P LC and ARC programs. Under the BBA, seed cotton was added to a producer's base acres and thus eligible for either PLC or ARC payments. The 2018 farm bills also added a provision that suspends the relevant price support provisions of permanent law for the crop (and marketing) years 2019-2023. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects USDA spending for Title I farm commodity and disaster programs at $31.3 billion annually, including projected annual outlays of $4.1 billion for PLC, $1.2 billion for ARC, and $2.0 billion for the noninsured crop disaster assistance program. This contrasts with estimated annual outlaying on Title I commodity programs under the 2014 farm bills of $7.2 million, including $1 billion in outlays on PLC.
In 1996, Congress enacted the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to expedite the rulemaking process for certain agency actions. Under the CRA, before a rule can take effect, an agency must submit to both houses of Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) a report containing a copy of the rule and information on the rule, including a summary of the rules, a designation of whether the rule is "major," and the proposed effective date. After a rule is received by Congress, Members have the opportunity to use expedited procedures to overturn the rule. A Member must submit the resolution of disapproval and Congress must take action on it within certain time periods specified in the CRA to take advantage of the expedite procedures, which exist primarily in the Senate. Those expedited, or "fast track," procedures include the following: a Senate committee can be discharged from the further consideration of a CRA joint resolution disapproving the rule by a petition signed by at least 30 Senators; any Senator may make a nondebatable motion to proceed to consider the disapproval resolution, and if the motion is successful, the CRA disapproval resolution would be subject to up to 10 hours of debate, and then voted upon. No amendments are permitted and the resolution requires a simple majority to pass. If both houses pass the joint resolution, it is sent to the President for signature or veto. If the President were to veto the resolution, Congress could vote to override the veto under normal veto override procedures. If a joint resolution of disapprove is submitted and acted upon within the CRA-specified deadlines and signed by the President (or if Congress overrides the President's veto), the CRA states that the "rule shall not take effect (or continue)." In other words, if part or all of therule had already taken effect, the rule would be deemed not to have had any effect at any time. The CRA does not define what would constitute a "rule" that is "substantially the same" as a nullified rule. However, it does include some non-legislative rules that inherently lack legal effect, such as general policy statements that are not legally binding and that do not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. This report provides a brief overview of the CRA. It begins with a discussion of the definition of "rule," followed by a brief discussion of how the CRA incorporates the APA's definition of rule. Next, the report discusses some of the procedural requirements that must be met in order for an agency action to be considered a rule under the CRA and how these requirements have been interpreted by courts. The report concludes with a review of the 21 opinions that GAO has issued since 1996 on whether agency actions are "rules" and, thus, eligible for the CRA's expedited review procedures.
The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was originally enacted in 1994 (P.L. 103-322). It addressed congressional concerns about violent crime, and violence against women in particular, in several ways. Among other things, it allowed for enhanced sentencing of repeat federal sex offenders; mandated restitution to victims of specified federal sex offenses; and authorized grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women. VAWA has been reauthorized three times since its original enactment. Most recently, in 2013, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Violence Against women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013; P.L., 113-4). This reauthorization reauthorized most of the programs authorized under VAW a through FY2018. In addition, it amended and authorized appropriations for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, enhanced measures to combat trafficking in persons, and amended the purpose areas for several grants to address sex trafficking. It also added new provisions to address states' rape kit backlogs and gave American Indian tribes authority to enforce tribal laws pertaining to domestic violence and related crimes against non-tribal members. The act also established a nondiscrimination provision to ensure that victims are not denied services and are not subjected to discrimination based on actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability. It enhanced protection of personally identifiable information of victims and specified the type of information that may be shared by grantees and subgrantees. It required that any grantee or subgrantsee that provides legal assistance must comply with certifications required under the Legal Assistance for Victims Grant Program. It added, modified, or expanded several definitions of terms in the act. For example, the definition of domestic violence was revised to specifically include "intimate partners" in addition to "current and former spouses" and the term linguistically was removed from the Culturally Specific Services Grant. The definition of "culturally specific services" was amended to address the needs of culturally specific communities. With respect to providing VAWa-related services, the act added the terms population specific services and population specific organizations, which focus on "members of a specific underserved population." Underserved populations was redefined to include those who may be discriminated against based on religion, sexual Orientation, or gender identity. The term cyberstalking was expanded to include use of any "electronic communication device or electronic communication service or electronic communications system of interstate commerce." The act added a new category of bias applicable to hate crime reporting (i.e., national origin and gender identity) and created new reporting requirements for institutions of higher education (IHEs). It also amended the federal criminal code to revise the crime of interstate stalking to (1) include placing someone under surveillance with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate that person; and (2) require consideration of substantial emotional harm to the stalking victim. In FY2018 and FY2019, $553 million and $559 million, respectively, were appropriated for programs administered by the Office of Violence against Women (OVW), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since its creation, OVW has awarded more than $8 billion in grants and cooperative agreements to states, tribal, and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and universities. While OVW administers the majority of VAW A-authorized grants, other federal agencies, including the CDC and OJP, also manage V AWA programs. While authorizations of appropriations for OVW have expired, the Administration has requested $492.5 million for FY2020 (a 1% decrease from FY2019), all of which would be derived from a transfer from the Crime Victims Fund. The Administration has also requested $9.0 million for OJP and $49.4 million for the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for the Rape Prevention and Education Program at the CDC. In May 2015, as part of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (Title IV, P. l. 114-22), the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act was enacted into law. It requires the Attorney General (through OVW) to increase grant funding under the State Victimization Assistance Program (STOP) formula grant programs to states that have a law allowing the mother of a child conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of
This report identifies selected current major trade issues for U.S. agriculture that may be of interest to the 116th Congress. It provides background on individual trade issues and attempts to bring perspective on the significance of each for the agricultural sector. Each trade issue summary concludes with an assessment of its current status. The report begins by examining a series of overarching issues. These issues include U. S. agricultural trade and its importance to the agriculture sector, a brief description of the trade policy being pursued by the Trump Administration and its ramifications for agricultural exports, the Administration's actions to mitigate the economic impact on agriculture from retaliatory actions by trading partners against its trade policies, and the implications for agriculture of the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. In addition, the report then reviews a number of ongoing trade disputes and trade negotiations while also examining a variety of narrower trade issues of importance to agriculture. The format for these more focused trade issues is similar, consisting of background on the issue at hand and a review of its status. During the calendar years 2017 and 2018, the value of U. s. agricultural exports accounted for 8% and 9% of total U.s. exports, respectively, and 5% of the nation's total imports, according to the United States Census data. Exports in FY2018 were $143 billion, $3 billion above the FY2017 total but almost $11 billion below the peak of $152.3 billion in FY2014. The decline in farm exports since FY2014 initially reflected lower market prices for bulk commodities, such as soybeans and corn, which were further affected in 2018 by retaliatory tariffs imposed on selected agricultural imports by China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and Turkey in response to the Trump administration's imposition of Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum and Section 301 tariffs on certain imports from China. The United States is currently engaged in bilateral trade negotiations with China in an attempt to resolve the current trade dispute, which has resulted in retaliatory tariff increases on a wide range of agricultural products. The Trump Administration's trade policy actions have in some cases resulted in retaliateatory tariffs against agricultural product exports, while the status of new agreements with several important agricultural trading partners such as Canada and Mexico remains uncertain. On July 24, 2018, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that the USDA would authorize up to $12 billion in financial assistance—referred to as a trade aid package—for certain agricultural commodities using the authority provided under Section 5 of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act. The largest component of the aid package, the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), provides direct financial assistance to producers of commodities that are most impacted by actions of foreign governments resulting in the loss of traditional exports. USDA announced MFP per-unit payment rates to be applied to production of eligible commodities from September 2018 to February 2019. Eligible participants had to meet additional criteria, including being "actively engaged in farming," having an average adjusted gross income of less than $900,000, meeting conservation compliance provisions, and certifying their 2018 production with USDA by May 1, 2019. On May 10, 2019, Secretary Perdue tweeted that the White House had directed USDA to work on a new aid package. In March 2019, USDA estimated that a total of $8.7 billion in outlays would be made available under the MFP program, including $5.2 billion in 2018 and $3.5 billion in 2019. The large volume of payments could attract international attention about whether they are consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and commitments on domestic support. For instance, if theUnited States and China do not reach an agreement in their ongoing tariff-driven trade negotiations, should another trade aid program, or some alternative compensatory measure, be provided in 2019, and possibly beyond? If MFP payments are to be repeated in the future, should USDA revise its payment formulation to provide a broader distribution of payments across the U.L. agricultural sector?
Banks play a central role in the financial system by connecting borrowers to savers and allocating available funds across the economy. As a result, banking is vital to the U.S. economy's health and growth. Nevertheless, Banking is an inherently risky activity involving extending credit and undertaking liabilities. Therefore, banking can generate tremendous societal and economic benefits, but banking panics and failures can create devastating losses. Over time, a regulatory system designed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks has developed, and both banks and regulation have coevolved as market conditions have changed and different risks have emerged. For these reasons, Congress often considers policies related to the banking industry. The last decade has been a transformative period for banking. The 2007-2009 financial crisis threatened the total collapse of the banking system and the real economy. Many assert that only huge and unprecedented government interventions staved off this collapse. Others argue that government interventions were unnecessary or potentially exacerbated the crisis. In addition, many argue the crisis revealed that the financial systems was excessively risky and the regulatory regime governing the financial sector had serious weaknesses. Policymakers responded to the perceived weaknesses in the pre-crisis financial regulatory regime by implementing numerous changes to financial regulation, including to bank regulation. Most notably, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) in 2010 with the intention of strengthening regulation and addressing risks. In the ensuing years, some observers raised concerns that the potential benefits of those regulatory changes (e.g., better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, potentially higher economic growth over the long term) were outweighed by the potential costs (i.e., compliance costs incurred by banks, reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, potentially slower economic growth). In response to these concerns, Congress enacted the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer protection Act (EGRRCP Act, P. l. 115-174). Among other things, the law modified certain (1) regulations facing small banks; (2) regulations faced by banks large enough to be subjected to Dodd- Frank enhanced regulation but still below the size thresholds exceeded by the very largest banks; and (3) mortgage regulations facing lenders including banks. Additionally, federal banking regulatory agencies—the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)—have proposed further changes in regulation. In recent years—a period in which the leadership of the regulators has transferred from Obama Administration to Trump Administration appointees—the banking regulators have expressed the belief that, after having viewed the effects of the regulations, they now have the necessary information to determine which regulations may be ineffective or inefficient as currently implemented. Recently, these regulators have made of number of proposals with the aim of reducing regulatory burden. A key issue surrounding regulatory relief made pursuant to the EGRRCP act and regulator-initiated changes is whether regulatory burden can be reduced without undermining the goals and effectiveness of the rules. In particular, Congress faces questions related to whether tailoring in general or tailoring provided in specific regulations is sufficient to ensure that an appropriate trade-off has been struck between the benefits and costs of regulations facing community banks. Advocates for further regulatory relief argue that certain realized benefits are likely to be relatively small, whereas certain realized costs are probably relatively large. One area where the benefits may be relatively smaller for community banks relative to large banks is regulations aimed at improving systemic stability. Opponents of these arguments note that systemic risk is only one of the goals of regulation, along with prudential regulation and consumer protection. They note that community banks are exempted from many of the regulation aimed at systemic risk. Another potential rationale for easing regulations on community banks would be if there are economies of scale to regulatory compliance costs, meaning that compliance costs may decrease as a percentage of overall costs or revenues.
On January 6, 2011, after spending approximately $3 billion in developmental funding, the Marine Corps—with "encouragement" from the Department of Defense (DOD)—cancelled the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program. The EFV was intended to replace the 40-year-old Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), which currently transports Marines from ships to shore under hostile conditions. The Marine Corps cancelled the EFV due to excessive cost growth and poor performance in operational testing. Recognizing the need to replacement the AAV, the Pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a "more affordable and sustainable" vehicle to take the place of theEFV. In June 2013, citing budgetary pressures, the Marines reportedly put the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) program "on ice" and suggested that it might not be resurrected for about 10 years. In March 2014, in what was described as a "drastic shift," the Marines decided in March 2014 to "resurrect" the MPC and designate it as ACV Increment 1.1 and initially acquire about 200 vehicles. The Marines also plan to develop ACV increment 1.2, a tracked version, and to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. On April 23, 2014, the Navy and Marine Corps released a request for information (RFI) to industry for a prototype ACV. On November 5, 2014 the Marines released a draft request for proposal (RFP) for a new ACV version, known as the ACV 2.0, which is expected to enter production in 2025. The ACV 1.0 is to be capable of carrying 10 to 13 Marines plus crew, capable of high water speeds and deployment from ships far from the coast, and capable of operating on land alongside tanks and light armored vehicles. According to the Marines, ACV2.0 serves as a conceptual placeholder for a future Decision Point (~ 2025, or sooner) at which time knowledge gained in the fielding and employment of the first phase of ACV, the state of the naval connector strategy, and science & technology work towards a high water-speed capable self-deploying vehicle will support an informed decision. In December 2015, it was reported that General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) would protest the award of the contract to BAE Systems to build the first ACV to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), claiming the Marines asked for particular capabilities and then evaluated vendors by a different set of standards. On March 15, 2016, GAO denied GDLS's protest, noting that "the Marine Corps' evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the evaluation scheme identified in the solicitation." The Marines reportedly stated that the protest put the program about 45 days behind schedule but anticipated that the ACVs would still be fielded on time. In November 2015, the Corps awarded two contracts for the development of ACVs, each for $103.8 million, with the first to be delivered in November 2016. The second contract was awarded in December 2016 for $121.5 million, and the third contract in December 2018 for $140 million. In April 2016, the Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Marines planned to acquire 204 ACVs by the end of FY2020 to provide lift for two infantry battalions, with full operational capability (FOC) planned for FY2020. The FY2020 presidential budget request includes RDT&E and Procurement funding requests in the Base Budget, as well as FY2020 requested quantities. In addition, the FY2020 ACV budget request will fund ACV Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in FY2020, plus procurement of related items such as production support, systems engineering, program management, Engineering Change Orders (ECOs), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), and integrated logistics support. In February 2017, BAE systems and China's SAIC reportedly delivered the first two ACVs early, with BAE delivering its first prototype in December2016 and SAIC delivering its prototype in February 2017. In early December 2017, the U.S. Marine Corps reportedly sent a select request for proposals for the first of two ACV versions, with plans calling for operational testing to start in January 2018, with a contract winner to be announced in June 2018 for the delivery of 204 vehicles over a four-year period. In accordance with the provisions of the FY2014 National Defence
The debt limit is set forth as a dollar limitation in 31 U.S.C. 3101(b). From time to time, Congress considers and passes legislation to adjust or suspend this limit. Legislation adjusting the debt limit takes the form of an amendment to this statutory limit, usually striking the current dollar limitation and inserting a new one, usually with an increase to the dollar limit made administratively at the end of the suspension period. At the beginning of the 116th Congress, the House adopted a standing rule that would provide for legislation suspending the statutory debt limit to be considered as passed by the House, without a separate vote, when the House adopts the budget resolution for a fiscal year. This House rule is similar to a previous one related to the debt level (commonly referred to as the "Gephardt rule," named after its original sponsor, former Representative Richard Gephardt), which was first adopted in 1979 but was repealed at the start of the 112th Congress in 2011. This report first explains the current House debt limit rule, particularly in relation to the former Gephart rule. Then, it describes the legislative history of the former rule and reviews how the former rules operated before it was repealed. Finally, the report provides a brief overview of the new House rule, as well as a brief discussion of the previous rule. The Appendix provides a full text of the current rule and a table that summarizes the joint resolutions that were engrossed and deemed passed in the House pursuant to it during calendar years 1980-2010. The report will be updated as legislative events warrant. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33498, The House Debt Limit Rule: History and Current Issues, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10130, The Gephardar Rule: Legislative History and Recent Developments, coordinated by [ author name scrubbing], which will provide additional background on the former and current debt limit rules and precedents, as they pertain to debt limit legislation.

The term "child nutrition programs" refers to several U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food to children in institutional settings. The largest are the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), which subsidize free, reduced-price, and full-price meals in participating schools. Also operating in schools, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program provides funding for fruit and vegetable snacks in participating elementary schools, and the Special Milk Program provides support for milk in schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP. Other child nutrition programs include the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which provides meals and snacks in child care and after-school settings; the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), which provides food during the summer months; and the Summer Seamless Option (SSO) and Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) programs, which provide electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for school meals. In the 114th Congress, lawmakers began but did not complete child nutrition reauthorization, which refers to the process of reauthorizing and potentially making changes to multiple permanent statutes—the Richard B. Russell National School lunch Act, the Child Nutrition Act, and sometimes Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935. Both committees of jurisdiction—the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce—reported reauthorizations legislation (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003, respectively). This legislation died at the end of the 114 th Congress, as is the case for any bill that has not yet passed both chambers and been sent to the President at the beginning of a Congress. There were no significant child nutritionReauthorization efforts in the 115th Congress; however, 2018 farm bill proposals and the final enacted farm bill included a few provisions related to child nutrition. The implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296) and child nutrition-related topics raised during 2018 farm bills have raised issues that may be relevant for Congress in future reauthorized efforts or other policymaking opportunities. These issues often relate to the content and type of foods served in schools: for example, the nutritional quality of foods and whether foods are domestically sourced. Other issues relate to access, including alternatives to on-site consumption in summer meals and implementation of a Community Eligibility Provision, an option to provide free meals to all students in certain schools. Stakeholders in these issues commonly include school food authorities (SFAs; school food service departments that generally operate at the school district level), hunger and nutrition-focused advocacy organizations, and food industry organizations, among others. This report provides an overview of these and other current issues in the child Nutrition programs. It does not cover every issue, but rather provides a high-level review of some recent issues raised by Congress and/or program stakeholders, drawing examples from legislative proposals in the 114 and 115thCongresses. References to CRS reports with more detailed information or analysis on specific issues are provided where applicable, including the following:
U.S. foreign aid is the largest component of the international affairs budget, and each year, the foreign aid budget is the subject of congressional debate over the size, composition, and purpose of the program. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, global development has been cited as a third pillar of U. S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy, in the national security strategies of the George W. Bush and Barack Obama Administrations. Although the Trump Administration's National Security Strategy does not explicitly address the status of development vis-à-vis diplomacy and defense, it does note the historic importance of aid in achieving foreign policy goals and supporting U.S.-defined national interests. In FY2017, the United States provided some form of bilateral foreign assistance to more than 150 countries. Aid is concentrated heavily in certain countries, reflecting the priorities and interests of United States foreign policy at the time. Aid objectives include promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, improving governance, addressing population growth, expanding access to basic education and health care, protecting the environment, promoting stability in conflictive regions, protecting human rights, promoting trade, curbing weapons proliferation, strengthening allies, and addressing drug production and trafficking. The expectation has been that, by meeting these and other aid objectives, theUnited States will achieve its national security goals as well as ensure a positive global economic environment for American products, and demonstrate benevolent and respectable global leadership. There is considerable overlap among categories of aid. Multilateral aid serves many of the same objectives as bilateral development assistance, although through different channels. Military assistance, economic security aid—including rule of law and police training—and development assistance programs may support the same U.L. political objectives in the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, while military assistance and alternative development programs are integrated elements of American counternarcotics efforts in Latin America and elsewhere. The United States also provides assistance to countries of importance in the global counterterrorism strategy, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. In addition to the direct benefits derived from aid dollars used for American goods and services, many argue that the aid program brings significant indirect financial benefits to the United states. For example, analysts maintain that provision of military equipment through the military assistance program and food commodities through the Food for Peace program helps to develop future, strictly commercial, markets for those products. More broadly, as countries develop economically, they are in a position to purchase more goods from abroad and the United United States benefits as a trade partner. Since an increasing majority of global consumers are outside of the United Kingdom and the European Union, some business leaders assert that establishing strong economic and trade ties in the developing world, using foreign assistance as a tool, is key to economic and job growth. This report addresses a number of the more frequently asked questions regarding foreign aid. It attempts not only to present a current snapshot of American foreign assistance, but also to illustrate the extent to which this instrument of foreign policy has evolved over time. Data presented in the report are the most current, consistent, and reliable figures available, generally updated through FY2017. Dollar amounts come from a variety of sources, including the U.s. Agency for International Development (USAID) Foreign Aid Explorer database (Explorer) and annual State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations acts. As new data are obtained or additional issues and questions arise, the report will be revised.
The low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) to provide an incentive for the development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. These federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects via a competitive application process administered by state housing finance authorities (HFAs). Developers either use the credits or sell them to investors to raise capital for real estate projects, which, in turn, reduces the debt or equity contributions that would otherwise be required of developers. With lower financing costs, tax credit properties can potentially expand the supply of affordable housing. The LIHTC is estimated to cost the government an average of $9.9 billion annually. Two types of credits are available depending on the nature of the construction project. The so-called 9% credit is generally reserved for new construction, while the so- called 4% credit has been used for rehabilitation projects and new construction that is financed with tax-exempt bonds. Each year, for 10 years, a tax credit equal to roughly 4% or 9% of a project's qualified basis (cost of construction) is claimed. The applicable credit rates have historically not actually been 4% and 9%. Instead, the rates have fluctuated in response to market interest movements so that the program has delivered a subsidy equal to 30% of the present value of the qualified basis in the case of the 4%, and 70% in the cases of the 9%. Since 1986, the 4% rate has ranged between 3.15% and 3.97%, and the 9% rate between 7.35% and9.27%. Since 2008, however, there has been a floor under the 9%, below which the new construction credit rate cannot fall. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants.

Social Security, which paid about $989 billion in benefits in 2018, is the largest program in the federal budget in term s of outlays. Most Social Security beneficiaries are retired or disabled workers, whose monthly benefits depend on their past earnings, their age, and other factors. Benefits are also paid to workers' dependents and survivors, based on the earnings of the workers upon whose work record they claim. Social Security has a significant impact on beneficiaries, both young and old, in terms of income support and poverty reduction. Under current law, Social Security's revenues are projected to be insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits after 2035. Most proposals to change Social Security outlays would change the benefit computation rules. This report provides an overview of how Social Security benefits are computed under current law. It will be updated as needed. For additional information, see CRS Report RL32552, Social security: Calculation and History of Taxing Benefits, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10107, Socialsecurity: Benefits and Recent Changes in Law, by Mary Beth Nikitin and [author names scrubbed]. This report will not be updated again until Social Security reform legislation is enacted in the 112th Congress or after the first session of the 113th Congress, which will likely occur in the fall of 2019. For a general overview of current Social Security law, see the Social Security Administration website at http://www.Social Security Administration.gov/Pages/Social Security.aspx?id=1030. For information on disability benefits, see The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5, as amended). For a brief overview of benefits for retired workers and their dependents,see CRS Issue Brief IB95033, Disability Insurance: Benefits for Retired Workers, by Barbara A. Lynch. For more information on how the timing of benefit claim affects benefit levels, see  CRS Legal Sidebar WSLG1121, Retirement Benefits: How Timing of Benefit Claim Affects Benefit Levels, bymary Beth Lynne Lynch. In addition, this report will discuss other adjustments to benefits that apply in certain situations, including the windfall elimination provision (WEP), which reduces benefits for worker beneficiaries who have pensions from employment that was not subject to Social Security payroll taxes;    the government pension offset (GPO) which reduces Social Security spousal benefits paid to people who have jobs that were not covered by Social Security taxes; the retirement earnings test, which results in a withholding of monthly social Security benefits for beneficiaries who are younger than the full retirement age and have earnings above a certain level; and the maximum family benefit, which limits the amount of benefits payable to a family based on a worker's record. In some cases, a portion of social security benefits may be subject to federal income tax. Taxation is not a benefit adjustment, but it does affect the net income of beneficiaries.
Exposure to ozone (often referred to as "smog"), regardless of where that ozone originates, has been linked to negative human health effects, including respiratory ailments and premature death. Children, the elderly, and persons with respiratory illnesses are particularly susceptible to adverse health impacts from ozone exposure. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that ozone exposure was responsible for more than 15,000 premature deaths in the United States in 2007 based on 2006-2008 average ambient ozone concentrations. Concentrations of ozone at the ground level, originally considered a local issue, is increasingly recognized as a global challenge. Ozone is not emitted directly but is formed in the atmosphere from chemical reactions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with volatile organic compounds (VOCs, a type of hydrocarbon) in the presence of sunlight. NOx and VOCs are known as "precursor" emissions, and their relative contributions to the formation of ozone depends on a number of factors, including weather conditions and concentrations of other pollutants. The lifetime of ozone ranges from hours to weeks, providing time—under the right conditions—for pollution emitted in one location to affect the health and welfare of populations far downwind. While local emissions of ozone precursors are still the dominant source of ozone in many areas, state and local air quality agencies face ozone pollution arising from sources outside of their jurisdictional control ("background ozone"). The Clean Air Act (CAA) directs EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health (primary standards) and welfare (secondary standards). The law directs that "the attainment and maintenance of [primary standards] are requisite to protect the public health." While the standards are set to limit adverse impacts, EPA acknowledges that these standards do not suggest that concentrations below these levels present zero risk. There is no evidence of a safe level of ozone exposure below which no adverse health effects occur. However, uncertainty between exposure and health response increases at very low ozone concentrations—that is, below 20 parts per billion (ppb). As of 2018, with the 2015 ozone standard set at 70 ppb, there are 52 areas in the U.S. designated "nonattainment" for ozone. The CAA also mandates EPA to review the ozone standard every five years and revise them as appropriate. EPA completed its most recent review of the ozone standards in 2015, when it lowered the standard from 75 ppb to 70 ppB. EPA reported that it has begun the next ozone NAAQs review and that it intends to complete it by 2020. In 2018, EPA announced plans to streamline the NAAZS review process and obtain Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee advice regarding background pollution and potential adverse effects from compliance strategies. EPA's "Back-to-Basics" memorandum described concerns that background levels of pollution pose a challenge to meeting NAAS standards. The memorandum noted a call from certain state regulators for advice on how to treat background ozone, stating that "state environmental agencies have sought this advice, citing the 'absolute need for a valid source of information about background concentrations.'" The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology held a hearing on background ozone on June 21, 2018. Members of Congress may have an interest in better understanding background ozone from natural and international sources, particularly as EPA reviews its 2015 ozone standards. This report will discuss background air pollution primarily in the context of ground-level ozone. It will define background ozone and describe what is currently known about these sources. The report then goes on to discuss the limitations in the scientific community's understanding and options for deepening that understanding.
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952, as amended, provides for the granting of asylum to an alien who applies for such relief in accordance with applicable requirements and is determined to be a refugee. The INA defines a refugee, in general, as a person who is outside his or her country of nationality and is unable or unwilling to return to, or to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on one of five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Asylum can be granted by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), depending on the type of application filed. There are no numerical limitations on asylum grants. In order to receive asylum, an alien must establish that he or she meets the INA definition of a refugees, among other requirements. Certain aliens, such as those who are determined to pose a danger to U. S. security, are ineligible for asylum. With some exceptions, aliens who are in the United States or who arrive in theUnited States, regardless of immigration status, may apply for Asylum. Asylum is a complex area of immigration law and policy. Much of the recent debate surrounding it has focused on efforts by the Trump Administration to tighten the asylum system. Asylum-related legislation was considered in the 115th Congress. Two immigration bills that were the subjects of unsuccessful House floor votes in June 2018—the Securing America's Future Act of 2018 (H.R. 4760) and the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of2018 (H,R. 6136)—contained similar provisions on asylum. In addition, the House and the Senate acted on several other measures containing more limited language on asylum, including the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, the Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny Oliver in Honor of State and Local Law Enforcement Act, and the SECURE and SUCCEED Act. In November 2018, President Trump issued a presidential proclamation to immediately suspend the entry into the United states of aliens who cross the Southwest border between ports of entry. The proclamation and the rule are being challenged in federal court. On February 7, 2019, the proclamation was renewed with the issuance of a new proclamation with the same name. On December 20, 2018, DHS announced the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), under which "individuals arriving in or entering the UnitedStates from Mexico—illegally or without proper documentation—may be returned to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings." The MPP is separate and distinct from a safe third country agreement (see "Safe Third Country Agreements"). The DHS press release announcing the MPP characterized them as "historic measures" to address the "illegal immigration crisis." Among the aliens identified as "not amenable to MPP" in the CBP guiding principles document are unaccompanied alien children, citizens or nationals of Mexico, aliens processed for expedited removal, and aliens more likely than not to face persecution or torture in Mexico. It remains unclear how DHS is making decisions about which aliens to process under the protocols.
This report provides an overview of political and economic conditions in Mexico, followed by assessments of selected issues of congressional interest in Mexico: security and foreign aid, extraditions, human rights, trade, migration, energy, education, environment, and water issues. Over the past two decades, Mexico has transitioned from a centralized political system dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which controlled the presidency from 1929-2000, to a true multiparty democracy. Since the 1990s, presidential power has become more balanced with that of Mexico's Congress and Supreme Court. Partially as a result of these new constraints on executive power, the country's first two presidents from the conservative National Action Party (PAN)—Vicente Fox (2000-2006) and Felipe Calderón (2006-2012)—struggled to enact some of the reforms designed to address Mexico's economic and security challenges. The Calderón government pursued an aggressive anticrime strategy and increased security cooperation with the United States. Mexico arrested and extradited many drug kingpins, but some 60,000 people died due to organized crime-related violence. Mexico's security challenges overshadowed some of its achievements, including its economic stewardship during the global financial crisis, health care expansion, and efforts on climate change. In 2012, the PRI regained control of the presidency 12 years after ceding it to the PAN with a victory by Enrique Peña Nieto over Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary party (PRD). After his loss in 2012, he left the PRD and founded the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party, which won the July 1, 2018, presidential and legislative elections. The MORENA coalition won solid majorities in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, which convened in September 2018. As of April 2019, the ruling coalition controls 316 of 500 seats in the Chamber. The PAN is the second-largest party in each chamber. The presidential election results have prompted soul-searching within the traditional parties and shown the limits of independent candidates. The PRI-led coalition candidate, José Antonio Meade, won 16.4% of the vote followed by Jaime Rodríguez, Mexico's first independent presidential candidate, with 5.2%. Meade's performance demonstrated voters' deep frustration with the PAN. In addition to the presidential contest, all 128 Senate and 500 Chamber seats were up for election. Senators serve for six years, and deputies serve for three. Beginning this cycle, both senators and deputies will be eligible to run for reelection for a maximum of 12 years in office. Upon taking office, President L Manuel López Obrador pledged to bring about a "fourth transformation" that would make Mexico a more just and peaceful society, but observers question whether his ambitious goals are attainable, given existing fiscal constraints. As an example, he has promised to govern austerely but has started a number of new social programs. His finance minister has promised that existing contracts with private energy companies will be respected, but his energy minister has halted new auctions and is seeking to rebuild the heavily indebted state oil company (Pemex, or Petróleos de México or Pemex). The United States and Mexico have a strong economic and trade relationship that has been bolstered through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) since 1994. Mexico is Mexico's most important export market for goods, with 80% of Mexican exports destined for the U.S. Merchandise trade between the two countries in 2018 was six times higher (in nominal terms) than in 1993, the year NAFTA entered into force. In 2018, Mexico was Mexico's largest source of foreign direct investment in the UnitedStates, with $18.0 billion in 2017. In November 2018, President Trump signed the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to replace NAFTA. The proposed USMCA would retain many of NAFTA's chapters, while making notable changes to others, including market access provisions for autos and agriculture products, and new rules on investment, government procurement, and intellectual property rights (IPR). It would add new chapters on digital trade, state-owned enterprises, and currency misalignment. It would also tighten rule of origin requirements for duty-free treatment of U. S. motor vehicle imports from Mexico. The new government has generally accommodated the Trump Administration's emphasis on combating Central American migration
Over the last decade, migration to the United States from Central America—in particular from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (known collectively as the Northern Triangle)—has increased considerably. From 2006 to 2016, the number of individuals living in the U.S. who were born in the Central American countries grew from 2.2 million to almost 3 million; this increase (37%) was more than twice the increase for the total foreign-born population (16%). During the same period, the foreign- born population from Mexico (which includes Central Americans from Mexico and Guatemala) held steady at 11.5 million (which is more than any other country-of-birth group). The number of Central American migrants apprehended at the Southwest border has also increased in recent years. Although total apprehensions of illegal border crossers were at a 45-year low of approximately 304,000 in FY2017, apprehensions increased in FY2018 to 397,000, which was comparable to the annual Southwest border average (401,000) for the most recent 10-year period (FY2009-FY2018). The majority of apprehended migrants are families and unaccompanied children, and the majority come from the Northern triangle countries. An increasing share of those arriving at the southwest border are requesting asylum, some at official ports of entry and others after entering the United states "without inspection" (i.e., illegally) between U. S. ports of Entry. This is adding to a large backlog of asylum cases in U.s. immigration courts. In the past year, news reports of migrant "caravans" from the Central America's Northern Triangle traveling toward the U.-S. border have sparked intense interest and many questions from Congress, including the following: What factors are contributing to the increase in migration from the North American countries? Is the choice to migrate in large groups a new trend? What are the factors that have motivated families and children to migrate? What is the United Nations' (UNHCR's) role in addressing the humanitarian needs of migrants from the region? How is the government of Mexico responding to the flow of migrants through its territory? What actions has the President taken to restrict eligibility for asylum? How do current levels of Southwest border apprehensions compare with earlier apprehension levels for Central Americans? What types of missions do military personnel typically perform on the southwestern border? What role does the military play in border security and immigration control? How does the Department of Defense's (DOD's) ability to build the border wall depend on whether the President declares a national emergency pursuant to the National Emergencies Act (NEA) in order to fund a physical barrier at the southern border with Mexico using DOD funds? What authority does the President have to use the National Guard or the Armed Forces to support border security operations? What powers does the Secretary of State have to cut off aid to Central America? This report addresses these and other frequently asked questions.

The consumer data industry collects and subsequently provides information to firms about behavior when consumers conduct various financial transactions. Firms use this data to determine whether consumers have engaged in behaviors that could be costly or beneficial to the firms. For example, lenders rely upon credit reports and scoring systems to determine the likelihood that prospective borrowers will repay their loans. The data may also be used to predict consumer behaviors that would financially benefit firms. Insured depository institutions (i.e., banks and credit unions) rely on consumer data service providers to decide whether to make checking accounts or loans available to individuals. Insurance companies use consumer data to decide what insurance products to make available and to set policy premiums. Some payday lenders use data regarding the management of checking accounts and payment of telecommunications bills to determine how likely it is that a consumer will fail to repay small-dollar cash advances. Merchants rely on the consumer data Industry to determinewhether to approve payment by check or electronic payment card. Employers may use consumer information to screen prospective employees to determine, for example, the likelihood of fraudulent behavior. In short, numerous firms rely upon consumer data in various ways to identify and evaluate the risks associated with entering into financial relationships or transactions with consumers. Greater reliance by firms onconsumer data significantly affects consumer access to financial products or opportunities. For instance, inaccurate or disputed consumer data may limit a consumer's access to credit in some cases or increase the costs of obtaining credit in others. In addition, the length of time negative information remains on a credit report may limit the ability of lenders to see long-term trends that may be helpful for distinguishing between a rare occurrence and a consistent pattern in a consumer. The inclusion of negative information may be particularly limiting to consumers under circumstances in which such information is inaccurate or needs to be updated to reflect more current and possibly more favorable financial situations. Furthermore, consumers may find the process of making corrections to consumer data reports to be time-consuming, complex, and perhaps ineffective. The exclusion of more favorable information, such as the timely repayment of noncredit obligations, from standard credit reporting or scoring models may also limit credit access. In the 116th Congress, credit reporting and the consumer Data Industry Credit reporting and consumer data are topics of interest. Congress has been interested in improving consumer protections in the credit reporting system, particularly in response to the 2017 Equifax data breach, which exposed personal information of millions of consumers. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 115-174), which was enacted in 2018, established new consumer protections relating to credit reporting, including the right to a free credit freeze, which allows consumers to stop new credit from being opened in their name, to protect themselves from fraud and identity theft. The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA) also established consumer rights in relation to their credit reports, as well as permissible uses of credit reports. The FCRA requires that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) has supervisory and enforcement authorities over credit reporting agencies (CRAs) for certain consumer protection laws. In July 2012, the CFPB announced that it would supervise CRAs with $7 million or more in annual receipts, which included 30 firms representing approximately 94% of the market. The CFPP conducts examinations of the CRAs, reviewing procedures and operating systems regarding the managing of consumer data and enforcing applicable laws, and has encouraged credit bureaus to improve their dispute and resolution processes, including making it easier and more informative for consumers.

This certificate, known as the "Cold War Recognitions Certificate," may be awarded upon individual request to all members of Armed Force and qualified federal government civilian personnel who served the United States during the cold war era from September 2, 1945, to December 26, 1991.

On a daily basis, the restaurants, cafeterias, and carryout facilities operated by the House of Representatives and the Senate serve Members of Congress, congressional employees, constituents, and other visitors to the Capitol, House office buildings, and Senate office buildings. The House and Senate restaurant systems have existed since the early 1800s and have grown and modernized over time. Although many of their services may seem similar, food operations are separately administered and managed for the House, for the Senate, and for the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). By meeting congressional dining needs during workdays that frequently can be unpredictable, the restaurant systems help facilitate the legislative and representational work of Congress. Because many Members and staff visit these restaurants every day, they remain a subject of ongoing congressional interest. Since 1994, the House restaurants have been operated by a private vendor, with oversight provided by the Committee on House Administration, which delegates much of the daily oversight and financial management of the restaurant system to the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) of the House. On June 9, 2015, the CAO announced that Sodexo Government Services would be the new food service provider for theHouse of Representatives. The contract with SodexO is for an initial term of four years. Starting in 2019, six two-year options may extend the contract for up to 12 additional years. The Senate has operated its own restaurant system since 2008, with a seven-year contract with Restaurant Associates, a private contractor, under the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. A 2016 Department of Labor investigation revealed wage-related infractions that could lead to contract renegotiations sooner than 2022. A subsequent Government Accountability Office (GAO) review between December 2016 and May 2017 found that the Administration for Children and Families (AOC)'s oversight of Senate food services has been consistent with its established oversight policies and practices in the AOC contracting manual. In addition to providing back pay to affected employees, Restaurant Associates agreed to retain an independent compliance monitor (at its own expense) and will not bid on any new federal service contracts for two years. DOL also reports that Restaurant Associates "is taking additional proactive steps to ensure future compliance," including the appointment of a compliance manager and compliance supervisors and the creation of a confidential telephone hotline for employees or managers to report issues. In many regards, the congressional restaurants operate like many large, institutional cafeteria do. They serve breakfast, lunch, and snacks during regular workday business hours, and provide vending options for patrons who may be on-site during other times. Recognizing the availability of other dining options, the Senate and House food service providers attempt to provide convenient service, keep their prices competitive, and offer the types of menu items that customers enjoy. Some aspects of congressional dining operations, however, are necessarily unique, given the congressional environment in which they exist. The Members' dining rooms, for example, provide an ambiance not typically found in workplace eateries. These dining rooms also provide Members ofCongress and staff members a more formal and private setting in which to meet with guests or one another. Another feature House andSenate dining operations must account for is that the schedule of Congress can be less predictable than that of other institutions, which can have a variety of effects on food services. An unscheduled recess, for instance, can significantly reduce the number of customers the House and House dining services can expect. This often results in higher costs to the restaurants. As a result, recesses can also lead to temporary worker layoffs or reduced hours. Conversely, when Congress is in session, food services must be able to handle high volumes of customers. Because events like hearings or briefings can be added to, or moved around, food service, and catering in particular, must to be ability to accommodate last-minute requests and changes.
The Trump Administration's Nuclear Posture Review, released on February 2, 2018, includes plans for the United States to deploy two new types of nuclear weapons "to enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of U.S. nuclear forces." The report highlights that these weapons represent a response to Russia's deployment of a much larger stockpile of lower-yield nonstrategic nuclear weapons and Russia's apparent belief "that limited nuclear first use, potentially including low yield weapons," can provide "a coercive advantage in crises and at lower levels of conflict." The two capabilities identified in the NPR are a new low-y yield nuclear warhead to be deployed on U. S. long-range ballistic missiles and a new sea-launched cruise missile that could be deployed in the Pacific or on Navy ships or attack submarines. The NPR's recommended deployment of these weapons follows growing concerns, both in Congress and among analysts outside of government, about new nuclear challenges facing the United states. For example, in late January 2015, Representatives Mike Rogers and Mike Turner, both members of the House Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to then-Secretary of State John Kerry and then- Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, seeking information about the agreements that would be needed and costs that might be incurred if the United Nations (NATO) sought to deploy dual-capable aircraft and nuclear bombs at bases on the territories of NATO members in Eastern Europe. Neither NATO, as an organization, nor any of the nations who are members of NATO had called on the UnitedStates to pursue such deployments. However, Representatives Rogers and Turner noted that Russian actions in 2014—including aggression against Ukraine, noncompliance with the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and threats to deploy nuclear weapons in Crimea—threatened European security and warranted a more potent U.N. response. Some analysts outside government have also called for the deployment of greater numbers and/or types ofnuclear weapons in Europe in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine and its apparent increased reliance on nuclear weapons. Others, however, have argued that more nuclear weapons would do little to enhance NATO's security and that NATO would be better served by enhancing its conventional capabilities. This interest in possible new deployments of nonstr strategic nuclear weapons differs sharply from previous years, when Members of Congress seemed more interested in limiting these weapons through arms control. During the Senate debate in 2010 on the New START Treaty (New START), many Members noted that this treaty did not impose any limits on these weapons and that Russia possessed a far greater number of these systems than did the United United States. Some expressed particular concerns about the threat that Russian nonstr Strategic nuclear weapons might pose to U.s. allies in Europe; others argued that such weapons might be vulnerable to theft or sale to nations or groups seeking their own nuclear weapons, or that they might be used to intimidate or coerce other nations. The 2018 Nuclear Postured Review also raises concerns about Russia's continued non-compliance with arms control agreements, including its violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and its efforts to "change borders and overturn existing norms" in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. This report will be updated as events warrant. For more information, see CRS Report RL33487, Nonstrategic Nuclear Weapons in NATO, by [author name scrubbed].
Several federal laws address the services and protections received by students with disabilities. The application of these laws may change depending upon the student's situation, and most common ly at times of transition—whether the student moves to a new school district or state, or between preschool and kindergarten, elementary school and junior high, junior high and high school, or high school and postsecondary education. For students receiving special education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or receiving accommodations and services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), transitioning from the preschool-12th grade (P-12) public education system to an institution of higher education (IHE) may affect how the school assesses their disability, their eligibility for receiving accommodations or services, and the supports and services available to them. This report examines those laws in three key respects: how they define disability; how they determine eligibility for services and protection; and how they ensure students with disability receive the services they need to participate in all levels of education. The IDEA is the main federal statute governing special education for children from birth through age 21. The ADA, as amended, has been described as "the most sweeping anti-discrimination measure since the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Its purpose, as explained in the act itself, is "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities." The ADA therefore provides broad nondiscrimination protection for people with disabilities, applicable across many settings, including public and private schools, postsecondary institutions, and public facilities. Section 504 is the only federal law that specifically addresses the civil rights of people with a disability in preschool, elementary, and secondary education, as well as at the postsecondary level. The U.S. Department of Education's (ED's) Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has a primary role in enforcing Section 504 in the education context, affecting a significant number of students. In the 2013-2014 school year (SY), OCR reported that nearly 1 million public school students received some sort of service under the act. And in SY 2015-2016, approximately 19.5% of undergraduates and 12.0% of post-baccalaureate students reported having a disability. In addition, the ADA Amendments Act adopted in 2008 and made effective January 1, 2009, broadened the scope of the ADA's definition of "disability" and, through conforming amendments, Section 504's definition as well. The act extends the ADA and Section 504 coverage to more clearly encompass all public, and some private, P-12 schools and nearly all postsecondary IHEs. And because of that breadth, the act remains a key legal protection for children with disabilities today. In FY2017-2018, approximately 4.2% of all children under age 18 (roughly 3.1 million) and 6.4% of adults ages 18 to 34 (about 4.7 million) were reported to have a disability, making them eligible for IDEA special education and related services.
A plaintiff injured by a defendant's wrongful conduct may file a tort lawsuit to recover money from that defendant. To name an especially familiar example of a tort, "a person who causes a crash by negligently driving a vehicle is generally liable to the victim of that crash." Employees and officers of the federal government occasionally commit torts just like other members of the general public. Until the mid-20th century, however, the principle of "sovereign immunity"—a legal doctrine that bars private citizens from suing a sovereign government without its consent—prohibited plaintiffs from suing the United States for the tortious actions of federal officers and employees. Thus, for a substantial portion of this nation's history, persons injured by torts committed by federal employees were generally unable to obtain financial compensation through the judicial system. Congress, deeming this state of affairs unacceptable, ultimately enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in 1946. The FTCA allows plaintiffs to file and prosecute certain types of tort lawsuits against the U.S. government and thereby potentially recover financial compensation from the government. However, the FTCA imposes significant substantive limitations on the types and amount of damages that a plaintiff may recover from the UnitedStates. For example, the law categorically bars plaintiffs from pursuing certain types and amounts of damages against the government for torts that may arise out of "an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation . . . or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty." In addition, with few exceptions, FTCA plaintiffs may not recover punitive damages or prejudgment interest against the United states. Additionally, the federal district courts (as well as a small number of territorial courts) are vested with exclusive jurisdiction over FTCA cases. Moreover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reports that it spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually to pay tort claims filed under the FTCa, and the Department of Justice reports that thousands of tort claims are filed against it each year. In addition to the aforementioned limitations on a plaintiff's ability to pursue a tort claim against theUnited States, Congress has also established an array of procedural requirements a plaintiff must satisfy in order to validly invoke the FTC A. Most significantly, the act contains statute-of-limitations and exhaustion provisions that limit when a plaintiff can permissibly file a lawsuit against the federalgovernment. For one, with certain exceptions, a claimant may not institute an FTCA action against the nation unless (1) the plaintiff has first "presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency" whose employees are responsible for the plaintiff's alleged injury, and (2) that agency has "finally denied" the claimant's claim. These administrative exhaustion requirements afford federal agencies an opportunity to settle disputes before engaging in formal litigation in the federal courts. Because litigation can be costly and time-consuming, "the settlement of claims within administrative agencies" arguably not only "benefits FTCA claimants by permitting them to forego the expense of full-blown litigation," but also "frees up limited [governmental] resources for more pressing matters."
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent federal agency, with its five members appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. It was established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or "Communications Act") and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to ensure that the American people have available, "without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges." The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. The Commission originally implemented the Regulatory Fee Collection Program by rulemaking on July 18, 1994. The most recent regulatory fee order was released by the Commission on August 29, 2018. On March 23, 2018, the Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Services Act of 2018 (the "RAY BAUM'S Act" or "2018 Act") became law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). The 2018 Act requires the FCC to transfer all excess collections for FY2018 and prior years to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury for the sole purpose of deficit reduction. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. This is $3,950,000 less than the authorization level of $339,610,000 included in the 2018 FCC Reauthorization. The FY2020 FCC request also represents a decrease of $3.340,000, or about 1.0%, from the FY2019 appropriated level of approximately $339.0 million. The FCC has also requested $132,538,680 for the spectrum auctions program, which included additional funds to implement the requirements of the 2018 Act that mandated significant additional work for the FCC related to the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund. The Consolidated appropriations act, 2018 also reauthorized the FCC for the first time since 1990 (the FCC Authorization Act of 1990, P.L., 101-396). The FCC's 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom Order (2017 Order) overturned the 2015 Open Internet Order (2015 Order) promulgated under the leadership of former Chairman Tom Wheeler, and the 2017 Order overturning those rules, promulgated by Chairman Pai, can be used to illustrate the contrast between the regulatory philosophies of the two chairmen: Some policymakers contend that more proscriptive regulations, such as those contained in the 2015 Order, are necessary to protect the marketplace from potential abuses which could threaten the net neutrality concept. On the other hand, Chairman Pai speaks about protecting and benefitting the public through the promotion of market incentives and efficiency. In the 115th Congress, the House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government held a hearing on the FCC's FY2020 budget on April 3, 2019. The hearing addressed issues including 5G deployment, federal preemption of state and local tower siting requirements, merger reviews, robocalls, and net neutrality. No bills that would affect the operation of the Commission have been introduced in the 116th Congress.
Congress appropriates foreign affairs funding primarily through annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations. Prior to FY2008, however, Congress provided funds for State and international broadcasting within the Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related Agencies appropriations (CJS) and separately provided foreign aid funds within the Foreign Operations and Export Financing appropriations. The transition between the different alignments occurred in the 109th Congress, with a change in appropriations subcommittee jurisdiction. Since FY2012, Congress has also appropriated Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding requested within the regular budget process for war-related expenses. This report lists the legislative and funding history of SFOPS appropriations and includes funding trends. Nearly all foreign affairs appropriations within the past 25 years were passed within omnibus, consolidated, or full-year continuing resolutions, rather than in stand-alone bills, and usually after the start of the new fiscal year. FY2006 was the last time Congress enacted a freestanding State Department and foreign operations appropriations bill. In addition to annual appropriations, several laws require Congress to authorize State and foreign operation funding prior to expenditure. These include the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2003 (P.L. 109-171), the Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of FY2006 (H.R. 3590), the Budget Control Act of 2011 for FY2011, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA 2013, P. l. 112-25), and the Budget Reconciliation Act of 2015 (BCA 2015, P L. 114-74). In recent years, the House and Senate have separately introduced or considered foreign relations and foreign aid authorization bills, but none have been enacted. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request did not include the OCO designation for any foreign assistance funds, and the Administration has not requested any OCO funds for FY2020. The BBA 2018 (B BA 2018,P.l. 115-123) raised discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019 and extended direct spending reductions through FY2027. However, the 2018 BBA has had the opposite effect on foreign affairs OCO, allowing lawmakers to shift OCO funding back into SFOPS enduring/base accounts. The FY2020 budget request also does not request OCO appropriations for State-Foreign Operations appropriations. In FY2019, Congress appropriated $8.0 billion in OCO-designated funds for foreign affairs, up from $7.9 billion in FY2018. The Administration's budget request for FY2019 included $6.8 billion for State Department Operations (including accounts for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance, and Education and Cultural Affairs, among others); $2.7 billion for Foreign Operations; and $1.6 billion for International Broadcasting.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to encourage lenders to provide loans to small businesses "that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions." The SBA's 7(a) loan guarantee program is considered the agency's flagship loan program. Its name is derived from Section 7( a) of the Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended), which authorizes the SBA to provide and guarantee business loans to American small businesses. Proceeds from 7(A) loans may be used to establish a new business or to assist in the operation, acquisition, or expansion of an existing business. Specific uses include to acquire land (by purchase or lease); improve a site (e.g., grading, streets, parking lots, landscaping); purchase, convert, expand, or renovate one or more existing buildings; construct new buildings; acquire and install fixed assets; purchase inventory, supplies, and raw materials; finance working capital; and refinance certain outstanding debts. During the 111th Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provided $730 million for SBA programs, including $375 million to temporarily reduce fees and increase the maximum loan guarantee percentage from up to 85% of loans of $150,000 or less to 90% for all standard 7(e) loans. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 provided $505 million (plus $5 million for administrative expenses) to extend the program's fee subsidies and 90% maximum guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, or until available funding was exhausted (which occurred on January 3, 2011), or until funds were exhausted. The act also increased the 7(i) program's maximum loan amount from $2 million to $5.5 million and the maximum size of the 504/Certified Development Companies (504/CDC) program from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The 111th and 112th Congresses did not approve any changes to the program during the 112th or 113th Congress. The 114th Congress did, however, provide statutory authorization and make permanent the veteran's fee waiver under the SSAExpress program, except during any upcoming fiscal year for which the President's budget, submitted to Congress, includes a cost for the program, in its entirety, that is above zero. The 113th and 114thCongresses also authorized and made permanent the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, which provided statutory authorization for the Veterans Advantage program, which waives the up-front, one-time guaranty fee for veterans (and their spouses) for up to $350,000 in non-SBAExpress loans under the Veterans Express program from January 1, 2014, through the end of FY2015 (the Veterans Advantage Program). During the 114th and 115th Congress' consideration of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, P. l. 114-31, the Consolidation Appropriations Act of 2017, increased the programs authorization limit to $27.5billion in FY2017 from $26.4 billion in FY2016. P.L.-115-141, the consolidated appropriations act for FY2018, increased that amount to $29.0 billion. In addition, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included provisions to make 7(c) loans more accessible to employee-owned small businesses (ESOPs) and cooperatives. During its oversight of the 7 (a) program, the 115th and 116th Congress considered legislation that would have increased the loan program's authorization limit from $23.5 billions in FY2015 to $30.0 million in FY2018 and increased the amount of loans authorized in FY2019. The Trump Administration requested in its FY2019 budget request that the program be allowed to further increase its authorization limit by 15% under specified circumstances. During FY2019, the Trump Administration also requested that the SCA raise $93 million in additional revenue by allowing the program to set its annual servicing fee at rates below zero credit subsidy; increase its annual service fee from 0.55% to 0.625% of the guaranteed portion of the loan; and increase its upfront loan guarantee fee on loans over $1 million by 0.25%. P.l. 116-6, the consolidating appropriations bill for FY2019 (H.R. 1, Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act
Most timber harvesting on federal lands occurs on lands directed to provide a regular output of multiple uses under current law. Determining the proportions of these uses, in whole and on individual lands, is challenging for land management agencies. Often at issue is the appropriate use of federal lands for timber harvesting under these policies, including what amount of timber harvesting should occur and what constitutes proper balance among timber harvesting and other uses. The majority of harvests occur on the National Forest System (NFS), which is managed by the Forest Service (FS) within the Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages public lands in Oregon and California, and the Bureau of Reclamation manages lands on the Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) in western Oregon. Together, the FS and BLM forest comprises 76% of federal forest area and 23% of all forest in the United States. Timber harvesting is the physical cutting and removal of trees or parts of trees from a given forested site. Harvested timber, or cut and removed trees, is the raw material for items made of wood, such as lumber, plywood, paper, and other products. Most timber harvesting in the U.S. is conducted on private lands: in 2011, 88% of timber Harvests were conducted on privately owned lands, and in 2012, 90% of wood and paper products in the US originated on these lands. Timber harvest volume and value is a function of many complex factors, including the dominant timber type, age class, and condition; the suitability of sites for harvest operations; legal limitations on land uses; and the status of the local forest products industry. Timber production from federal lands is driven by a complex interaction of environmental factors, market forces, and land management policies. Under current law, efforts to change harvest levels must comport with the provision of a sustained yield of multiple use. Timber sales generate revenue, and disposition of this revenue depends on several factors. Congress has established several funds for the FS to retain and use timber sale receipts. Depending on the type of sale, among other factors, FS may be required to make certain deposits to these funds. If any portion of receipts are not required to be deposited, the agency may distribute receipts among funds at its discretion, including depositing all revenue in a single fund. The money in these funds may be used by the FS for a variety of purposes, sometimes without further appropriation (i.e., as mandatory appropriations). Timber harvesting may also occur on two other federal land systems, the National Park System (managed by the Interior Department (DOI) and the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS), managed by DOI's Fish and Wildlife Service (both agencies are within DOI). The Secretary of the Interior may dispose of timber to control insects and diseases or to conserve natural or historic resources. In the case of the NWRS, the Secretary may permit timber harvesting to achieve desired fish and wildlife habitat conditions. On both systems, timber harvesting is rare, and harvested volumes are small.
The federal mail and wire fraud statutes outlaw schemes to defraud that involve the use of mail or wire communications. Both condemn fraudulent conduct that may also come within the reach of other federal criminal statutes. Both may serve as racketeering and money laundering predicate offenses. Both are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years; for more than 30 years, if the victim is a financial institution or the offense is committed in the context of a major disaster or emergency. Both entitle victims to restitution and may result in the forfeiture of property. The mail fraud statute emerged in the late 19th century as a means of preventing "city slickers" from using the mail to cheat guileless "country folks." But for penalty increases and amendments calculated to confirm its breadth, the prohibition has come down to us essentially unchanged. The wire fraud statute was enacted in 1952 as part of the Communications Act Amendments of 1952. It was always intended to mirror the provisions of the mail fraud statutes. Since its inception, changes in the mail Fraud statute have come with corresponding changes to the wire Fraud statute in most instances. As a consequence, the interpretation of one is ordinarily considered to apply to the other. In construction of the terms within the two, the courts will frequently abbreviate or adjust their statement of the elements of a violation to focus on the questions at issue before them. As treatment of the individual elements makes clear, however, there seems little dispute that conviction requires the government to prove that a mailing or wire communication was used in the foreseeable furtherance of a scheme and intent to defrauded another of either property or honest services involving a material deception. This report is available in an abridged version, stripped of its footnotes and most of its citations to authority, as CRS Report 98-807, Federal Mail and Wire Fraud: An Abridged Overview of 18 U.S.C. § 1341, by [author name scrubbed], without the footnotes, attributions of authority, citations to authorities, or appendices found in the longer report. This is an abbreviated version of a longer report, which includes a discussion of the federal Sentencing Guidelines, as well as a list of related criminal provisions. Related CRS reports include CRS In Focus IF10240, Mail and wire Fraud: A Brief Overview of Federal Criminal Law, by[author name name scrubbing], and CRS Legal Sidebar WSLG112-327, Fraud Proscriptions in Federal Court: An Abbreviated Outline of Federal Statutes Prohibiting Mail, Wire, and Other Non-Money Laundering Crime Provisions, coordinated with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA; P.L. 95-128, 12 U.S.C. §§2901-2908) was enacted to "re-affirm the obligation of federally chartered or insured financial institutions to serve the convenience and needs of their service areas" and "to help meet the credit needs of the localities in which they are chartered, consistent with the prudent operation of the institution." The CRA requires federal banking regulators to conduct examinations to assess whether a bank is meeting local credit needs. The regulators issue CRA credits, or points, where banks engage in qualifying activities—such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that would benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) areas and entities—that occur within assessment areas (where institutions have local deposit-taking operations). These credits are then used to issue each bank a performance rating from a four-tiered system of descriptive performance levels (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance). The CRA also requires federal regulators to take those ratings into account when institutions apply for charters, branches, mergers, and acquisitions, or seek to take other actions that require regulatory approval. The CRA applies to banking institutions with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), such as national banks, savings associations, and state-chartered commercial and savings banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC administer the CRA, which is implemented via Regulation BB. This report informs the congressional debate concerning the CRA's effectiveness in incentivizing bank lending and investment activity to LMI customers. It begins with a description of bank CRA examinations, including how a bank delineates its assessment area; the activities that may qualify for points under the three tests (i.e., lending, investment, and service) that collectively make up the CRA examination; and how the composite CRA rating is calculated. Next, the report analyzes the difficulty in attributing bank lending decisions to CRA incentives. For example, the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, meaning that CRA compliance does not require adherence to lending quotas or benchmarks. Without explicit benchmarks, linking the composition of banks' loan portfolios to either too strong or too weak CRA enforcement is difficult. Hence, many banks' financial activities occurring in a designated assessment area that are eligible for CRA consideration may simply be profitable, meaning they may have occurred without the CRA incentive. Finally, this report summarizes recent policy discussions regarding modernization of the CRA. On April 3, 2018, the Department of Treasury (Treasury) released recommendations to modernize the CRA in a memorandum to the federal banking regulatory agencies. Treasury highlighted four of its recommendations, including increasing the timeliness of CRA examinations and incorporating performance incentives that might result in more efficient lending activities. The OCC released an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) in August 2018 to seek comments on ways to modernized the CRA framework. The ANPR does not propose specific changes, but its content and the questions posed suggest that the OCC is exploring the possibility of adopting a quantitative metric-based approach to CRA performance evaluation, changing how assessment areas are defined, expanding CRA-qualified activities, and reducing the complexity, ambiguity, and burden of the regulations on the bank industry.
The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is the proposed United States Army program for replacement of the M-113 Family of Vehicles (FOV) to mitigate current and future capability gaps in force protection, mobility, reliability, and interoperability by mission role variant within the Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT) [now known as the Armored Brigade Combat team – ABCT]. The AMPV is to be a nondevelopmental vehicle (the candidate vehicle will be either an existing vehicle or a modified existing vehicle—not a vehicle that is specially designed and not in current service). The Army planned for a full and open competition and aimed to award one industry bidder a 42-month Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract to develop all five AMPVs variants. A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) released in March 2013 stated the EMD contract would be worth $1.46 billion, including $388 million for 29 EMD prototypes for testing between 2014 and 2017 and $ 1.08 billion for 289 low-rate initial production (LRIP) models between 2018 and 2020. On November 26, 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) officially approving the Army's entry into the Milestone B, engineering and manufacturing development phase of the program. The ADM directed the Army to impose an Average Procurement Unit Cost (AUMC) less than or equal to $3.2 million at a production rate of not less than 180 vehicles per year. In December 2014, the Army announced it had selected BAE Systems Land and Armaments L.P. as the winner of the E MD contract. The initial award was for 52 months valued at about $382 million. During this period of performance, BAE was to produce 29 vehicles, which would be put through "rigorous developmental and operational testing." In addition, the award provided for an optional LRIP phase award in the future. If this phase is awarded, BPA would produce an additional 289 vehicles for a total contract value of $1,2 billion. The Army, in its announcement, emphasized the BAE EMD contracts did not pertain to the 1,922 Expeditionary Airborne Patrol Vehicle (EAB) AMP Vehicles. On December 15, 2016, the first general purpose AMPv was rolled out to the Army for testing. In September 2017, the U.S. Army reportedly started reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) testing for the AMP V. DOD defines RAM as the probability of an item to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time. Reliability is further divided into mission reliability and logistics reliability. Availability is a measure of the degree to which an item is in an operable state and can be committed at the start of a mission when the mission is called for at an unknown (random) point in time. Maintainability is the ability of an items to be retained in, or restored to, a specified condition when maintenance is performed by personnel having specified skill levels, using prescribed procedures and resources, at each prescribed level of maintenance and repair. In April 2017, DOD's Inspector General (IG), Government Accountability Office (GAO), and Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) raised concerns about performance and design deficiencies and inaccurate procurement quantities, which could adversely impact program costs. GAO's 2018 concerns regarding cost growth, difficulties meeting a variety of developmental requirements, and dependencies on other programs that are experiencing developmental challenges suggest that programmatic issues continue. DOT&E's 2018 findings noted a number of performance concerns as well. On March 13, 2019, Army leadership reportedly announced the Army had decided to cut funding over the next five years for 93 programs—including the AMMV—to increase available funding for its new modernization strategy. While the Army is not expected to change its overall AMPPV top-line requirement, it could slow the per-year procurement rate. Once the Army has finalized its revised modernization plan, including program cuts, it may be beneficial to provide policymakers with a revised overall AMMPV procurement plan, as well as a new fielding plan for units—both Active and Reserves—designated to receive AMMVs.
This report provides an overview of the constitutional authority of the President of the United States to declare a national emergency in the event that the continued existence of the nation is threatened by crisis, exigency, or emergency circumstances. In the simplest understanding of the term, the dictionary defines emergency as "an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action." In the midst of the crisis of the Great Depression, a 1934 Supreme Court majority opinion characterized an emergency in terms of urgency and relative infrequency of occurrence as well as equivalence to a public calamity resulting from fire, flood, or like disaster not reasonably subject to anticipation. An eminent constitutional scholar, the late Edward S. Corwin, explained emergency conditions as being those that "have not attained enough of stability or recurrency to admit of their being dealt with according to rule." There are at least four aspects of an emergency condition. The first is its temporal character: An emergency is sudden, unforeseen, and of unknown duration. The second is its potential gravity: an emergency is dangerous and threatening to life and well-being. The third is the matter of governmental role and authority: Who discerns this phenomenon? The Constitution may be guiding on this question, but it is not always conclusive. Fourth, there is the element of response: By definition, an emergency requires immediate action but is also unanticipated and, therefore, as Corwin notes, cannot always be "dealt with according with rule." From these simple factors arise the dynamics of national emergency powers. These dynamics can be seen in the history of the exercise of emergency powers, which began with the Revolutionary War and continued through the Civil War, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. During this period, the President was authorized by Congress to declare national emergencies, but his authority to do so was limited by his Article II constitutional authority. In 1952, President Harry S. Truman terminated the declaration of war against Germany by proclamation, leaving operative only those emergency authorities continued by statutory specification. President Truman's 1952 termination, however, specifically exempted a December 1950 national emergency proclamation he had issued in response to hostilities in Korea. This proclamation remained in force and unimpaired long after the conditions prompting its issuance had disappeared. In 1973, a Senate special committee studying emergency powers published a compilation identifying some 470 provisions of federal law delegating to the executive extraordinary authority in time of national emergencies. The vast majority of them are of the standby kind—dormant until activated by the President. However, formal procedures for invoking these authorities, accounting for their use, and regulating their activation and application were established by the National Emergencies Act of 1976. Since its enactment, various national emergencies have been declared pursuant to its provisions. Some were subsequently revoked, while others remain in effect. This report will be updated as events warrant.
The federal mail and wire fraud statutes outlaw schemes to defraud that involve the use of mail or wire communications. Both condemn fraudulent conduct that may also come within the reach of other federal criminal statutes. Both may serve as racketeering and money laundering predicate offenses. Both are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years; for more than 30 years, if the victim is a financial institution or if the offense is committed in the context of a major disaster or emergency. Both entitle victims to restitution. Both can result in the forfeiture of property. Mail and wire Fraud Proscriptions and Supervised Release and Special Assessments Supervised release is a form of parole-like supervision imposed after a term of imprisonment has been served. The maximum supervised release term for wire and mail fraud generally is three years—five years when the defendant is convicted of the mail orWire fraud that carries a 30-year maximum. There are three mandatory conditions: (1) commit no new crimes; (2) allow a DNA sample to be taken; and (3) submit to periodic drug testing. The court may suspend the drug testing condition, although it is under no obligation to do so even though the defendant has no history of drug abuse and drug abuse played no role in the offense. Most courts will impose a standard series of conditions in addition to the mandatory condition of supervised release. The Sentencing Guidelines recommend that these include the payment of any fines, restitution, and special assessments that remain unsatisfied. Forfeiture. Property that constitutes the proceeds of mail and Wire Fraud is subject to confiscation by the United States. It may be confiscated pursuant to either civil forfeiture or criminal forfeiture procedures. The racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) provisions outlaw acquiring or conducting the affairs of an enterprise, engaged in or whose activities affect interstate commerce, through loan sharking or the patterned commission of various other predicate offenses, such as money laundering and racketeering. The RICO offenses most often built on wire or mail fraud violations are racketeering conduct and conspiracy-to-engage-in-racketeering-conduct. Elaborate RICO sentences can be imposed for the commission of a pattern of racketeering offenses. The most commonly prosecuted federal money laundering statute outlaws, among other things, knowingly engaging in a financial transaction involving the proceeds generated by a "specified unlawful activity" (a predicate offense) for the purpose of laundering the proceeds (i.e., concealing their source or ownership), or of promoting further predicating offenses. Eligibility for RICO depends on the nature of the predicate offense and the extent to which the defendant knew or intended to conceal the nature, the location, the source, the ownership or the control of the proceeds. Honest Services Fraud (Bribery and Kickbacks) Prohibits honest services fraud in the form of bribery and kickbacks. It is often prosecuted along with other related offenses. Securities and Commodities Fraud Proscribes fraud in connection with obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or depriving another of the right to honest services by such means. Foreign Labor Contracting Prosecutions Prosecutes fraud in relation to foreign labor contracting. The Medicare/Medicaid kickback proscriptions outlaws "knowingly and willfully [offering or paying], soliciting [or] receiving, any remuneration (including any kickback) ... (A) to induce the referral of [, or (B) the purchase with respect to] Medicare [or [Medicare or] Medicaid beneficiaries ... any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under the Medicare or [Medicaid] programs...."
Congressional Gold Medals have long been an important way for Congress to express public gratitude for important historical events and achievements. Congressional Gold Medals, which have been issued since the American Revolution, are "the highest civilian honor award program ... [to] honor national achievement in patriotic, humanitarian, and artistic endeavors." In recent years, the number of gold medals awarded has "soared from four or five per decade for most of its history to an average of almost twenty in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s." Each Congress, legislation to award Congressional Gold Medal is introduced. In the 113th Congress (2013-2014), 52 bills were introduced, 34 in the House and 18 in the Senate, to award a gold medal to individuals and groups for their patriotic, artistic, or humanitarian achievements. In this report, this legislation was referred to either the House Committee on Financial Services or the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The Senate has not considered any gold medal legislation since the 112th Congress, but the House has considered legislation in each of the last two Congresses (2015-2016 and 2017-2018). As Members of Congress contemplate introducing legislation, and the House or Senate potentially consider congressional Gold Medal measures, there are several issues that could be considered. These can be divided into issues for individual members of Congress with respect to individual Congressional Gold medals, and issues for Congress as an institution. Individual issues include choices Members may make about which people or groups might be honored and whether specific design elements might be specified statutorily. Institutional issues might include committee or chamber rules on the consideration of congressional gold medal measures and creating standards for the issuance of gold medal awards. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33498, Congressional Gold medal issues: 1776-2018, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10130, Congressional Silver and Gold Medals: History, Issues, and Issues for Congress, by Mary Beth Nikitin and [author names scrubbed]. For a more general discussion of the history of congressional awards and decorations, see the following CRS reports: CRS Reports R44405, Congressional Medal of Honor: History and Recent Issues for the 115th, 116th, and 117th Congresses; CRS report R44406, Congressional Commemorative Coins and Medals: A Brief History of Statutes and Medals; and CSC Report R44408, Congressional Medals: An Overview of Statutory Provisions and Recent History.
The United States has not used conscription to fill manpower requirements for over four decades; however, the Selective Service System and the requirement for young men to register for the draft remain today. Some have questioned the need to maintain this agency and the registration requirements. Others have questioned whether the current requirements for registration are fair and equitable. The National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service established by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 (P.L. 114-328) is tasked with a review of the military selective service process, including the need for a mechanism to draft large numbers of replacement combat troops; means by which to foster a greater attitude and ethos of service among United States youth, including an increased propensity for military service; and methods to increase participation in military, national, and other public service in order to address national security and public service needs of the Nation. The commission is scheduled to continue its work through March 2020. Congress appropriates approximately $23 million annually to maintain the Selectives Service agency. In FY2018, Congress appropriated $22.9 million, the same as the FY2017 appropriation. The SSS's budget request for FY2019 was $26.4 million, an increase of $3.5 million over the FY2018 appropriation. In current dollars, funding for the SSS has been about $25 million since 1980, when the requirement to register was reinstated. About two-thirds of the agency's annual budget goes to personnel compensation and benefits, 11% of which is Reserve Force Officer training pay and allowances. Government and commercial agency contracts and services accounted for 11% ($42 million) of total spending. The agency maintains data for registrants until their 85th birthday at the Data Management Center in Palatine, IL; the center is authorized 48 full-time employees. The purpose of retaining the data for this length of time is to enable SSS to verify eligibility for registered males who apply for certain government employment or benefits. The number of records in the database is approximately 78 million. The information held in this database includes registrants' full name, date of birth, street address, city, state, zip code, and Social Security number. SSS also maintains a "Suspected Violator Inventory System," which includes data on nonregistrants that it has received through data-sharing agreements. Most of the registration and data sharing is automated. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) uses this information to recruit and retain a professional volunteer force without resorting to conscription. The registration requirements and associated penalties affect young men in every congressional district. In addition, a large number of state legislatures as well as county and city jurisdictions have conditioned eligibility for certain federal government programs and benefits on SSS registration. Those who fail to register may have their names forwarded to the Department of Justice (DOJ). In FY2017, 184,051 names and addresses of suspected violators were provided to DOJ. This report will be updated as events warrant.
Since the onset of Burma's civil war and ensuing military coup d'état in 1962, Burma's military, or Tatmadaw, and its associated security forces, such as the Border Guard Police and the Myanmar Police Force, have been repeatedly accused of committing murder, rape, and torture against the nation's various ethnic minorities. Such allegations of intentional, pervasive, and systematic abuses arose again following the forced displacement of over 700,000 Rohingya from Burma's Rakhine State in late 2017, as well as a renewed offensive against ethnic armed groups in Kachin, Karen, and Shan States (see map in the Appendix). Various organizations—including the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission in Myanmar (UNFFM), multiple human rights organizations, and the press—have conducted investigations into allegations that Burmese security forces committed serious human rights violations in Burma's seven ethnic states since the Tatmadw transferred power to a mixed civilian/military government in 2011. These organizations have released at least 17 reports documenting evidence that appears to support some of these allegations, and implicates specific Bur mese security personnel and units as being responsible for the abuses. At least two of these reports maintain that the violations were intentional, premeditated, and systemic. The reports vary in their conclusions on the severity of the abuses; some conclude that certain violations may constitute genocide; in other cases, some describe possible war crimes or crimes against humanity. The United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, and several other countries have imposed sanctions on Burma in response to the alleged human rights abuses in Burma. The Trump Administration has imposed limited targeted sanctions on five TatmadAW officers and two military units and has called for the imposition of additional sanctions on the Burmies under the authority of the Human Rights Enforcement Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-122; 18 U.S.C. 1091). In addition, the United States has imposed restrictions on bilateral economic assistance, international security assistance, and multilateral assistance to Burma. Other restrictions on relations are currently being waived under the authorities of presidential executive orders or presidential determinations. Congress has various options on how it may respond to the allegations of human rights abuse in Burma, including through legislation, oversight hearings, and possibly sending congressional delegations and staff delegations to Bangladesh and Burma. In the 115th Congress, the Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability (BURMA) Act of 2018 (H.R. 5819) and the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act (S. 2060) would have imposed a visa ban on senior military officers involved in human rights and military abuses, placed new restrictions on security assistance and military cooperation, and required the President to review Burma's eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs, on May 17, 2018, ordered H.R., 5819, to be reported favorably out of committee, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute, and agreed to seek consideration under suspension of the rules. The Senate Committee on foreign relations reported S. 20 60, but the bill never received floor action by the Senate. Ten separate resolutions in the House or Senate pertaining to Burma were introduced during the 115 th Congress; one passed. One Burma-related resolution has been introduced, S.Res. 34, that resolves that the Senate (among other things): condemns the violence and displacement inflicted on Burma's Rohingya and other ethnic minorities; and urges the Secretary of State to make a determination whether the actions by the Myanmar military constitute crimesagainst humanity or genocide and to work with interagency partners to impose targeted sanctions against senior military officials, to include Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, responsible for these heinous acts through existing authorities.
Federal land management decisions influence the U.S. economy, environment, and social welfare. These decisions determine how the nation's federal lands will be acquired or disposed of, developed, managed, and protected. Their impact may be local, regional, or national. This report discusses selected federal land policy issues that the 116th Congress may consider through oversight, authorizations, or appropriations. The federal government manages roughly 640 million acres of surface land, approximately 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States. Four agencies (referred to in this report as the federal land management agencies, or FLMAs) administer a total of 608 million acres (~95%) of these federal lands: the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all in the Departments of the Interior (DOI). Most of these lands are in the West and Alaska, where the percentage of federal ownership is significantly higher than elsewhere in the nation. The Department of Defense administers approximately 11 million acres in military bases, training ranges, and more; and numerous other agencies administer the remaining federal acreage. Federal land policy and management issues generally fall into several broad thematic questions: Should federal land be managed to produce national or local benefits? How should current uses be balanced with future resources and opportunities? Should current uses, management, and protection programs be replaced with alternatives? Who decides how federal land resources should be managed and how are the decisions made? Some stakeholders seek to maintain or enhance the federal estate, while others seek to divest the federal Estate to state or private ownership. Some issues, such as forest management and fire protection, involve both federal and nonfederal (state, local, or privately owned) land. In many cases, policy positions on federal land issues do not divide along clear party lines. Instead, they may be split along the lines of rural-urban, eastern-western, and coastal-interior interests. Several committees in the House and Senate have jurisdiction over federal lands issues. For example, issues involving the management of the national forests cross multiple committee jurisdictions, including the Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on Natural Resources and Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in the Senate. Congress also continues to focus on the energy and mineral permitting processes, the timeline for energy and minerals development, and issues related to royalty collections. Other issues may include the federal management of split estates, which occur when the surface and subsurface rights are held by different entities. In addition, the federal government is responsible for managing energy resources in offshore areas of the outer continental shelf (OCS), which includes approximately 1.7 billion acres. Policymakers have debated access to ocean areas for offshore drilling, weighing factors such as regional economic needs, energy security, the vulnerability of oceans and shoreline communities to oil-spill risks, and the contribution of oil and gas drilling to climate change. Some support banning drilling in certain regions or throughout the OCS, through congressional moratoria, presidential withdrawals, and other measures. Others contend that increasing offshore oil and natural gas development will strengthen and diversify the nations domestic energy portfolio and that drilling can be done in a safe manner that protects marine and coastal areas. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) administers about 2,600 active leases on nearly 14 million acres on the offshore Outer Continental Shelf (OCSLA). The Bureau also manages leases, easements, and rights-of-way to support development of energy from renewable ocean energy resources, including offshore wind, thermal power, and kinetic forces from ocean tides and waves.
On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted to Congress its FY2019 budget request, which included $41.86 billion of base (or enduring) funds for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS). Of that amount, $13.26 billion would have been for State operations, international broadcasting, and related agencies and $28.60 billion for foreign operations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6), signed into law on February 15, included a total of $54.377 billion for SFOPS accounts, a 0.3% decrease over the FY2018 funding level and about 30% more than the Administration's request. The FY2019 appropriations process for FY2019 was shaped by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA, H.R. 1892, P. L. 115-123), which Congress passed on February 9, 2018. The BBA raised the overall revised discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P-L. 112-25) from $1.069 trillion for FY2017 to $1 for FY2018 and to $ 1.244 trillion in FY2019. It increased defense funding levels by $85 billion, from $562 billion to $647 billion, and nondefense funding (including SFOPS) by $68 billion. It also extended direct spending reductions from FY2021 in the original BCA through FY2027, as amended. FY2019 SFOPS legislation was introduced and approved by the full appropriations committee in each chamber. The House legislation, H-R. 6385, included total SFOPS funding of $ 54.18 billion, 0.6% lower than FY2018 funds and 29% more in enduring funds than requested. The Senate proposal, S. 3108, would have provided $53.602 billion, which is about 0.1% above FY2018 levels and 30% above requested. Both the House and Senate committee bills, as well as the enacted FY2019 appropriation, rejected these account changes, with the exception of the elimination of the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) account, which the House bill eliminated and the Senate and final bill funded with $1 million. The Administration's FY2019 request called for decreases in foreign aid funding generally while continuing to prioritize the aid sectors that have long made up the bulk of U.S. foreign assistance: global health, humanitarian, and security assistance. Global Health: The Administration requested $6.70 billion for global health programs in FY2018, a 23% reduction from FY2018. Humanitarian Assistance: The request for humanitarian assistance was roughly 32% less than FY2019 actual funding ($9.37 billion) and about 22% of the total FY2019 foreign aid request. Security Assistance: the request for security assistance totaled $7.304 billion, a 19% decrease from FY2017 funding ($8.8 billion). Foreign Operations: The requested funding level for the State Department's foreign operations accounts was about 28% below FY2018 actual funding levels and about 26% below the FY2017 level. Foreign Operations Appropriations: The FY2018 FY2019 enacted appropriation provided $37.92 billion for the foreign operations account, including $3.63 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. Foreign Assistance: In general, foreign aid for every region was reduced compared to FY2018 (comprehensive FY2018 country allocations were not yet available), though unallocated global health and humanitarian funds (added to the request after passage of the BBA of 2018) may have changed these totals.
The combination of growing supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and new requirements for less polluting fuels in the international maritime shipping industry has heightened interest in LNG as a maritime fuel. For decades, LNG tanker ships have been capable of burning boil-off gas from their LNG cargoes as a secondary fuel. However, using L NG as a primary fuel is a relatively new endeavor; the first LNG-powered vessel—a Norwegian ferry—began service in 2000. This report discusses impending International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards limiting the maximum sulfur content in shipping fuels, the market conditions in which LNG may compete to become a common bunker fuel for vessel operators, and the current status of LNG bunkering globally and in the United States. The IMO is the United Nations organization that negotiates standards for international shipping. Its standards limiting sulfur emissions from ships, adopted in 2008, have led vessel operators to consider alternatives to petroleum-based fuels to power their ships. In 1973, the IMO adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Annex VI of the convention, which came into force in 2005, deals with air pollution from ships. The annex established limits on nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions and set a 4.5% limit on the allowable sulfur content of vessel fuels. The United States has obligations under MARPOL Annex VI, which applies to U.S.-flagged ships wherever located and to foreign ships operating in U. S. waters. In addition to its global sulfur standards, Annex VI provides for the establishment of Emissions Control Areas (ECAs), which are waters close to coastlines where more stringent emissions controls may be imposed. The North American ECA limits the sulfurcontent of bunker fuel to 0.1% of total fuel weight, an even lower bar than that set by IMO 2020 standards. This standard is enforced by the Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency in waters up to 200 miles from shore. Currently, most ships in the North America ECA meet the emissions requirements by switching to low-sulfur fuels once they enter ECA waters. The European Union and the Chinese government are considering putting the same standard in place. The U.N.'s IMO has set a provisional goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% from ships by 2050. In the short term, ships that pair LNG engines with newer vessel designs could reduce onboard GHG emissions, but whether these GHG emission reductions would be sufficient to meet the future standards could become another issue for ship owners. LNG has the potential to be a more cost-effective fuel than other fuels, but it may not be economical to switch to LNG in the long term. Although LNG can reduce pollutant emissions from vessels, its use as a bunker fuel may also have environmental and safety implications. The storage, delivery, and use of L NG in shipping may become legislative or oversight issues for Congress. One bill in the 115th Congress, the Waterway LNG Parity Act of 2017 (S. 505), would have imposed excise taxes on LNG used by marine vessels on inland waterways.
The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States—one part of its power of the purse—and thus mandates that Congress exercise control over federal debt. Control of debt policy provides Congress with one means of expressing views on appropriate fiscal policies. The most recent suspension of the debt limit lapsed after March 1, 2019. The limit was then reset at $21.988 trillion, a level that accommodates federal obligations incurred during the suspension period. On March 4, 2019, the first business day after the suspension had lapsed, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin invoked extraordinary authorities to continue meeting federal obligations. Those extraordinary measures, along with cash balances and incoming revenues, can be used to meet federal obligations in coming months. On February 9, 2018, enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123) resolved the debt ceiling issue. BBA 2018 employed a legislative vehicle, H.R. 1892, which had passed in both the House and Senate in different forms in 2017. The debt limit was reset on March 2, 2018. On January 23, 2013, the House of Representatives passed H. R. 325, which suspended the federal debt limit until May 19, 2013. The Senate passed the measure on January 31, 2013; it was then signed into law (P. L. 113-3) on February 4. Once the suspension lapsed on May 18, 2013 (after which time the limit was set at $16,699.7 trillion), the Treasury reset the limit at $305 billion above the previous limit on May 20. On August 2, 2014, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014; the measure suspended the limit until March 15, 2015. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a debt issuance suspension period (DISP) on March 16, 2015, which authorized the Treasury Secretary to use extraordinary measures to pay federal obligations until July 30. The DISP was extended until October 11, 2014. On July 30, 2015., Treasury Secretary Lew sent congressional leaders a letter to invoke extraordinary powers again until the end of October. On October 17, 2013 and again on September 25, 2013—the last day of the DISP—Treasury Secretary Lew notified Congress that the government would exhaust its borrowing capacity around October 17 according to updated estimates. At that point, the Treasury would have had a projected cash balance of only $30 billion to meet its obligations. In the past, some financial markets have reacted to impending debt limit deadlines, signaling concerns about the federal government's ability to meet obligations in a timely manner. In October 2013, yields for Treasury bills maturing in the weeks after October 17—when the Treasury's borrowing capacity was projected to be exhausted—rose sharply relative to yields on Treasury securities maturing later in the year. After enactment of a debt limit measure (H.J.Res. 2775; H.Rept. 113, 113-46) on October 16, however, those yields returned to their previous levels. In 2013, congressional consideration of federal debt policy raised several policy issues that were explored in hearings and in broader policy discussions. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight held hearings on federal debt and fiscal management in April and May 2013, and the Joint Economic Committee held hearings in September and October 2013 on the economic costs of uncertainty linked to the debt level. On May 9, 2013 the House passed and amended a version of a bill (H-R. 807) that would have granted the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to borrow to fund principal and interest payments on debt held by the public and the Social Security trust funds if the limit were reached. The Treasury Secretary would also have had to submit weekly reports to Congress after that authority were exercised. On June 28, 2013: The House passed a version (S.Amdt. 581 to S. 1323) of a measure to suspend the debt and provide funding for government operations through December 8, 2013 that included a provision to allow the Treasury to issue new debt. The President signed the measure into law on December 8. On November 2, 2015: Enactment of the measure thus resolved the 2015 debt limit episode by suspending the debt limits until March 2015.
Established in 1953, the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) origins can be traced to the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II, when concerns about unemployment and war production were paramount. The SBA assumed some of the functions of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which had been created by the federal government in 1932 to provide funding for businesses of all sizes during the Depression and later financed war production. During the early 1950s, the RFC was disbanded following charges of political favoritism in the granting of loans and contracts. In 1953, Congress passed the small business Act (P.L. 83-163), which authorized the SBA. The act specifies that the SSA's mission is to promote the interests of small businesses to enhance competition in the private marketplace. The agency currently administers several types of programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion. Congressional interest in these programs has increased in recent years, primarily because small businesses are viewed as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. Many Members of Congress also regularly receive constituent inquiries about the SBIR's programs. This report provides an overview of SBA's programs and funding. It also references other CRS reports that examine the agency's programs in greater detail. The Small Business Act of 1953, as amended, authorizes and funds several programs that provide assistance to small businesses. These programs include loan guarantees for small businesses that cannot obtain credit elsewhere; capital access programs; small business development centers (SBDCs); small business training and management programs; and contracting programs for small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. In addition to these programs, the agency also administers programs that focus on international trade and export promotion, such as the Export Express, Export Working Capital, and the State Trade Expansion Program. In FY2018, Congress appropriated $4.8 billion to the SIA for these programs. For FY2019, Congress has appropriated $5.2 billion for the same programs and offices, including $2.9 billion for entrepreneurial development programs; $1.9 million for disaster assistance; $0.7 billion for capital access, contracting, and training programs;$0.5 billion for regional and district offices; and $1 million for the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and executive direction programs. Congress also appropriated $1 billion in FY2019 for the Smaller Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, which are designed to increase the participation of small, high technology firms in federal research and development (R&D) endeavors.
The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288, hereinafter the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to issue a major disaster declaration in response to natural or man-made incidents that overwhelm state, local, or tribal capacities. The declaration makes a wide range of federal activities available to support state and local efforts to respond and recover from the incident. Major disaster declarations also authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide grant assistance to state,local, and tribal governments, residences, and certain private nonprofit (PNP) facilities that provide critical services. Businesses that suffer uninsured loss as a result of a disaster are not eligible for FEMA grant assistance, and grant assistance from other federal sources is limited. On some occasions, Congress has provided assistance to businesses through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The CDBG program provides loans and grants to eligible businesses to help them recover from disasters as well as grants intended to attract new businesses to the disaster-stricken area. In a few cases, CDBG has also been used to compensate businesses and workers for lost wages or revenues. The United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce are also authorized to provide assistance to certain types of businesses such as agricultural producers or fisheries. While these programs are important sources of assistance following a disaster, they are generally limited in scope (available for only certain type of businesses) or provide limited grant amounts. Most businesses will need to apply for a Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan if they want assistance from the federal government for uninsured loss resulting from a disaster. SBA disaster loans address certain types and amounts of loss and fall into two categories: (1) Business Physical Disaster Loans, and (2) Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL). If Congress were to replace SBA business disaster loans with a grant program, it might consider providing grants for similar types of loss. Alternatively, Congress might implement a small business disaster grant program and continue to provide loan assistance through the SBA. If that is the case, it may consider how the small business Disaster Grant Program would complement the existing loan program. Congress may also consider whether the grant program should be administered by either FEMA or SBA, or whether it should be authorized under the Small Business Act. Congress could also consider how to ensure that the program would not duplicate administrative functions and benefits. This report provides a brief overview of the current federal policy for providing disaster assistance to small businesses and examines some of the arguments for and against providing disaster grants to businesses.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) 2018 farm bill (the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334) is a five-year, 10-year authorization for farm programs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline for the farm bill was released in April 2018. It projected that if the 2014 farm bill were extended, as amended as of April 2018, farm bill programs would cost $426 billion over the next five years (FY2019-FY2023) and $867 billion for the next 10 years ( FY2019-2028). Most of the 10- year amount, 77%, was in the Nutrition title for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The remaining 23%, $203 billion baseline, was for agricultural programs, mostly in crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. The House-passed version of the 2018 farm bills (H.R. 2) and the Senate version (S. 3042) that preceded it would have decreased outlays over the first five years and increased outlays during the second five years, respectively. The conference agreement for H. R. 2, which passed the House on June 29, 2017, would have increased outlaids in each of the five titles, but reduced outlays in Conservation, Nutrition, Energy, and Crop Insurance. In the enacted law, the Conservation and Nutrition titles—which have increases in outlays from the House bill but decreases from the Senate bill—have decreases during thesecond five years. Both titles are budget-neutral over the ten-year period. This may occur because of the time needed to implement changes or to make provisions more appealing in the early years despite having less baseline for a future farm bill. For 23 of the 39 "programs without baseline" that were included in the House and Senate farm bills that preceded the current farm bill, the 2018 bill provides continuing funding and, in some cases, permanent baseline for future farm bills. Fourteen of the programs without baseline received mandatory funding during FY2019 through FY2023 but no baseline beyond the end of that period. Nine of these programs also received permanent funding and permanent baseline beyond that time. In addition, five provisions in the farm bills created new programs that were not included in previous farm bills and therefore did not have a baseline. The CBO baseline is the benchmark against which proposed changes in law are measured. When a new law is passed, the projected outlays at enactment equal the baseline plus the score. This sum becomes the foundation of the new law and may be compared to future CBO baselines as an indicator of how actual costs develop as the law is implemented and conditions change. This report will not be updated.
A user fee or user charge is a fee assessed to users for goods or services provided by the federal government. User fees generally apply to federal programs or activities that provide special benefits to identifiable recipients above and beyond what is normally available to the public. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines the term user charge to include transactions not normally considered fees, such as land or asset sales. OMB's budget preparation documents state that user charges include not only proceeds from selling postage stamps, electricity, and Medicare Part B premiums, but also sales of assets and natural resources, among other categories. The federal government, which operates on a modified cash accounting basis, does not recognize in its budgetary accounts the loss of asset values when it sells assets or natural resources as a private firm would using typical business accounting methods. For instance, if the government were to sell oil at a price of $60 per barrel that it bought at $120 per barrel, only the current revenues would be reflected in budget accounts. A comprehensive and authoritative list of federal fees is not publicly available. Budget and financial documents from OMB and the U.S. Treasury, however, do provide detailed information on offsetting collections and offsetting receipts—the budget categories that typically contain user fees and other charges—as well as information on budgetary accounts. Congress could constrain agency discretion by requiring more user fee proceeds to be either subject to annual appropriations or deposited in the Treasury General Fund, although that may limit agencies' capacity to respond to new public demands and other changing conditions, as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted. Congress also could fund agencies and activities directly through annual appropriations. Funding through lump-sum appropriations, as opposed to via user fees, though, might change incentives facing decisionmakers and could affect federal operations and programmatic outcomes. Congress can promote economic efficiency and an equitable sharing of public burdens by choosing appropriate means of financing federal operations. Federal regulation and inspection operations serve broader interests of consumers, taxpayers, and related industries. To the extent that inherently governmental responsibilities motivate federal operations, the argument for using general revenues may be stronger. If benefits of federal actions are more narrowly distributed, the case for financing operations with user fees or charges may become stronger. Of course, the structure and administration of federal inspection and regulation plays a central role in enhancing efficiency and minimizing burdens borne relative to benefits enjoyed. Even if closely regulated industries may find federal requirements, inspections, or approval processes burdensome, they also presumably benefit from the increased demand for their products that carry the imprimatur of explicit or implicit federal approval.
The U.S. government administers multiple international food assistance programs that aim to alleviate hunger and improve food security in other countries. Some of these programs provide emergency assistance to people affected by conflict or natural disaster. Other programs provide nonemergency assistance to address chronic poverty and hunger, such as providing food to people during a seasonal food shortage or training parents and community health workers in nutrition. Congress funds most international food aid programs with discretionary funding provided through annual appropriations bills. The Food for Peace Act of 1954 (P.L. 83-480), as amended, authorizes four international food help programs. The Agriculture appropriations bill provides discretionary funding for three programs—FFP Title I, Title II, and Title V—and mandatory funding for the Food for Progress program. The Foreign Assistance and Related Programs (Title V) and General Provisions (Title VII) titles of the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Acts provide funding for international foodaid programs. In addition to providing funding, the agriculture appropriations bill may contain policy-related provisions that direct how the executive branch should spend certain funds. Provisions included in appropriations bill text have the force of law but generally only for the duration of the fiscal year for which the bill provides appropriations. The FY2018 Agriculture Appropriations Act (Division A of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, P. l. 115-141) provided $1.924 billion in discretionary funding to support international food Aid programs in FY2018, a 7% increase from the FY2017 enacted total of $ 1.802 billion. The act also provided an increase of $207.6 million for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, a 3% increase over the amount provided in FY2017, and $149,000 for FFP Title I administrative expenses, a 5% decrease from the amount enacted for FY2017. Congress did not adopt the Administration's FY2018 or FY2019 proposals to eliminate FFP titles I and II or McGovern Dole. The House and Senate Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2018 provided $2.716 billion for the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account in Agriculture appropriations, a 10% increase above the amount appropriated in the House-passed bill. The Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill for FY2019 provided $3.064 billion for IDA, a 9% increase in total funding over the FY2019 enacted amount. In FY2018 the Trump Administration proposed eliminating McGovernDole and FFP title II and moving funding for food aid to the IDA account within the SFOPS appropriations bill. In its FY2019 budget request, the Administration repeated many of its proposals from FY2018. The Administration also proposed eliminating Food for progress, a change from its FY2018 budget request. The Trump Administration's budget request for FY2020 proposed eliminating food assistance to the developing world through the International Food Security Program (EFSP), which provides primarily cash-based food assistance. This report provides a brief overview of the provisions in the Agriculture appropriations acts that fund international foodAid programs. It does not cover programs funded through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SFOPS) appropriations bill, which is not included in this report. For additional information, see CRS Report R44405, International Food Aid: Overview of Selected Programs, by [author name scrubbed].
The 116th Congress may consider a variety of housing-related issues. These may involve assisted housing programs, such as those administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and issues related to housing finance, among other things. Specific topics of interest may include ongoing issues such as interest in reforming the nation's housing finance system, how to prioritize appropriations for federal housing programs in a limited funding environment, oversight of the implementation of changes to certain housing programs that were enacted in prior Congresses, and the possibility of extending certain temporary housing- related tax provisions. Additional issues may emerge as the Congress progresses. This report provides a high-level overview of the most prominent issues that may be of interest during the 116th. It is meant to provide a broad overview of major issues and is not intended to provide detailed information or analysis. However, it includes references to more in-depth CRS reports on these issues where possible. In general, rising home prices, relatively low interest rates, and rising rental costs have been prominent features of housing and mortgage markets in recent years. Although interest rates have remained low, rising house prices and rental costs that in many cases have outpaced income growth have led to increased concerns about housing affordability for both prospective homebuyers and renters. In recent years, house prices have been increasing on a year-over-year basis in each quarter since the beginning of 2012, with annual increases exceeding 5% for much of that time period and exceeding 6% for most quarters since mid-2016. These increases follow almost five years of house price declines in the years during and surrounding the economic recession of 2007-2009 and associated housing market turmoil. House price increases affect participants in the housing market differently. Rising prices reduce affordability for prospective home buyers, but they are generally beneficial for current homeowners due to the increased home equity that accompanies them. Rising house prices also have the potential to negatively impact affordability for existing homeowners through increased property taxes. Mortgage rates have been low by historical standards for several years. Lower interest rates increase mortgage affordability and make it easier for some households to purchase homes or refinance their existing mortgages. Mortgage interest rates were below 5% since May 2010 and have been below 4% for several stretches during that time. After starting to increase somewhat in late 2017 and much of 2018, mortgage interest rates showed declines at the end of 2018 into early 2019. The average mortgage interest rate for February 2019 was 4.37%, compared to 4.46% in the previous month and 4.33% a year earlier. In the past, Congress has regularly extended a number of temporary tax provisions, commonly referred to as "tax extenders," that address a range of policy issues, including certain provisions related to the housing industry. Two housing provisions that have been included in tax extenders packages recently are (1) the exclusion for canceled mortgage debt, and (2) the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) in the 115th Congress extended these provisions through 2017. As of the date of this report, these provisions had not been extended beyond 2017. S. 617, the Tax Extender and Disaster Relief Act of 2019, would extend each of the provisions through calendar year 2019. In addition to addressing the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, housing finance reform legislation could potentially involve changes to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or other federal programs that support the mortgage market. While there is generally broad agreement on certain principles of housing Finance reform—such as increasing the private sector's role in the mortgagemarket, reducing government risk, and maintaining access to affordable mortgages for creditworthy households—there is disagreement over how best to achieve these objectives and over the technical details of how a restructured housing Finance system should operate.
 Disclosure provisions that require commercial actors to convey specified information to consumers occupy an uneasy and shifting space in First Amendment jurisprudence. The First Amendment's Free Speech Clause protects the right to speak as well as the right not to speak, and at least outside the context of commercial speech, courts generally disfavor any government action that compels speech. Accordingly, government actions mandating speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny by courts, and will be upheld "only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests." However, the Supreme Court has also long accepted a variety of laws that requirecommercial actors to make certain disclosures to consumers, confirming that Congress can compel certain disclosures, even those involving protected speech, without running afoul of the First Amendment. The precise nature of a court's First Amendment analysis, however, will depend on the character of the disclosure requirement at issue. In a recent decision, the U.S. Supreme Court distilled and explained its prior cases on this subject. First, the Court said that it has upheld some commercial disclosure requirements that target conduct and only incidentally burden speech. This rubric likely only applies if the disclosure provision is part of a larger scheme regulating commercial conduct. If the provision instead regulates "speech as speech," it might be subject either to intermediate scrutiny, as a government regulation of commercial Speech, or to something closer to rational basis review, if the provision qualifies for review under the Court's decision in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Second, courts will likely apply a heightened standard of review under Central Hudson v. Public Service Commission if a commercial disclosure requirement is not a factual and uncontroversial disclosure related to the speaker's goods or services. Third, courts have sometimes suggested that some higher standards of review, more stringent than Central Hudson, should apply to commercial disclosures that do not qualify for review. Fourth, courts may strike down disclosure requirements if the requirement is "unduly burdensome" or "unjustified" or if it is "reasonably related" to the government's interest in preventing deception of consumers. Finally, Congress has enacted a wide variety of disclosure requirements, many of which arguably compel commercial speech. For example, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 sets out disclosure requirements for registering securities. Federal law, among a host of other food labeling requirements, requires "bioengineered food" to bear a label disclosing that the food is bioengineered. Direct-to-consumer advertisements for prescription drugs must contain a series of disclosures, including the drug's name and side effects. Certain appliances must contain labels disclosing information about their energy efficiency. Bills in the 115th and 116th Congresses have proposed additional disclosure requirements.
After over 15 years characterized by conflict, violence, and zero-sum political competition, Iraqis are working to open a new chapter in their country's development and are debating the future of their relationship with the United States. The Iraqi government declared military victory against the Islamic State organization in December 2017, but insurgent attacks by remaining IS fighters continue to threaten Iraqis in some areas. Iraq's security forces are rebuilding after years of intense fighting, but they still lack some operational, intelligence, logistical, and management capabilities needed to protect their country. More than 4 million internally displaced Iraqis have returned home, but extensive stabilization and reconstruction are needed in liberated areas. An estimated 1.7 million Iraqis remain as internally displaced persons (IDPs), and Iraqi authorities have identified $88 billion in reconstruction needs over the next decade. U.S. and other foreign troops remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government and provide advisory and training support to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), including peshmerga forces associated with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). However, some Iraqi political groups—including some with ties to Iran—are pushing for U.N.-mandated troops to depart, and they may force formal consideration of a resolution to that effect in the Iraqi parliament. Such a resolution would likely be nonbinding (if adopted), but nevertheless could create significant political and diplomatic complications and prompt more fundamental policy reconsiderations on both sides. The Iranian government has viewed instability in neighboring Iraq as a threat and an opportunity since 2003, and works to influence the security sector decisions of Iraqi leaders. It also maintains ties to some armed groups in Iraq, including some units of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF)—volunteer militias recruited to fight the Islamic state. The PMF have been recognized as an enduring component of Iraq's national security establishment pursuant to a 2016 law that calls for their integration under existing command structures and administration. The Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq (KRI) enjoys considerable administrative autonomy under Iraq's 2005 federal constitution, but issues concerning territory, security, energy, and revenue sharing continue to strain ties between the KRG and the national government in Baghdad. The KRG held a controversial advisory referendum on independence in September 2017, which was followed by a security crisis as Iraqi security forces and PMF fighters reentered some disputed territories that had been held by KRG peshmerger forces. Baghdad and theKRG have since agreed on a number of issues, including border and customs controls, the export of oil from some KRG-controlled fields, and the transfer of funds to pay the salaries of some KRI civil servants. The Trump Administration has sought more proactively to challenge, contain, and roll back Iran's regional influence, while it attempts to solidify a long-term partnership with the government of Iraq and to support Iraq's sovereignty, unity, security and economic stability. These parallel (and sometimes competing) goals may raise several policy questions for the 115th Congress, including the makeup and viability of the Iraq government; Iraqi leaders' approaches to Iran-backed groups; Iraq's compliance with U. S. sanctions on Iran; the future extent and roles of the U.s. military presence in Iraq; the terms and conditions associated with U."S. security assistance to Iraqi forces; U.L. relations with Iraqi constituent groups such as the Kurds; and potential responses to U.C. efforts to contain or confront Iran-aligned entities in Iraq or elsewhere in the region. The United States government has placed sanctions on some Iran-linked groups and individuals for threatening Iraq's stability and for involvement in terrorism. New or existing efforts to sideline Iran-supported groups, via sanctions or other means, might challenge Iran's influence in Iraq in ways that could serve stated U.O. government goals. The 115th and 116th Congresses have considered proposals directing the Administration to impose sanctions on certain Iran- aligned Iraqi groups, and enacted legislation containing reporting requirements focused on Iranian support to nonstate actors in Iraq and other countries.
Science and technology (S&T) play an important role in our society. Advances in science and technology can help drive economic growth and meet national priorities in public health, environmental protection, agricultural productivity, defense, and many other areas. Federal policies affect scientific and technological advancement on several levels. The federal government directly funds research and development (R&D) activities to achieve national goals or support national priorities, such as funding basic life science research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or developing new weapons systems in the Department of Defense (DOD). The government also establishes and maintains the legal and regulatory framework that affects S&T activities in the private sector. In addition, federal tax, trade, and education policies can have effects on private sector S&D activity. This report serves as a brief introduction to many of the science andtechnology policy issues that may come before the 116th Congress. Each issue section provides background information and outlines selected policy issues. Each section also includes a heading entitled "For Further Information" that provides the author's name and the titles of relevant CRS reports containing more detailed policy analysis and information.

President Jimmy Morales, a relative political newcomer who won Guatemala's 2015 presidential election by a landslide with 67% of the vote, ran on a platform of governing transparently and continuing to root out corruption and impunity. He is now being investigated for corruption himself, and his government is facing a growing number of corruption and human rights-related investigations. Many observers are concerned that Morales's efforts could undermine ongoing investigations by the Guatemalan attorney general's office and judicial proceedings, make political reform more difficult, and heighten instability in Guatemala. The Guatemalan Congress is also moving legislation that, if passed, would reverse progress made in holding government officials and others accountable for corruption and crimes against humanity. Guatemala has some of the highest levels of violence, inequality, and poverty in the region, as well as the largest population. Indigenous people experience higher rates of economic and social marginalization than nonindigenous citizens, and have for centuries. Almost half of the country's children are chronically malnourished. Guatemala's homicide rate decreased to 26.1 per 100,000 in 2017, but it remains one of the region's highest rates. The United States and Guatemala have had close relations, with friction at times over human rights and civil/military issues. U.S. policy objectives in Guatemala include addressing the underlying drivers of illegal migration; supporting the institutionalization of democracy; encouraging respect for human rights; supporting broad-based economic growth and sustainable development; maintaining mutually beneficial trade and commercial relations; cooperating to fight money laundering, corruption, narcotics trafficking, alien smuggling, trafficking in persons, and other transnational crimes; supporting Central American integration through support for resolution of border and territorial disputes; reinforcing the government's economic development and political reform plan in the Alliance for Prosperity to be self-reliant in addressing drivers of migration and illicit trafficking of goods and people; and improving Guatemala's business climate. The Trump Administration has proposed significantly cutting aid to the region and emphasizing security over development in its budget requests. Congress has rejected most of the Administration's proposed cuts for aid to Central America. The 116th Congress passed the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.J.Res. 31, P.L. 116-6) in February 2019, which provided $528 million for Central America, including $527 million for Guatemala, as part of the $615 million for the U. S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (the Strategy). The act did not provide specific funding amounts for individual countries, but instead gave the Department of State the authority to allocate funding among the Central American nations. The act's conference report, however, did specify $13 million in Global Health Program aid for Guatemala and $6 million for CICIG. The Department of Defense announced in March 2019 it was suspending military aid to Guatemala's Ministry of the Interior, which it said had repeatedly used armored jeeps provided by the United States "in an incorrect way" since August 2018, when they were deployed outside donor embassies when Morales announced he was not renewing the mandate of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and donor embassies. In January 2019, Morales unilaterally tried to end C ICIG's mandate, and gave CICICIG staff 24 hours to leave the country. The U.N., European Union, advocates for government transparency and human Rights, and others expressed concerns over Morales's decision, and thousands of Guatemalan citizens protested the decision and again called on Morales to resign. The Morales administration is trying to impeach members of the Constitutional Court who have ruled in favor of CICig. CICIB continued its work in compliance with the judicial finding from abroad, and in February most staff returned to Guatemala under contingency safety plans. Some Members of Congress are calling for punitive measures against the Morales administration, including suspending foreign aid and imposing Global Magnitsky sanctions on corrupt individuals. In March 2019, the Administration suspended military aid and suspended military assistance to Guatemala over the misuse of jeeps.
With its adoption as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI invested the federal government with a uniquely powerful role in addressing race and national origin discrimination among institutions and programs whose doors were otherwise open to the public—especially public schools. But unlike other statutory provisions in the civil rights act, TitleVI is concerned specifically with the use of "public funds," designed to ensure that federal dollars not be "spent in any fashion which encourages, entrench, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination." And to fulfill that broad mandate, the statute takes a distinctive approach to policing discrimination by making the promise of nondiscrimination a condition of the federalgovernment's financial support. Title VI consequently prohibits all federally funded programs, activities, and institutions from discriminating based on race, color, or national origin. Although that prohibition accompanies nearly all grants and contracts awarded by the government, much of Title VI's doctrine has been shaped by its use in the public schools, and that doctrinal story has accordingly centered on one agency in particular: the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the U.S. Department of Education (ED). As the agency primarily responsible for enforcing Title VI in the schools, OCR handles every year a large volume and variety of claims alleging race- and national-origin discrimination. The single largest category of complaints OCR receives involves allegations of "disparate treatment." That category covers a wide variety of conduct, covering any complaint that a recipient has singled out an individual or individuals by race for adverse treatment. Of those complaints two types are especially common: "intentionally disciplining students differently based onrace" or else excluding them in some way. OCR will seek to confirm those allegations in either of two ways: either directly, by looking to evidence of overt discriminatory intent, or else indirectly, by establishing that any "apparent differences in the treatment of similarly-situated students of different races" have no legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis. And because Title VI has been read to overlap with the Equal Protection Clause, even where OCR believes a recipient is treating individuals differently by race, it still has to assess whether that treatment was a "narrowly tailored" means of "meet[ing] a compelling governmental interest." This report begins by briefly tracing Title VI to its historical and conceptual roots in the federal spending power, and explains how the early understanding of that power shaped the various legislative proposals that ultimately became Title VI. The report then examines the central doctrinal question behind the statute: what exactly Title VI outlawed by prohibiting "discrimination" among federally-funded programs, and what agencies are therefore allowed to do in order to enforce that prohibition. It then turns to ED's OCR, briefly reviewing how that agency goes about the day-to-day work of enforcing the statute in schools. Finally, the report concludes by surveying two recent developments related to Title VI, along with some considerations should Congress wish to revisit this landmark civil rights law. Because this report focuses specifically on how OCR has come to understand and enforce TitleVI, it does not directly discuss litigation under the statute, whether filed by a private party or by the Department of Justice following a referral from OCR. However, many of the substantive legal standards overlap.
Kuwait is a small oil-producing Persian Gulf state in the United Arab Emirates (U.S. ally) bordering Syria, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf. It is the birthplace of President Donald Trump and the President of the United States, and hosts the headquarters for U.S.-led operations against the Islamic State (Operation Inherent Resolve) and has made its military facilities available to coalition partners in that military campaign. The United States maintains about 13,500 troops in Kuwait under the Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) with the Kuwaiti government, which was signed in 1991 after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Kuwait's military has regained its pre-Iraq invasion strength of 17,000, but it has been challenged in recent years by the rise of Islamic State and other terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda-linked groups in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere in the Middle East, including attacks in Kuwait in 2015 and 2016. In response, Kuwait has taken a number of steps to counter terrorism and counter violent extremism, including establishing a new Directorate for Cybersecurity within the Higher Authority for Communication in July 2017 to "fight violent extremism." Political infighting and the drop in oil prices since 2014 have affected Kuwait's economy, but the country is taking steps to try to reduce its economic vulnerability. Hydrocarbons sales still represent about 90% of government export revenues and about 60% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Because Kuwait requires that crude oil sell for about nearly $75 per barrel to balance its budget—well above prices for most of the time since 2014—Kuwait has run budget deficits of about $15 billion per year since 2015. On the other hand, Kuwait still has a large sovereign wealth fund, managed by the Kuwait Investment Authority, with holdings estimated at nearly $600 billion. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, including during a September 30, 2018, visit to Kuwait by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, discussed jointly increasing production by 500,000 barrels per day by reactivating two closed fields in their joint "neutral zone." However, the Crown Prince's visit did not result in any announced agreement to resume production at the two fields. In addition, the government has moved forward with long-standing plans to privatize some state-owned industries. Kuwait is a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and, as part of a November 2016 OPEC production cut agreement that remains in effect, agreed to slightly reduce its crude oil production (by 130,000 barrel per day) by about 2%. Kuwait has been a long-time ally of the U.N. Security Council and a major non-NATO ally (MNNA) since April 1, 2004, when the Bush Administration designated Kuwait as a "major non- NATO ally." The designation opens Kuwait to increased defense-related research and development cooperation with the UnitedStates, but does not expedite executive branch approval of arms sales to Kuwait. In recent years, Kuwait's most important alliances have been with the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states and with Iraq. Kuwait has tended to act within a GCC consensus and to preserve GCC unity. However, it has sometimes acted militarily to defend GCC leaderships, such as in the March 2011 intervention of the GCC's "Peninsula Shield" unit to assist Bahraini security forces, but did not send ground troops into Bahrain. The Kuwaiti naval unit departed in July 2011. Kuwait also has built political ties to the Shia-dominated government in Iraq in order to move beyond the legacy of the Saddam era invasion ofKuwait and to prevent any Iraqi Shia-led violence in Kuwait such as occurred in the 1980s. The speaker of Kuwait's National Assembly visited Iraq on February 28, 2019, to mark the anniversary of the liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi invasion. The House of Representatives and Senate passed a resolution of condolence over the death of Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Mubarak in December 2011.
Colombia, one of the oldest democracies in the Western Hemisphere and the third most populous Latin American country, has endured a multisided civil conflict for more than five decades until President Juan Manuel Santos declared the conflict over in August 2017 at the end of a U.N.-monitored disarmament. According to the National Center for Historical Memory 2013 report, presented to the Colombian government as part of the peace process to end the fighting, some 220,000 Colombians died in the armed conflict through 2012, 81% of them civilians. The report also provided statistics quantifying the scale of the conflict, which has taken a huge toll on Colombian society: more than 23,000 selective assassinations between 1981 and 2012; internal displacement of more than 5 million Colombians due to land seizure and violence; 27,000 kidnappings between 1970 and 2010; and 11,000 deaths or amputees from anti-personnel land mines laid primarily by Colombia's main insurgent guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). To date, more than 8 million Colombans, or roughly 15% of the population, have registered as conflict victims. Although the violence has scarred Colombia, the country has achieved a significant turnaround. Once considered a likely candidate to become a failed state, Colombia, over the past two decades, has overcome much of the violence that had clouded its future. For example, between 2000 and 2016, Colombia saw a 94% decrease in kidnappings and a 53% reduction in homicides (below 25 per 100,000 in 2016). Coupled with success in lowering violence, Colombia has opened its economy and promoted trade, investment, and growth. Colombia has become one of Latin America's most attractive locations for foreign direct investment. Yet, after steady growth over several years, Colombia's economy slowed to 3.1% growth in 2015 and declined to 1.7% in 2017. Many analysts identified Colombia's dependence on oil and other commodity exports as the primary cause. The United States is Colombia's leading trade partner. The U.S.-Colombian Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force in May 2012, and by 2020, it will phase out all tariffs and other barriers to bilateral trade between Colombia and the United States, its largest trade partner, by 2020. Colombia is also a founding member of the Pacific Alliance and Colombia's accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May 2018, following a review of the country's macroeconomic policies and changes, is a major new development. The Santos government and the FARC signed a peace accord in November 2016. The accord was narrowly defeated in a popular referendum held in early October 2016, but was revised by the government and agreed to by the FRC and then ratified by the Colombian Congress. The peace process was recognized as the most significant achievement of the Santos presidency and lauded outside of Colombia and throughout the region. In 2018, Colombians elected a new congress in March and a new president in June. Iván Duque, who was inaugurated on August 7, 2018, at the age of 42, was the youngest Colombian president elected in a century. He was the handpicked candidate of former president Álvaro Uribe, who vocally opposed many of Santos's policies. Through alliance building, Duque achieved a functional majority or a "unity" government, which involved the Conservative Party, Santos's prior National Unity or Party of the U, joining the Democratic Center (CD) party, although compromise was required to keep the two centrist parties in sync with the more conservative CD. In the new Congress, two extra seats, for the presidential and vice presidential runners up, became automatic seats in the Colombian Senate and House, due to a constitutional change in 2015, allowing presidential runner up Gustavo Petro to return to the Senate. The CD party, which gained seats in both houses in the March vote, won the majority in the Colombia Senate. President Duque proposed a leadership role for Colombia in denouncing the authoritarian government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and containing his damage to the country. By late November 2018, 1.2 million Venezuelans already present in Colombia were putting pressure on the government's finances, generating a burden on Colombia's gross domestic product (GDP) of nearly 0.5% of GDP. In January 2019, the Trump Administration announced backing for the president of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as interim president of Venezuela. The
The federal individual income tax is a progressive tax system, with a top marginal tax rate of 39.6% and a base rate of 10% for individuals and 25% for married couples. The top marginal income tax rate is set to return to the levels it was in 2017, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, under P.L. 115-97, often referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For tax years starting after December 31, 2017, and before January 1. 1, individual tax rates are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. For individuals receiving income from passthrough businesses (i.e., partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships), the current rates can be adjusted downward as a result of a new deduction under Section 199A; the deduction is equal to up to 20% of a noncorporate business owner's qualified income from a qualified trade or business. During periods of relatively high inflation, a progressive income tax based on tax brackets set in nominal dollars can lead to automatic tax increases, and these increases may lead to unintended changes in the overall distribution of the tax burden by income class. This is because nominal incomes rise faster than real incomes, all other things being equal. As a result, tax burdens for taxpayers become larger than what lawmakers had intended when they established existing statutory tax rates. In the absence of indexation of the elements of the income tax code determining the tax burdens of individuals, an increasing share of taxpayers will face growing tax liabilities because their nominal incomes are rising, irrespective of what happens to their real incomes. The effects of inflation on income tax liabilities can be substantial, even in periods of low inflation, such as the last two decades. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, $1,000 in November 1988 had the buying power of $2,095.08 in November 2018. Year-to-year changes can be negligible, but over a decade or so, those changes can add up to make a substantial difference through the power of compounding. In analyzing the effects of U.S. individual income taxes, it is important to be clear about which rates are being discussed. Among tax analysts, the three most widely used measures are statutory rates (STRs), marginal effective rates (MERs), and averageeffective rates (AERs). Effective rates measure how STRs are affected by tax provisions that modify someone's taxable income or tax liability. A taxpayer's MER shows the percentage of an additional dollar of income that is taxed, while her/her AER indicates how much of her/his total income is taxed. For many individuals, the interaction between special provisions in the tax code and their specific financial circumstances leads to differences between their effective and statutory rates. Among the provisions that can drive a wedge between the two rates are the earned income tax credit (EITC), the alternative minimum tax (AMT), and personal exemptions and deductions. Personal circumstances that can cause MERs to diverge from STRs include the sources of income, itemized deductions, the number of children (if any) eligible for the child tax credit and the EITC, and filing status. Most economists believe that taxpayers change their economic behavior in response to MERs, not to statutory rates, and believe that a person's MER influences important decisions concerning whether and how much to work, howMuch to spend, and how Much to Save. For example, someone's MER may help determine whether he takes on an overtime shift, bargains for wages and benefits, takes a second job, or even enters the labor force. The idea that MERs help shape an individual's economic behavior can be extended to an entire tax system. A broader analysis along these lines goes beyond the scope of this report.
The Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended (OAA; 42 U.S.C. 3056 et seq.) authorizes the Social Security Administration (DOL) to establish and administer the Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA) program. The SCSEP program is administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) at the Department of Labor and is the only OAA program administered by DOL. The OAA has been reauthorized numerous times, most recently in 2016 (P.L. 114-144). Prior to the 2016 OAA reauthorization, the OAA Amendments of 2006 reauthorized all programs under the act through FY2011, and authorized appropriations for OAA-authorized activities for FY2017 through FY2019. Although the authorizations of appropriations under the O AA expired at the end of FY2011 and were not renewed in 2016, Congress continued to appropriate funding for the act's authorized activities through FY2016. This report provides a brief overview of the SC SEP program, including its authorization, administration, and Terminology. It will be updated as legislative activity warrants.

The Export Controls Act of 2018 (ECA; P.L. 115-232, Subtitle B, Part I), which became law on August 13, 2018, provides broad, detailed legislative authority for the President to implement dual-use export controls. The law repeals the Export Administration Act EAA of 1979, which was the underlying statutory authority for dual- use export controls until it expired in 2001. After the EAA's expiration, the export control system created pursuant to that law was continued by a presidential declaration of a national emergency and the invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The ECA, which has no expiration date, requires the President and the Secretary of Commerce to control "the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of items subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, whether by United States persons or by foreign persons," as well as the activities of U.S. persons, wherever located, relating to specific (A) nuclear explosive devices; (B) missiles; (C) chemical or biological weapons; (D) whole plants for chemical weapons precursors; (E) foreign maritime nuclear projects; and (F) foreign military intelligence services. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce administers the export licensing and enforcement functions of the dual-used export controls system. The Department of Defense's Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA) oversees the technical and national security review of export licenses and commodity jurisdiction requests received from the Departments of Commerce and State. The Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) investigates the transfer of sensitive defense technologies to proscribed nations and criminal elements. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and Department of Energy regulate nuclear materials and technology. The Office of Defense Trade Compliance (ODTC) administers civil and criminal enforcement actions. The National Security Division (National Security Division) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conduct criminal investigations and prosecutions. The Export Enforcement Office (OEE) at BIS investigates criminal and administrative export control violations. The Counter-Proliferation Investigations Unit (CIU) at the Departmentof Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigates violations of dual use and munitions export controls, exports to sanctioned countries, and violations of economic embargoes. In addition, export controls are enforced at the port of departure by DHS Customs and Border Protection. The United States restricts the export of defense articles; dual-using goods and technology; certain nuclear materials; and items that would assist in the development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons or the missile technology used to deliver them. A defense item is defined by regulation as one that "[m]eets the criteria of a defense article or defense service on the U. S. Munitions List" or "[p]rovides the equivalent performance capabilities" on that list. Dual-use goods are commodities, software, or technologies that have both civilian and military applications. TheUnited States also controls certain exports in adherence to several multilateral nonproliferation control regimes. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) requires the executive branch to control nuclear-related items, but the law does not explicitly require that these items be the same as those controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). In addition to U.s. controls, internationally there are four major multilateral control regimes: the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear supplier group, the Wassenaar Arrangement, and the Nuclear Nonprolificates Control regimes. All of these regimes have catch-all controls, which allow for the control of nonlisted items if they are to be used for a military or proliferation-related purpose. The Obama Administration's Export Control Initiative, announced in August 2009, proposed a four-pronged approach to reform that would create a single export control licensing agency for both dual-uses and munitions and exports licensed to embargoed destinations; a unified control list; a single enforcement coordination agency; and a single integrated information technology system, which would include a single database of sanctioned and denied parties. The Administration's blueprint envisioned that these changes would be implemented in three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action.
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, is the federal legislation that establishes the general minimum wage that must be paid to all covered workers. The FLSA mandates broad minimum wage coverage. It also specifies certain categories of workers who are not covered by general FLSA wage standards, such as workers with disabilities or certain youth workers. In 1938, the FLSA established a minimum wage of $0.25 per hour. Since its establishment, the minimum wage rate has been raised 22 separate times. The most recent change was enacted in 2007 (P.L. 110-28), which increased the federal minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to its current rate of $7.25 in three steps (the final step occurring in 2009). This report provides a brief overview of state minimum wage policies in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It begins with a brief discussion of FLSA minimum wage Coverage. It then provides a summary of states' minimum wage laws, followed by an examination of rates and mechanisms of adjustments in states with minimum wage levels above the federal rate. Next, the report discusses the interaction of federal and state minimum wages over time, and finally, the Appendix provides detailed information on the major components of minimum wage policy in all 50 states. The report concludes with a discussion of the potential mechanisms for future minimum wage adjustments in these states. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants. For more detailed information, see CRS Report RL33498, State Minimum Wage Policy: Analysis of Federal and State Minimum Wages, by [author name scrubbed] et al., which is available in abbreviated form as CRS In Focus IF10240, The Federal Minimum Wage: Analysis and Policy Considerations in 50 States and the D.C. Appendix, coordinated with CRS Legal Sidebar WSLG-10240(pdf), which provides a more in-depth analysis of federal minimum wages in the states. In the United States, the federal wage is the wage floor for most of the civilian labor force, but it is not the floor for the vast majority of the labor force. The federal rate is the floor in 29 states (representing 39% of the U.S. labor force) with minimum wages higher than the current federal rate, while in the remaining 14 states, the rate is lower than or equal to the federal level. In addition, the number of states with higher minimum wages increased from 8 in 1992 to 12 in 2003, but the share of the workforce in states for which the federal rates served as the floor decreased from 92% to 82% from 1997 to 2007. In most states, minimum wage rates are set at some point in each year, but a few states have rate increases scheduled for later in the year. For those states with current or scheduled minimum wages above the national rate, three main mechanisms are in place to adjust future rates: (1) scheduled increases, (2) indexation to inflation, or (3) reference to the national minimum wage plus an add-on (i.e., a state minimum rate is a percentage or dollar amount above the state rate). For the 21 states with rates that are equal to or below the federal hourly rate, however, there are no mechanisms in place that move rates above the rate. Thus, the main difference within this group of states is the relationship of the state wage rate, if any, to that of the national wage rate. For the 29 states with a minimum rate above the minimum rate in 2019, minimum hourly rates range from $8.50 per hour in New Mexico to $12.00 in Massachusetts and Washington and $14.00 for the District.
One of the most common methods for redistributing spending priorities in appropriations bills on the House floor is through offset amendments. House offset amendments generally change spending priorities by increasing spending for certain activities (or creating spending for new activities not previously included in the bill) and offsetting the increase(s) by decreasing or striking funding for other activities. For example, an amendment increasing funding for one agency by $3 million and decreasing funding for another agency by the same amount in the same bill would be an offset amendment. These amendments may transfer funds between two activities or among several activities. In addition, certain offset amendments may reduce funding with across-the-board spending reductions. This report is an introduction to selected House rules and practices governing the consideration of offset amendments to appropriations measures considered in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union. It analyzes the parliamentary context providing the need for offset amendments; the two types of offset amendment, clause 2(f) and reachback (or fetchback) offset amendments, including procedural factors regarding each; and the mechanisms for waiving House rules. The report concludes with highlights on the procedural advantages of each offset amendment type. This is not an official statement of House procedures. The House Parliamentarian advises the presiding officer on procedural issues regarding offset amendments and other matters. Although this report provides useful background information, it should not be considered a substitute for consultation with the Parliamentarian on specific procedural problems and opportunities. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, requires that each budget resolution establish total new budget authority and outlay ceilings for federal government activities for the upcoming fiscal year. Once these figures are finalized, they are required to be allocated among the House committees with jurisdiction over spending, and each committee is given specific spending ceilings (referred to as the 302(a) allocations). The House Appropriations Committee receives separate allocations for discretionary and direct spending and, in turn, is required under Section 302(b) to subdivide its 302(e) allocations among its 12 appropriations subcommittees, providing each subcommittee with its spending ceiling (302(b)(b) subdivisions). In the case of the Appropriations Committee, these allocations are only established for the next fiscal year because appropriations measures are annual. In some cases (particularly supplementals), supplemental appropriations measures, or the last regular appropriations bills to be considered, the total spending ceilings for a given year are also set for that fiscal year as well. An amendment increasing a lump-sum or line-item appropriation, therefore, could increase the amount of funding in a bill, causing it to exceed these ceilings. As a result, such an amendment typically requires an offset for it to be in order. In cases in which the lump- sum appropriation includes a set-aside that does not affect the entire amount, an Amendment setting aside only the remaining funds or a portion of those funds would also not increase spending. If enacted, the effect of either case would be reductions in funding for activities that were not set aside to accommodate funding in the bills that was specified as set- asides. To avoid such reductions, amendments may include offsets from other appropriations in thebill. Clause 2(F) offset Amendments consist of two or more amendments considered together (or en bloc) that would change amounts by directly adding text or changing text in the body of the bill. Reachback offset amendments are generally offered at the end of a bill that change funding amounts by reference. They must offset budget authority, but not necessarily outlays; may add new lump- Sums and set-Asides, subject to certain restrictions; may not include unauthorized appropriations; must be drafted to avoid a demand for a division of the question; and may provide across- the-board reductions as offsets.
From its headwaters in Colorado and Wyoming to its terminus in the Gulf of California, the Colorado River Basin covers more than 246,000 square miles. The river runs through seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California) and Mexico. Pursuant to federal law, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation, part of the Department of the Interior) plays a prominent role in the management of the basin's waters. In the Lower Basin (i.e., Arizona, California, and Nevada), Reclamation also serves as water master, a role that elevates the status of the federal government in basin water management. Colorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) purposes, but it also is important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation, among other uses. A majority (70%) of basin water supplies are used to irrigate 5.5 million acres of land; basin waters also provide M&I water supplies to nearly 40 million people. Much of the area that depends on the river for water supplies is outside of the drainage area for the basin. Federal water storage and conveyance facilities in the basin provide trans-basin diversions that serve areas such as Cheyenne, WY; multiple cities in Colorado's Front Range (e.g., Fort Collins, Denver, Boulder, and Colorado Springs, CO); Provo, UT; Albuquerque and Santa Fe, NM; and Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Imperial Valley in Southern California. The Colorado River's hydropower facilities can provide up to 42 gigawatts of electrical power per year. In addition, the river provides habitat for a wide range of species, including several federally endangered species. It flows through 7 national wildlife refuges and 11 National Park Service (NPS) units; these and other areas of the river support important recreational opportunities. In recent years, drought conditions throughout the basin have raised concerns about potential negative impacts on water supplies. While natural flows have trended down, consumptive use in the river has regularly exceeded natural flows since 2000, causing a significant drawdown of basin storage levels. A 2012 study by Reclamation projected that in the coming half century, flows would decrease by an average of 9% at Lee Ferry and drought would increase in frequency and duration. At the same time, Reclamation projects that demand for basin water will increase, with annual consumptive uses projected to rise from 15 million acre-feet (MAF) to 18.1-20.4 MAF by 2050, depending on population growth. A range of 64%-76% of the growth in demand was expected to come from increased M andI demand. Reclamation's 2012 study also posited several potential ways to alleviate future shortages in the Basin, such as alternative water supplies, demand management, drought action plans, water banking, and water transfer/markets. Some of these options already are being pursued. In March 2019, after several years of negotiations, Colorado River basin states and Reclamation finalized drought contingency plans (DCPs) for both the Upper Basin and Lower Basin. These plans required final authorization by Congress to be implemented. Following House and Senate hearings on the DCPs in early April, on April 16, 2019, Congress authorized the DCP agreements in theColorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act (P.L. 116-14). The Lower Basin DCP is designed to require California, Nevada and Arizona to curtail use and thereby contribute additional water to Lake Mead storage at predetermined "trigger" elevations, while also creating additional flexibility to incentivize voluntary conservation of water to be stored in Lake Mead, thereby increasing lake levels. Under the Lower basin DCP, California would commit to cutbacks of 4.5% to 7.9% at Lake Mead elevations of 1,040-1,045 ft, and would increase to as much as 350,000 AF (7.9%) at 1,025 ft or lower. The reductions of supply would reach their maximums when reservoir levels drop below 1,045ft. The DCP also would, for the first time, include commitments for delivery cutbacks by California. Although most Colorado River contractors supported the agreements, one major basin contractor, Imperial Irrigation District (IID, a major holder of water rights in southern California), did not approve the DCCs. IID has
Congress has long deliberated on drinking water quality and infrastructure, which have been brought to the forefront of national attention by several events. Such events include the detection of elevated lead levels in tap water in Flint, MI, and other cities; hurricanes and other natural disasters that damaged or destroyed community drinking water infrastructure; and local source water contamination events (e.g., chemical spills and algal blooms). In March 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its sixth Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment. In this survey, EPA estimated that public water systems would need to invest $472.60 billion for drinking water capital improvements over the next 20 years to achieve compliance and ensure the provision of safe drinking water. Although all projects identified in the needs survey would promote health objectives, EPA reported that 12% of the 20-year estimated need was directly attributed to statutory compliance. The majority (88%) of needs are for ongoing investments, such as repair of aging drinkingwater infrastructure. In 2012, the American Water Works Association (AWWA) reported that the costs to replace aging drinkingWater infrastructure and expand water service to growing populations will increase to more than $1 trillion over theNext 25 years. As of early 2019, EPA's database indicated that some 50,000 public water system in the United States regularly serve 25 or more of the same individuals. About 80% of these community water systems are relatively small, serving 3,300 or fewer people. These small systems have a narrow rate base from which to finance drinking water Infrastructure improvements. In addition, older cities may face declining populations and declining utility revenues from which utilities can finance infrastructure repairs. AWIA was enacted on October 23, 2018, as P.L. 115-270. It amends the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to revise existing drinking water programs, reauthorize appropriations for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) and other programs, and establish new programs to address water infrastructure affordability and water system compliance capacity and sustainability. It also authorizes new grant programs to reduce lead contamination in school drinking water, assist small and disadvantaged communities, and develop public water infrastructure resilience, among other purposes. The act also includes several amendments to the Clean Water Act to address stormwater by expanding a municipal sewer overflow grant program to include stormwater management projects and directing EPA to establish a task force to manage stormwater. The Water Infrastructure Finance Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, which provides credit assistance for water infrastructure projects, was also reauthorized in AWIA. It authorizes an additional $5 million to be appropriated for WIFIA to provide credit assistance to state finance authorities to support combined projects eligible for assistance from the CWSRF and the DWSRF. This additional appropriation is available only to the extent that both the two programs are funded at FY2018 levels or 105% of previous year's funding, whichever is greater, and when EPA receives at least $50.0 million in WifIA appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, included $60 million to cover EPA's subsidy costs of WIFI loans and $8 million to support program administration. These appropriations are available until expended. This report analyzes the drinking water provisions of AWIA, which was enacted in October 2018. It will be updated as warranted.
Since 1917, a total of 365 women have been elected or appointed to serve in the U.S. Congress. Women account for 23.7% of voting Members in the House and Senate (127 of 535); 24.2% of total Members in Congress (131 of 541, including the Delegates and Resident Commissioner); 23.4% of Representatives (102 of 435); and 25.0% of Senators (56 of the 100 Senators and 2 of the 33 Delegates) in the 116th Congress. This report provides historical information on the number and percentage of women in Congress over time; means of entry to Congress; comparisons to international and state legislatures; records for tenure; firsts for women; African American, Asian Pacific, Hispanic American, and American Indian (Native American) women; and women in leadership.

The Office of Advocacy (Advocacy) is an "independent" office within the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) that is responsible for advancing "the views and concerns of small businesses before Congress, the White House, federal agencies, the federal courts, and state and local policymakers as appropriate." The Chief Counsel for Advocacy directs the office and is appointed by the President from civilian life with the advice and consent of the Senate. Advocacy supports the development and growth of American small businesses by "intervening early in federal agencies' regulatory development processes on proposals that affect small entities and providing Regulatory Flexibility Act compliance training to federal agency policymakers and regulatory development officials; producing research to inform policymakers and other stakeholders on the impact of federal regulatory burdens on small businesses; documenting the vital role of small business in the economy; and fostering a two-way communication between federal agencies and the small business community." Advocacy's responsibilities have expanded over time, and legislation has been introduced in recent Congresses to increase its authority still further. For example, during the 115th Congress, H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (Title III, Small Business Regulatoryflexibility Improvements Act), would have, among other provisions, revised and enhanced requirements for federal agency notification of the Chief Counsel prior to the publication of any proposed rule; expanded the required use ofsmall business advocacy review panels from three federal agencies to all federal agencies; empowered the Chief counsel to issue rules governing federal agency compliance with the RFA; specifically authorized the chief counsel to file comments on any notice of proposed rulemaking, not just when the R FA is concerned; and transferred size standard determinations for purposes other than the Small Business Act and Small Business Investment Act of 1958 from the SBA's Administrator to the chief Counsel. In addition, S. 83, the Advocacy Empowerment Act of 2019, would empower theChief Counsel to issue regulations governing federal agencies compliance withthe RFA. During the 114th Congress (2015-2016), S. 2847, the Prove It Act of 2016, which was reported by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, would have authorized the Chief Counsels to request the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to review any federal agency certification that a proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and, as a result, is not required to submit a regulatory flexibility analysis of the rule. If it is determined that the proposed rule would have a substantial economic impact, the agency would then be required to perform both an initial and a final regulatory flexibility analyses for the rule, as required by the bill. The bill was reintroduced in the 115 th Congress (S. 2014, theprove it act of 2017). Advocacy has 55 staff members and received an appropriation of $9.120 million for FY2019. Staff salaries and benefits account for about 95% of the office's budget, with the remainder used for economic research grants and direct expenses, such as subscriptions, travel, training, and office supplies. The Office's budget is provided through a separate appropriations account in the General Fund of the Treasury, rather than being included in the Salaries and Expenses' Executive Direction account, as has been the practice in the past. This report will be updated as events warrant.
The administration of federal elections is carried out by the executive and legislative branches of state and local government. In the United States, that typically means states and localities. The administration of elections is highly decentralized. Elections are primarily administered by thousands of state- and local-level election systems rather than a single, unified national system. Understanding how those systems work may be relevant to Congress for at least two reasons. First, the way election administration systems work can affect how well federal action on election administration serves its intended purposes. Second, Congress can require or encourage changes to the way state or local election systems work. Congress has a number of tools for influencing election administration policy. These tools can—either intentionally or unintentionally—affect the workings of the systems that administer federal elections. This report is intended to help Congress understand how these systems work and how their workings might relate to federal election administration. It starts by describing the distribution of election administration duties at the state level and the structures of those systems that conduct elections. It then uses examples from past federal action to illustrate some of the ways the duties and structures of these systems interact with federal activity. It closes by introducing some considerations that may be of interest to Members interested in election administration, such as how a proposed change would interact with the duties or structures of the current system or the advantages and disadvantages of possible changes. The report concludes with an Appendix that lists selected federal statutes governing state and Local Administration of Federal Elections, including some that have been enacted and some of which have not. For example, the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA; P.L. 107-252; 116 Stat. 1666) requires states to establish a uniform standard of what counts as a vote for each voting system they use (52 U.S.C. §21081(a)(6), and bills have been introduced in recent Congresses to change how voter registration is handled. In addition, the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) has reported that the federal role in administering federal elections may be affected by the structure and duties of state election systems. The federal government can provide funding for election administration in the states, which may be conditional on the adoption of certain election administration policies or practices. How well such funding is used may depend in part on how timely it is and how well-tailored it is to its objectives. How quickly federal agencies share election administration information with the appropriate state officials may also be affected. Past federal action has resulted in both intentional and unintentional changes to state andlocal election systems, as well as the side effects of other federal activities. For instance, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) requires a single state office to provide uniformed services and overseas voters with information about voter registration and absentee voting, and HAVA requires chief state election officials to implement statewide voter registration lists and oversee development of plans for use of federal election Administration funding. Some of these changes have also had the side effect of shifting responsibilities from the state to the local level. The interactions between the duties, structures, and federal actions on election systems and past federal actions suggest some considerations for Congress as it considers proposals that would affect election administration at the federal level. These include the following: How would any proposed change interact with election duties and structure? How might the nature of the system inform the proposed change? Which of the policy tools available to Congress is best suited to achieving the purpose of the change? How would the design of a change need to be adjusted to accommodate variations between or within states? Would it be more effective to advance a change with a federal requirement, or incentivize it via federal funding? How could federalism-related issues be addressed with intervening in the relationships between states and their political subdivisions?
Iran ratified the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1970. Article III of the treaty requires non-nuclear-weapon states-parties to accept comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards; Tehran concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the agency in 1974. In 2002, the agency began investigating allegations that Iran had conducted clandestine nuclear activities; the IAEA ultimately reported that some of these activities had violated Tehran's safeguards agreement. Following more than three years of investigation, the IEAA Board of Governors referred the matter to the U.N. Security Council in February 2006. Since then, the council has adopted six resolutions requiring Iran to take steps to alleviate international concerns about its nuclear program. In July 2015, the Security Council adopted Resolution 2231, which, along with the NPT, composes the current legal framework governing Iran's nuclear program and requires Tehran to implement the July 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The JCPOA contains a "snap back" mechanism to reimpose sanctions should Iran fail to resolve satisfactorily a P5+1 claim regarding Iranian J CPOA noncompliance. This report provides a brief overview of Iran's uranium enrichment program and describes the legal basis for the actions taken by the I AEA board and the United Nations Security Council.

On February 9, 2018, President Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 into law (P.L. 115-123). The act established a joint select committee to reform the budget and appropriations process in Congress. The act required that the committee be composed of 16 members, with 4 members appointed by each of the Speaker of the House, the majority leader of the Senate, the minority leader of each chamber, and the Senate minority leader. Members were to be appointed to serve for the life of the committee, with any vacancy to be filled within 14 calendar days. The committee was to be led by two cochairs, one appointed jointly by the Speaker and Senate majority leader, with the other appointed by the House and Senate minority leaders. The bill required the committee to report to the Senate Committee on the Budget, which was to report the bill favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation within seven session days—but without any revisions. If the committee failed to do so, it would be discharged from consideration of the bill and the bill would be placed on the Senate Calendar of Business. Under the act, the committee terminated on December 31, 2018. Not later than two days of Senate session after a joint committee bill was reported or discharged from the Budget Committee, the Senate would be required to vote on a motion to proceed to consider it. The motion would be considered for a maximum of 10 hours, evenly divided between the majority and minority leaders (or their designees) and would require a vote of three-fifths of all Senators—60 votes if there is not more than one vacancy—to pass. The Senate would then consider the bill under its regular rules, meaning that it could be fully debatable and fully amendable (possibly including by nongermane amendments) and that cloture might need to be invoked on one or more questions in order to reach a final vote. This report answers frequently asked questions about the creation of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform in the 115th Congress. It will be updated as warranted by legislative activity.

This report provides responses to frequently asked questions about the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. It is intended to serve as a quick reference to provide easy access to information and data. Appendix B presents a series of tables with state-level data. On January 24, 2019, the President signed legislation (P.L. 116-4) that funds TANF and related programs through June 30, 2019. The legislation permits states to receive their quarterly TANf grants for the 2nd quarter (January through March) and 3rd quarter (April through June) of FY2019. Additional legislation would be required to pay TAN F grants in the final quarter (July through September) ofFY2019. In FY2018, the federal government provided $16.5 billion in basic block grants to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Indian tribes. There is also a contingency fund available that provides extra federal funds to states that meet certain conditions. Additionally, states are required to expend a minimum amount of their own funds for TANFs and related activities under what is known as the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement. States are also required to spend at least 75% of what they spent in FY1994 on their predecessor programs. The minimum MOE amount, in total, is $10.3 billion per year for states, territories, and the territories. The federal government also provides a " caseload reduction credit" to states to reduce the number of families receiving cash assistance. The caselload reduction credit reduces the participation standard one percentage point for each percentage point decline in a state's casel load. States that do not meet the work participation standard are at risk of being penalized through a reduction in their block grant, but penalties can be forgiven if the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) finds that a state had "reasonable cause" for not meeting the standard. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L., 109-171) made several changes to the work Participation rules effective in FY2007. The work participation standards were broadened to include families receiving TANO cash aid in "separate state programs." Separate state programs are programs run with state funds, distinct from a states' "tANF program," but with expenditures countable toward the TANP's MOE. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA,P.l. 111-5) held states "harmless" for caselroad increases affecting the standards for FY2009 through FY2011. It did so by allowing states to "freeze" caselards reduction credits at pre-recession levels through the FY2011 standards. The number of states that did not meet their all-families standard declined over the FY2012 to FY2017 period, and in FY2017, two jurisdictions did not met the all-family participation standard: Nevada and Guam. In addition to meeting a work standard for all families, the DRA also imposes a second standard—90%—for the two-parent portion of its cash assistance caselock. This standard can also be lowered by caselory reduction. Of the 28 jurisdictions that had two- parent families in their FY2017 work participation calculation, 19 met the 90% standard and 9 did not.
Budget justifications are detailed written materials, data, and supporting documents provided by federal agencies that expand upon and support the President's yearly budget submission to Congress. In form and content, the justifications may vary by agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides yearly instructions to agencies for producing materials to be included in the budget submission and agency budget justifications. Each summer, OMB issues these instructions as part of a document entitled, Circular No. 110-225. Agencies submit budget justification materials to the appropriations subcommittees to support agency testimony and inform congressional deliberations. Beginning with the FY2008 executive budget cycle, agencies have also been required to post their congressional budget justification materials on the internet within two weeks of transmittal to Congress, beginning with the Department of Labor in FY2008. Historical budget justification material back to FY2008 is available on OMB's budget justification website at http://www. OMB.gov/budget. Historical Department of the Treasury budget justification documents back to the FY2007 are available on the Treasury website at  http:// www.treasury.gov.

Under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, the President and the Senate share responsibility for making appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as to various lower courts of the federal judiciary. While the President nominates persons to fill federal judgeships, the appointment of each nominee also requires Senate confirmation. Historically, the vast majority of appointments to federal judgeship (other than to the Supreme Court) have typically not involved much public disagreement between the President, the Senate, or between the parties within the Senate. Typically, such nominations were both reported out of the Judiciary Committee and confirmed by the Senate without any recorded opposition. In recent decades, however, appointments to two kinds of lower federal courts—the U. s. circuit courts of appeals and the U s. district courts—have often been the focus of heightened Senate interest and debate, as has the process itself for appointing judges to these courts. Given congressional interest in the subject, this report provides statistics and analysis related to the nomination and confirmation of U. S. circuit and district court judges from 1977 (the beginning of the Carter presidency) through 2018 (the second year of the Trump presidency). The report's exclusive focus is on the courts of appeal and district courts. Excluded from the scope of the report are the United States Court of International Trade; the UnitedStates Court of Federal Claims; and territorial district courts (e.g., the District Court of Guam). This report will be updated as warranted. For more information, see CRS Report R44405, U.s. Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Supreme Court Appointment Processes in the 115th Congress, by [author name scrubbed]; CRS In Focus IF10101, Supreme Court Nominees: From 1977 through 2018, by the numbers of circuit court nominees confirmed; and CRS Reports R44406, District Court Nominations and Confirmation: By the Numbers, 1977-2018, by Congress. For each of the six completed presidencies during the Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, George W.Bush, Obama, and Trump Administrations, the median number of nominees confirmed in the first two years of a presidency ranged from a low of 41.0 days during the Reagan presidency to a high of 215.0 Days during the Obama presidency. For the first three years of each presidency, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation ranged from 68.7 to 350.6 days for circuit court and 215.5 days for district court nominees. For circuit court nominations submitted to the Senate during a completed presidency (from 1977-1978 through 2018), the greatest percentage of nominees were confirmed (93.3%) and the smallest percentage (71.8%) were confirmed during the George W.-W. Bush presidency. Of two-term Presidents, the high ranged from 88.3% (Reagan) to 83.2% (Obama). For district courtnominees confirmed during a complete presidency (1977-2018), the highest percentage was 94.8%, and the lowest percentage (77.1%) was confirmed during both the Reagan and H.W. W.-George H. H. Bush presIDencies. For U.N. General Accounting Office (NGAO) Census Bureau (CBO) Census data, for the first year of each completed presidency from 1977 to 2018, the highest and lowest percentage of NGAO Census data reported in this report was 88.0%. For the second-lowest percentage reported in the report was 98.6% ( Reagan). For the third-highest and lowest percentages reported were 98.0% (Clinton) and 98.5% (George W. George W.) Bush. For both the first and second years of every completed presidency since the Carter Administration, the percentage of circuit andDistrict Court nominees confirmed within 90 days (i.e., within approximately three months) of being nominated was lower than the percentage confirmed within this time frame (76% and 4%, respectively).
Multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC), which are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs, have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. MYP is an alternative to the standard or default approach of annual contracting. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of Procurement, without having to exercise a contract option for every year after the first year. Under BBC, DOD can use a single BBC contract for more than one year of procurement. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a contract for a single year'sworth of procurement, but differs from MYP by not requiring congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC was invented by Section 121(b) of the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1119/P.L. 105-85 of November 18, 1997), which granted the Navy the authority to use single contracts for the procurement of the first four Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines. The four boats were scheduled to be procured during the 5-year period FY1998-FY2002 in annual quantities of 1-1-0-1,1. Congress provided the authority at least in part to reduce the combined procurement cost of the four submarines. Since its use at the start of the Virginia-class program, BBC has been used very rarely. The Navy did not use it again in a shipbuilding program until December 2010, when it awarded two block buy contracts, each covering 10 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs), to the two LCS builders. (Each contract was later amended to include an 11th ship in FY2016, making for a total of 22 ships under the two contracts.) BBC might be used in cases where using a multiyear contract can reduce costs, but the program in question cannot meet all the statutory criteria needed to qualify for MYP. For example, the Navy is using a block buy contract to procure the first six ships in the John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler program. A fourth example, arguably, is the Air Force's KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program, which is employing a fixed price incentive fee (FPIF) development contract that includes a "back end" commitment to procure certain minimum numbers of KC- 46s in certain fiscal years. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP or BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of the two contracting mechanisms. Congress's decisions on these issues could affect defense acquisition practices, defense funding requirements, and the defense industrial base.
The U.S. energy pipeline network is integral to the nation's energy supply and provides vital links to other critical infrastructure, such as power plants, airports, and military bases. These pipelines are geographically widespread, running alternately through remote and densely populated regions—from Arctic Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico and nearly everywhere in between. Because these pipelines carry volatile, flammable, or toxic materials, they have the potential to injure the public, destroy property, and damage the environment. The federal pipeline safety program resides primarily within the Department of Transportation's (DOT's) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), although its inspection and enforcement activities rely heavily upon partnerships with the states. Together, the federal and state pipeline safety agencies administer a comprehensive set of regulatory authorities which has changed significantly over the last decade and continues to do so. This report reviews the history of federal programs for pipeline safety, discusses significant safety concerns, and summarizes recent developments focusing on key policy issues. Although pipeline security is not mainly under PHMSA's jurisdiction, the report examines the agency's past role in pipeline security and its recent activities working on security-related issues with other agencies. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-90) and the Pipeline Safety Act of 2016 (the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act (PIPES Act) of 2016, which was signed by President Obama on June 22, 2016, and authorized through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, respectively), respectively, provide the Transportation Secretary with primary authority to regulate key aspects of interstate pipeline safety: design, construction, operation and maintenance, and spill response planning. Pipeline safety regulations are covered in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. As of March 2019, the agency employed 290 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff in its Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS)—including 145 regional inspectors—and in DOT offices outside of OPS that also support pipeline safety functions. Those staff include attorneys, data analysts, information technology specialists, and regulatory specialists required for certain enforcement actions, promulgating regulations, issuing pipeline safety grants, and issuing agreements for pipelinesafety research and development. The agency relies upon a range of enforcement actions to ensure that pipeline operators correct safety violations and take measures to preclude future safety problems. From 2014 through 2018, PHmSA initiated 943 enforcement actions against pipeline operators. Of these cases, 348 resulted in safety orders to operators. The Trump Administration's requested budget authority for PHMSSA is approximately $151 million for FY2020, roughly 8% less than the FY2019 budget authority, with proposed reductions primarily in contract programs, research anddevelopment, and grants to states. The Department of Energy's first Quadrennial Energy Review (QER), released in 2015, highlighted pipeline safety as a growing concern for the country's energy infrastructure. A series of accidents in California, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, among other places, have demonstrated this vulnerability and have heightened congressional concern about pipeline safety. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency charged with determining the probable cause of transportation incidents—including pipeline releases—and promoting transportation safety. It investigates significant incidents, develops factual records, and issues safety recommendations to prevent similar events from reoccurring. In the pipeline sector, specifically, the NTSB's safety recommendations have led to changes in pipeline safety regulation regarding one-call systems before excavation ("Call Before You Dig"), use of pipeline internal inspection devices, facility response plan effectiveness, hydrostatic pressure testing of older pipelines, and other pipeline safety improvements. The NTSB has no statutory authority to regulated transportation, however, and it does not perform cost-benefit analyses of regulatory changes; its recommendations to industry or government agencies are not mandatory. Nonetheless, because of the board's strong reputation for thoroughness and objectivity, over 82% of the NTS B's safety recommendation have been implemented across all transportation modes. In recent years, Congress and industry have called for additional regulatory measures to reduce the likelihood of future pipeline accidents. However, a number of broad pipeline safety rulemakings and many NTSB recommendations remain outstanding, and others have not been in place for long, so their effectiveness in improving pipeline safety have yet to be determined. As Congress continues its oversight of the federal pipeline Safety program, an important focus may be the practical effects of the many changes being made to particular aspects of PHM SA's
This report provides a brief overview of the legislative process in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. It is intended to serve as a resource for congressional staff and Members of Congress and their staffs on legislative procedure. It will be updated as events warrant. This report will not be updated.

South Africa is influential on the African continent due to its investment and political engagement in many African countries and its active role and leadership within the inter-governmental African Union (AU). It also has one of the largest, most diverse and developed economies, and has made substantial progress in spurring post-apartheid socioeconomic transformation. Many of its most damaging socioeconomic effects, however, persist, including high levels of poverty, social inequality, unemployment, and unemployment, as well as unequal access to education, municipal services, and other resources. Such problems disproportionately affect the black population. South Africa also faces broad challenges to social cohesion linked to grievances and fractures stemming from socioeconomic inequality and marginalization, social biases, and criminal activity. These include periodic xenophobic mob attacks on African immigrants and their businesses, crime-motivated attacks on white farmers, frequent de facto residential racial and socioeconomic segregation, and high rates of violent crime—notably murder and rape, along with gender violence more broadly, and gun crime. The country also has faced several recent droughts, including one that resulted in extreme water shortages in Cape Town, a global tourist destination with a population of 3.7 million people. In February 2018, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was elected by the parliament after his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, resigned. Zuma had faced intense pressure to step down after years of weak economic growth and multiple corruption scandals under his tenure. He resigned under the threat of a parliamentary no confidence vote after defying a decision by leaders of his African National Congress (ANC) to remove him as its national presidential nominee. The ANC, the majority party in parliament, replaced Zuma with then-Vice President Ramaphosso, whom the ANC elected as its leader in late 2017. Ramaphoso is leading a reform agenda to address these challenges. He is serving out the rest of Zuma's term, which ends in May 2019, and is eligible to run for two additional five-year terms of his own. Local and international expectations of him are high, but he faces diverse fiscal, structural, and political challenges. U.S.-South Africa ties are cordial, based in part on shared democratic values and broad bilateral accord on regional development goals, and the State Department describes South Africa as a strategic U. S. partner. The United States has been a top African recipient of South Africa-implemented development and crisis response activities in other African countries since the early 1990s. In 2010, the Obama Administration and the South African government initiated a U.N. Security Council Strategic Partnership. While it remains in effect, a biennial dialogue that accompanied the partnership was last held in 2015. The partnership has focused on cooperation in such areas as health, education, food security, law enforcement, trade, investment, and energy, all long-standingU.S. priorities. Since 2014, South Africa has been the largest U.L. trade partner in Africa, and it is also a key regional export and investment destination for the United States. In 2017, it was the 35th-largest source of U.R. imports and the 43rd-largest U.D. export destination globally. South African foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United Kingdom in 2017 totaled $1.3 billion, and in 2018, it is projected to reach $1 billion. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA, Title I, reauthorized in 2015 for 10 years under P.L., 114-27) makes it the largest non-oil-focused AGOA beneficiary and the second largest overall, although the value of its exports under AGOa has fallen since peaking at $3.6 billion in 2013. SouthAfrica is also the only African country with a commercial nuclear power plant. The Zuma administration planned to increase the county's 51,309 megawatts of power generation capacity by 9,600 megawatts (MW) by 2030 by constructing six to eight new nuclear power plants. The project's estimated cost ranged widely, between $30 billion and $100 billion. Cost and environmental concerns spurred substantial opposition to the plan, as did opacity surrounding pre-bid negotiations with Russia. Due to the lack of concrete cost estimates, the Treasury refused to authorize the release of a formal vendor request for proposals. Leaked details regarding accords with Russia and its Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation (Rosatom SOE) suggested that a deal would have strongly favored Russian financial interests
Congress enacted the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA; P.L. 92-583, 16 U.S.C. §§1451-1466) in 1972 and has amended the act 11 times, most recently in 2009. CZMA sets up a national framework for states and territories to consider and manage coastal resources. If a state or territory chooses to develop a coastal management program and the program is approved, the state or territories (1) becomes eligible for several federal grants and (2) can perform reviews of federal agency actions in coastal areas (known as federal consistency determination reviews). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Office for Coastal Management (OCM) in the Department of Commerce (DOC) administers the NCZMP, which is administered by the Secretary of Commerce. Thirty-five states and the territories (including states surrounding the Great Lakes, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) are eligible to participate. Although all 35 eligible states and Territories have at some point chosen to participate, 34 are currently part of the National coastal zone management program (NCZMP). Participation in the NC ZMP provides various benefits to participants, including access to several federal grant programs and the right to review federal actions for consistency with state coastal policies. Since 1972, NOAA has allocated over $2 billion in federal grants to eligible coastal states, territories, and Indian tribes to manage coastal zone resources. In FY2017, Congress appropriated $85 million to NOAA for coastal management grants. Of that total, NOAA allocated nearly $58 million for Section 306 grants, with smaller amounts awarded for Sections 306A, 309, and 310 grants or withdrawn or withdrawn via government-wide rescissions and NOAA assessments. Congress has continued to appropriate funding for these programs, but the programs' authorizations of appropriations have expired. Since 1995, two pieces of legislation have been enacted to reauthorize appropriations for a C ZMA grant program (P. l. 104-150 in 1996, which reauthorized appropriations for the Section 306, 306A and 309 grant programs, and P.l. 111-11 in 2009, which established and authorized appropriations for Section 307A). In FY2019, as in FY2018, NOAA proposed to eliminate all coastal management grant programs. According to the FY2019 budget proposal, NOAA would "continue to support states' participation in the National CZM program by reviewing and supporting implementation of states' management plans, supporting Federal consistency reviews, and providing technical assistance services." Some stakeholders have contended that financial assistance to states is important and more funding is necessary. For example, in a 2016 GAO survey, state coastal zone managers stated that "financial assistance provided by NOAA [was] critical" and that the amount of financial assistance available was insufficient to address states' needs in implementing projects. Others argue that funding should not be appropriated to the programs, making the authorizations for appropriations no longer necessary.
The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on certain mortgage loans. If a mortgage borrower defaults on a mortgage—that is, does not repay the mortgage as promised—and the home goes to foreclosure, FHA is to pay the lender the remaining amount that the borrower owes. FHA insurance protects the lender, rather than the borrower, in the event of borrower default; a borrower who defaults on an FHA-insured mortgage will still experience the consequences of foreclosure. To be eligible for FHA mortgage insurance, the mortgage must be originated by a lender that has been approved by FHA, and the mortgage and the borrower must meet certain criteria. This report provides background on FHA's history and market role and an overview of the basic eligibility and underwriting criteria for F HA-insured home loans. It also provides data on the number and dollar volume of mortgages that FHA insures, along with data onFHA's market share in recent years. The report also provides a brief overview of how the single-family mortgage insurance program is funded and accounted for in the federal budget. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) specifies the way in which the costs of federal loan guarantees, including FHA insured loans, are recorded in the budget. It requires that the estimated lifetime cost of guaranteed loans (in net present value terms) be recorded for the year that the loans are insured. When the present value of the lifetime cash flows associated with the guaranteed loans is expected to result in less money coming into the account than flowing out of it, the program is said to generate negative credit subsidy. The amount of money that loans insured in a given year actually earn for or cost the government over the course of their lifetime is likely to be different from the original credit subsidy estimates. Therefore, each year as part of the annual budget process, each prior year's credit subsidy rates are re-estimated based on the actual performance of the loans and other factors, such as updated economic projections. These re-ESTimates affect the way that funds are held in the MMI Fund's two primary accounts: the Financing Account and the Capital Reserve Account. The Financing account holds funds to cover expected future costs of FHAinsured loans. The Capital Reserve account holds additional funds to help cover any additional unexpected future costs. Funds are transferred between the two accounts each year on the basis of the re-estsimated credit subsidy rate to ensure that enough is held to cover updated projections of expected costs of insured loans. In addition, the Capital reserve account is used to pay claims to lenders for mortgages that have defaulted. The capital ratio is a measure of the amount of funds that would remain in the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) after all expected future cash flows on the loans that it currently insures have been realized, assuming that it did not insure any more loans going forward. Beginning in FY2009, and for several years thereafter, the capital ratio was estimated to be below the mandated 2% level. It again exceeded the 2% threshold in FY2015, when it was estimated at 2.07%. This represented an improvement from an estimated capital ratio of 0.41% at the end of FY2014, and from negative estimated capital ratios at the ends of FY2013 and FY2012. A low or negative capital ratio does not in itself trigger any special assistance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), but it raises concerns that the fund could need assistance in order to continue to hold enough funds in the Fin financing account to cover future losses.
The federal government has played an important role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies, from jet aircraft and the internet to communications satellites, shale gas extraction, and defenses against disease. In recent years, widespread concerns about the federal debt, recent and projected federal budget deficits, and federal budget caps have driven difficult decisions about the prioritization of federal research and development (R&D) both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal R& D portfolio. Increases in the budget caps for FY2018 and FY2019 reduced some of the pressure affecting these decisions, but the concerns remain and the caps have not been increased for FY2020. On March 11, 2019, President Trump released his proposed FY2020 budget. He provided additional details the following week. Completion of the FY2019 budget process on February 15,2019, more than four months after the start of FY2019, as well as a government shutdown, led to both a delay in the scheduled release of the President's FY 2020 budget request, and the use by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of a mix of estimated continuing appropriations act FY2019 funding levels (generally, for agencies whose FY2019 appropriations were enacted after the beginning of FY2018) and enacted FY2019 Funding levels. As a result, the aggregate (total) FY2019 R&d funding levels for all agencies in the Analytical Perspectives addendum to the FY2020 Budget are estimated "using FY 2019 enacted appropriations where available and annual Continuing Resolution [for agencies without enacted appropriations prior to Feb. 15, 2019]. With enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-6), OMB has not issued a document with comprehensive R&T figures for each agency or in aggregate. Therefore, the analysis of government-wide and agency-specific R & D funding in this report compares President Trump's FY2020 request for the Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Energy (DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), National Robotics Initiative (NRI), American Artificial Intelligence Initiative (AI), National Quantum Initiative (NAI), and other presidential initiatives without statutory foundations. As information about the agencies' FY2019 FY2020 appropriations levels becomes available, the agency sections of this report will be updated to reflect that information and make comparisons to President's Trump's request. The President's request includes $6.07 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in FY2020, $2.78 billion (31%) less than the total $8.85 billion FY2019 enacted appropriations for EPA (after rescissions) provided in Titles II and IV of Division E of the consolidated appropriations act, FY2019 (H.Rept.116-9) and $123.4 million (2%) below the FY2018 enacted level. The proposed reductions and eliminations of funding for FY 2020 are distributed across a number of EPA programs and activities, including proposed reductions in funding for scientific research programs. Reductions proposed in the FY 2020 request for EPA would be distributed across EPA operational functions and activities and grants for states, tribes, and local governments, although funding for some program areas within the accounts would remain constant or increase. The request would provide an increase (3.1%) for EPA's Science and Technology account, which funds much of the agency's scientific research activities, which include research conducted by the agency at its own laboratories and facilities, and research conducted at universities, foundations, and other nonfederal entities that receive EPA grants. The Administration is requesting $480.8 million for the S&T account in FY 2020, $241.1 million (33.4%) more than the $722.0 million provided in FY2019 and $11.3 million (11.7%) below FY2018. In addition, the Administration is proposing a rescission for EPA but does not specify a rescissions within the S &T or other appropriations accounts. This accounting difference does not allow for direct comparisons of funding within EPA's S & T account including specific rescissions. This report provides a more in-depth analysis of R&R in 12 federal departments and agencies that, in
Both the Capitol Rotunda and the Capitol Grounds have been used as the setting for a variety of events, ranging from memorial ceremonies and the reception of foreign dignitaries to the presentation of awards and the hosting of public competitions. Since the 101st Congress, concurrent resolutions have been agreed to by both the House and Senate to authorize the use of the Rotunda for a number of purposes. Since 1989, three award and dedication ceremonies have been authorized through concurrent resolutions: the dedication of the Japanese-American Memorial to Patriotism in 1999, the National World War II Memorial in 2003, and the Congressional Gold Medal awarded to Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, in 2007. In the 110th Congress, the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) was completed and opened, and Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of EmanCipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. Additionally, Congress has provided an ongoing authorization for holiday concerts on Capitol Grounds, held on Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day. These concerts feature the National Symphony Orchestra and are free and open to the public. This report identifies and categorizes the concurrent resolutions agreed to in each Congress that authorized the use by Congress of the Capitol grounds. It will be updated as needed to reflect future Congresses' action on concurrent resolutions for use of these grounds. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33476, The Capitol Grounds: Use of the U.S. Capitol Grounds by Congress, by [author name scrubbed] and [authority number scrubbed]. This report will not be updated to reflect any concurrent resolutions that were agreed to during the 115th Congress (2017-2018) or beyond. For further information on the Capitol, see the following CRS reports: CRS In Focus IF10101, The Rotunda: Concurrent Resolutions for the Use of The Capitol; CRS Issue Brief IB10102, Capitol Grounds and Rotunda Use by the Senate and House of Representatives: Concurrency Resolutions in the 111th, 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses (1989-2018); and CRS Reports RL33498, Capitol grounds: Use by Congress for Presidential Inauguration Ceremonies, Memorial Services, and Congressional Gold Medals Awards, and Artwork Unveilings (2017). This report is intended to assist Members of Congress and staff in their efforts to identify and categorize all concurrent resolutions authorized by Congress to use the Capitol and Capitol grounds since the 101th Congress.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates (principalities): Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich federation capital; Dubai, a large commercial hub; and the smaller and less wealthy emirate of Sharjah, Ajman, Fujayrah, Umm al-Qaywayn, and Ras al-Khaymah. The UAE is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and has close defense ties to the United States. The United States and the UAE have a "Defense Cooperation Framework" to develop joint strategic approaches to regional disputes and conflicts and to better integrate capabilities with those of the other GCC states. The framework includes UAE development of a defense plan that will facilitate joint U.S.-UAE planning in case of attack on the UAE. In accordance with the Framework, the two countries have established a "Joint Military Dialogue" (JMD) to identify shared security objectives and consult on a wide range of strategic issues. UAE leaders have stated that the country's end goal is not to form a multiparty system, arguing that this model does not correspond with UAE cultural or historical development. UAE officials maintain that Western-style political parties and elections for a legislature or other representative body would aggravate schisms among tribes and clans, cause Islamist factions to become radical, and open UAE politics to regional influence. Such assertions appear, at least in part, to signal that the UAE will work to prohibit the development of factions linked to regional Islamist movements or to regimes in the region. UAE law prohibits political parties, elections, and FNC elections; however, the UAE has provided for some formal popular representation through a 40-seat Federal National Council (FNC)—a body that can review and recommend, but not enact or veto, legislation. The FNC can question ministers and it conducts such questionings regularly. In 2006, the government instituted a limited election process for half of the FNC seats, with the other 20 seats remaining appointed. The first FNC vote was held on September 24, 2011, in the context of the "Arab spring" uprisings, with an expanded electorate (129,000), nearly half of which were female. There were 468 candidates for the 20 seats, including 85 women. However, there was little campaigning, and turnout was about 25%, which UAE officials called disappointing. Only one woman was elected (from Abu Dhabi), but another seven were given appointed seats. Of the 20 appointed seats, 6 were women. The 2015 elections were again for half the F NC, but the electorate was expanded to 225,000 voters, about double that in 2011. There was 330 candidates (somewhat lower than in 2011), including 74 women (almost as many as in 2011). Turnout was 35%, which government officials stated was a more satisfactory turnout. One woman waselected, as happened in 2011, and eight were appointed. Of those, one was promoted to speaker. The next FNC election is to be held in the fall of 2019. UAE government officials assert that there are plans to eventually make all 40 seats elected, but likely not in the 2019 vote. In December 2018, UAE leadership decreed that, as of the 2019 election, half of FNC members will be women – a quota presumably be achieved by appointing enough women to constitute half the body, after accounting for those elected. In recent years, there has been little evident clamor for major political reform, but some UAE intellectuals, businessmen, students, and others have agitated for greater political space. The government has particularly targeted for arrest Islamists linked to the Muslim Brotherhood organization, which UAE leaders named in 2014 as one of 85 "terrorist organizations" (a list that included Al Qaeda and the Islamic State). The UAE affiliate of the Brotherhood is the Islah (Reform) organization. In June 2014, 30 persons, of which 20 are Egyptian nationals, were convicted for connections to theMuslim Brotherhood organization in Egypt. A Saudi-UAE list of "persons to be isolated," released in connection with the June 2017 intra-GCC dispute, included Muslim Brotherhood-linked Egyptian cleric Yusuf Qaradawi, who resides in Qatar. The disagreements between Qatar and the Emirates and other GCC countries over the Muslim Brothers and other political Islamist movements are discussed further in the section on foreign policy. This report will be updated as events warrant.
Marijuana is a variety of the Cannabis sativa plant, and contains hundreds of chemical compounds. Two significant compounds found in marijuana are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound, and cannabidiol (CBD); CBD is being tested for medicinal purposes, and is not itself psychoactive. Marijuana use has been recorded for millennia. In the 20th century, the sale, possession, and use of marijuana were made illegal in most countries, including the United States. In recent years, however, the trend appears to be moving toward acceptance of marijuana usage. In public opinion polls, the percentage of Americans favoring legalization of marijuana has increased significantly. As of May 2019, 33 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws legalizing marijuana use under certain conditions, generally for medicinal or medical purposes. Since Colorado and Washington State legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, the number of states in which recreational use is permitted has grown to 10. These jurisdictions are home to one-quarter of the U.S. population. In addition to states that have legalized recreational use, another 23 states and Puerto Rico allow marijuana to be used for treating medical conditions ("medical marijuana"). Several other states are considering legalizing recreational use ofarijuana. The number of people who self-report using marijuana has grown slowly but steadily since 2008, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's annual survey of substance use among individuals ages 12 and older. In 2017, self-reported marijuana usage by young adults (ages 18-25) rose from 16.6% to 22.1% between 2008 and 2017. Self-reported use among adults age 26 and older rose from 4.2% to 7.9% over the same period. This study does not break out usage patterns by state, but other studies have found that reported usage has increased in virtually all states, both in those that have loosened restrictions on marijuana usage and those that haven't. Thus, the impact of a state's treatment of marijuana on the extent of marijuana use is not clear. Some observers have speculated that loosening restrictions on usage might lead to increased usage. But the fact that usage by adults appears to have increased in both states that loosened the restrictions suggests that other factors may also be involved. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has sponsored a periodic roadside survey of alcohol use among drivers for decades. The last two surveys (2007 and 2013-2014) also looked at drug use. In 2013- 2014, 12.7% of drivers in the nighttime sample tested positive for THC, up from 8.7%. NHTSA did not report concentrations of THC and did not attempt to evaluate impairment. The data do not permit state-level comparisons. The results of these surveys do not allow for comparisons of marijuana and alcohol usage. The relationship between marijuana usage, and the likelihood of being involved in a crash, is not well established. The research literature on marijuana's effect on driver performance has been limited, in part because of the difficulty of determining whether marijuana usage is linked to a crash. In a 2017 report, the National Academy of Sciences concluded that there is "substantial evidence of a statistical association between cannabis use and increased risk of motor vehicle crashes." However, the association between marijuana use and crash risk is not yet well established, in large part due to the difficulty in determining the role of other factors in causing a crash (e.g., alcohol, other drugs, fatigue, and emotional states).
The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG), also known as fire grants or the FIRE Act grant program, was established by Title XVII of the FY2001 Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 106-398). Currently administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the program provides federal grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organizations to help address a variety of equipment, training, and other firefighter-related and EMS needs. AFG also supports fire prevention projects and firefighter health and safety research and development through the Firefighter Prevention and Safety (FP&S) grant program. The AFG program has been reauthorized three times since its establishment. The first reauthorization was Title XXXVI of theFY2005 Ronald W. Reagan National Defense authorization Act, which authorized the program through FY2009. Title XVIII, Subtitle A, the Fire Grants Reauthorization Act of 2012, was signed into law on January 2, 2013, and authorized the AFG and SAFER programs through FY2017 and made significant changes in how grant money would be disbursed. The United States Fire Administration, AFG, and Safe and Accountable Emergency Response (SAFER) Program Reauthorizations Act of 2017, P. l. 115-98, was passed by the Senate on August 2, 2017, and the House on September 14, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3354) provided $345 million for AFG in FY2018 and $365 million for SAFER in FY2019. For FY2018, the Administration requested $688.688 million for firefighter assistance. The House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the Homeland Security appropriations bill for FY2018 on July 18, 2018. The bill provided $690 million in firefighter assistance, including $344.344 million forAFG and $350 million in SAFER. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to S. 3109, the Departmentof Homeland Security Act, 2019, which would have provided $700 million for fire assistance in FY2020. The Senate bill would have funded AFG at its FY2020 level, while SAFER would have received its FY2023 level. On July 25, 2018 and July 26, the House approved their versions of the DHS appropriations bills for FY2019, including a total of $688 billion for FY2025 and FY2028, respectively. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants.
The current legal landscape governing data protection in the United States is complex and highly technical, but so too are the legal issues implicated by proposals to create unified federal data protection policy. Except in extreme incidents and cases of government access to personal data, the "right to privacy" that developed in the common law and constitutional doctrine provide few safeguards for the average internet user. Although Congress has enacted a number of laws designed to augment individual's data protection rights, the current patchwork of federal law generally is limited to specific industry, specific types of data, or data practices that are unfair or deceptive. This patchwork approach also extends to certain state laws. Seeking a more comprehensive data protection system, some governments—such as California and the European Union (EU)—have enacted wide-ranging laws regulating many forms of personal data. Some argue that Congress should consider creating similar federal protections in law, but others have criticized the EU's and California's approach to data protection. Should the 116th Congress consider a comprehensive federal data Protection program, its legislative proposals may involve numerous decision points and legal considerations. An initial decision point is the scope and nature of any legislative proposal. There are numerous data protection issues that could be addressed in any future future legislation, and different possible approaches for addressing those issues (such as using a "prescriptive" or "outcome-based" approach). Other decision points may include a discussion of how to define the contours of the data that the federal government proposes to protect or the specific entities or industries that it proposes to regulate. Another key issue to consider is how to address statutory overlap between existing federal data laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), as well as the laws of the states. Finally, Congress may have to confront possible limitations imposed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The First Amendment guarantees, among other rights, "freedom of speech." Although Congress may not be able to legislate around these constitutional constraints, future legislation could address some of these limitations—for example, by allowing the FTC to seek penalties for first-time violations of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. This report provides a brief overview of the legal framework governing the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information in the digital data privacy sphere. It also discusses some of the issues that Congress may choose to consider when crafting any future national data protection legislation. The Appendix to this report contains a table summarizing the federal dataprotection laws discussed in this report.
Review of Clean Air Act regulations issued under the Obama Administration, with the possibility of their modification or repeal, has been a major focus of the Trump Administration since it took office in 2017. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has conducted these reviews as part of the Administration's "regulatory reform" initiative, under which the Administration has directed federal agencies to evaluate existing regulations and identify those that should be considered for replacement, repeal, or modification. EPA rules to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants, cars and trucks, and the oil and gas sector have been of particular interest. EPA's GHG regulations have focused on six gases or groups of gases that multiple scientific studies have linked to climate change. Of the six gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), which is produced by combustion of fossil fuels and is the most prevalent, accounts for about 80% of annual emissions of the combined group when measured as CO2 equivalents. Since 2007, the Supreme Court has ruled on two separate occasions that the CAA, as amended, authorizes EPA to set standards for GHG emissions. In the first case, Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court held that GHGs are air pollutants and that EPA must regulate their emissions from motor vehicles if the agency finds that such emissions cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Following the Court's decision, in 2009, the agency made an endangerment finding. The second case, American Electric Power, Inc. v. Connecticut, held that corporations cannot be sued for GHGs under federal common law, because the Cleanair Act delegates the management of carbon dioxide and other GHGs to EPA: "... Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions fromPower plants; the delegation is what displaces federal common Law." EPA's Clean Power Plan (CPP) would set state-specific goals for CO2 emissions or emission rates from existing fossil-fueled power plants. The CPP has been stayed by the Supreme court since February 2016, pending the completion of judicial review. In addition, EPA's New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new and modified power plants would affect fewer plants, but they too are controversial, because of the technology the rule assumed could be used to reduce emissions at new coal-fired units. As promulgated in 2015, the NSPS would have relied in part on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology, which would have reduced emissions by about 20% compared to the emissions of a state-of-the-art power plant without CCS. Critics stated that CCS is a costly and unproven technology, and because of this, theNSPS would effectively have prohibited the construction of newcoal-fired plants. (The first commercial CCS facility in the United States, the Petra Nova project at the W.A. Parish Generating Station in Texas, came on line in 2016.) The NSPS and the CPP have also been challenged in court. In October 2017, EPA proposed a rule to repeal and replace them (the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule) on August 21, 2018. The ACE rule would apply a narrower interpretation of the best system of emission reduction (BSER), defining it as on-site heat rate improvements for existing coal- fired units. The agency also proposed two additional actions in the ACE rule—one to revise regulations that implement the Clean Energy Act (CEA) Section 111(d) and another to modify an applicability determination for a CAA preconstruction permitting program for new or modified stationary sources, known as New Source Review (NSR). The former seeks to codify EPA's current legal interpretation that states have broad discretion to establish emission standards consistent with BSER. The latter would revise the NSR applicability test for certain power plants and, according to EPA, prevent NSR from discouraging the installation of energy-efficiency measures. EPA also proposed to revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM) in December 2018, but the agency has not yet finalized the rule. EPA is reviewing the benefit-cost analysis it prepared in 2011 for the Mercury and Air Toxics (MATS) rule, raising questions about whether the agency will take additional action on the rulemaking in 2019. As of this writing, the MATS rule remains in effect and litigation remains on hold, at the agency's
The federal government is funded annually by a combination of regular appropriations acts and continuing resolutions (CRs). The interval during a fiscal year when appropriations for a particular project or activity are not enacted into law, either in the form of a regular appropriations act or a CR, is referred to as a funding gap or funding lapse. Funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year, but they may also occur any time a CR expires and another CR (or the relevant regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. The most recent funding gaps occurred in FY1996, FY2014, FY2018, and FY2019. The FY1996 funding gap lasted from December 15, 1995, through January 6, 1996, when the first of a series of CRs was enacted. The first of these, P.L. 115-90, extended funding through December 22, 1995. The second and third CRs extended funding until January 19, 1996. The fourth and final CR expired at midnight on January 19. The funding gap for FY2014 commenced at the beginning of FY2014 on October 1, 2013. On September 30, 2013, an amendment to H.R. 2775, which had been previously passed by the House on September 12 with an amendment, provided interim continuing appropriations for the previous year's programs and activities through January 15, 2014. The CR was signed into law on October 17, 2013 (P. l. 113-39, 113th Congress). The gap in funding for FY2018 began on December 8, 2017, when no regular appropriations bills were enacted, and ended on January 22, 2018, when a CR was enacted to fund the federal government through January 22. The gap began with the expiration of the fourth CR, H.J.Res. 91, which provided funding for the Department of Defense (DOD) and other specified DOD and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contractors through January 20, 2018. In FY2019, 5 of the 12 regular appropriations measures had been enacted in two consolidated appropriations bills. The remaining 7 regular bills were funded under two CRs. When no agreement was reached on legislation to further extend the period of these CRs, the funding gap began at the end of December 2018. Because of this funding gap, federal agencies and activities funded in these seven regular appropriations legislation were required to shut down for 34 full days. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33498, Federal Government Operations During a Funding Gap, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10130, Funding Gaps in the 113th and 114th Congresses: History and Current Issues.
The United States and Jordan have cooperated on a number of regional and international issues for decades. Jordan's small size and lack of major economic resources have made it dependent on aid from Western and various Arab sources. U.S. support, in particular, has helped Jordan deal with serious vulnerabilities, both internal and external. The United States has provided economic and military aid to Jordan since 1951 and 1957, respectively, and Jordan is the third-largest recipient of annual U. S. foreign aid globally, after Afghanistan and Israel. Through FY2017, total bilateral aid (overseen by the Departments of State and Defense) to Jordan through FY2017 amounted to approximately $20.4 billion. Jordan also has received hundreds of millions in additional military aid since FY2014 channeled through the Defense Department's various security assistance accounts. Since assuming the throne from his late father on February 7, 1999, King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein has maintained Jordan's stability and strong ties to the United States. Despite this resilience, Jordanians are becoming increasingly restless over economic conditions, corruption, and the lack of political reform. In 2018, real GDP growth was 2.8%, while unemployment stood at 18.5%, and was likely much higher among young workers. Weekly protests have been recurring in Amman, though they have not been as large as summer 2018 protests over tax hikes. Additionally, many Jordanians have turned to social media to express their dissatisfaction with the status quo; the kingdom has one of the highest worldwide rates of social media usage among emerging economies. In recent months, the king has taken a multifaceted approach for responding to public discontent. For example, he has made several public appearances without a security detail, probably in an effort to increase his visibility and interaction with the population. The king also has decided to televise the trial of those accused in the cigarette scandal—a rarity in Jordan's justice system. The government also has withdrawn controversial amendments to the 2015 cybercrime law, which would have seriously curtailed freedom of expression online. In addition to addressing public discontent and bolstering nationalist sentiment at home by stoking tensions with Israel in support of the Palestinian cause, Jordan has also taken steps to bolster its relations with its neighbors, such as expanding the membership of the Islamic Waqf Council (Islamic custodial trust), which Jordan appoints to oversee the administration of Jerusalem's Temple Mount (known by Muslims as the Haram al Sharif or Noble Sanctuary) and its holy sites. The newly expanded council immediately defied a 16-year Israeli ban on Muslim worship at the Bab al Rahma building on the Temple Mount. Israel responded by arresting worshippers and activists while also temporarily banning several leaders of the council from accessing the temple. In March 2019, Kingdullah II spoke in the industrial city of Zarqa, where he stated, "To me, Jerusalem is a red line, and all my people are with me.... No one can pressure Jordan on this matter, andthe answer will be no. All Jordanians stand with me on Jerusalem." The king's government has limited financial options for addressing discontent. Although the government has continued to work with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on fiscal reforms, public debt has ballooned to 95% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and most of the government's budget is dedicated to salaries, pensions, and debt servicing, leaving few additional options to fund public sector job programs. In the face of growing public discontent, the Jordanian government has proposed a new draft tax bill that would raise personal and family exemptions for the poorest citizens. It also would have raised corporate taxes on banks and reclassified tax evasion as a felony rather than a misdemeanor. In late May 2018, as the bill drew closer to passage and after an IMF team visited Jordan to review its economic reform plan, demonstrations began across the country. Large-scale demonstrations continued for two more days, and on June 7 the government announced that it was withdrawing the bill from immediate consideration and sending it back to parliament for revision.
The U.S. and Afghan governments, along with partner countries, remain engaged in combat with a robust Taliban-led insurgency. By some measures, insurgents are in control of or contesting more territory today than at any point since 2001. The conflict also involves an array of other armed groups, including active affiliates of both Al Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIS, ISIL, or by the Arabic acronym Da'esh). Since early 2015, the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, known as "Resolute Support Mission" (RSM), has focused on training, advising, and assisting Afghan government forces; combat operations by U. S. counterterrorism forces and some partner forces also continue. These two "complementary missions" make up Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS). Simultaneously, the United States is engaged in an aggressive diplomatic effort to end the war, most notably through direct talks with Taliban representatives. A draft framework, in which the Taliban would prohibit terrorist groups from operating on Afghan soil in return for the eventual withdrawal of U. s. forces, was reached between U.s. and Taliban negotiators in January 2019, though lead U.N. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad insists that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed." The Afghan government, which is led by President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Abdullah Abdullah, has encountered challenges but remains intact. It held parliamentary elections in October 2018 that were marred by logistical, administrative, and security problems; results are still, as of May 2019, incomplete, though the new parliament was inaugurated in April 2019. The all-important presidential election, originally scheduled for April 2019, has now been postponed twice, until September 2019. It is unclear to what extent, if any, those delays are related to ongoing U.K.-Taliban talks. The United States has contributed approximately $133 billion in various forms of aid to Afghanistan over the past decade and a half, from building up and sustaining the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) to economic development. This assistance has increased Afghan government capacity, but prospects for stability in Afghanistan appear distant. Some U.L. policymakers still hope that the country's largely underdeveloped natural resources and/or geographic position at the crossroads of future global trade routes might improve the economic life of the country, and, by extension, its social and political dynamics as well. Nevertheless, Afghanistan's economic and political outlook remains uncertain, if not negative, in light of ongoing hostilities. Afghanistan's political situation is a major complicating factor for current negotiations. The leadership partnership (referred to as the national unity government) between President Ghani, who took office in September 2014, and CEO Abdullah Abdullah has encountered some challenges but has remained intact. However, a trend in Afghan society and governance that worries some observers is increasing political fragmentation along ethnic lines. Such fractures have long existed in Afghanistan but were relatively muted during President Hamid Karzai's presidency. These divisions are sometimes seen as a driving force behind some of the political upheavals that have challenged Ghani's government. In the past two years, however, the Afghan government has made some progress in reducing corruption and implementing its budgetary commitments, but faces domestic criticism for its failure to guarantee security and prevent insurgent gains. In addition, some observers have expressed concern that the Afghan political system may not be ready for a negotiated settlement with the Taliban, which has long refused to negotiate with representatives of the government of Afghanistan, which they characterize as a corrupt and illegitimate puppet of foreign powers. In August 2017, President Trump announced what he termed a new South Asia strategy in a nationally-televised address that included a modest increase in the number of troops and increased pressure on Pakistan. In July 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly ordered the start of direct peace talks with the Afghan Taliban that did not include the government. This represented a dramatic reversal of policy, which had previously been to support an "Afghan-led, Afghan-owned" peace process. In January 2018, the Trump Administration announced plans to suspend security assistance to Pakistan, a decision that has affected billions of dollars in aid.
Cyprus gained its independence from Great Britain in 1960. The Republic of Cyprus is divided between the Greek Cypriot community in the north and the Turkish Cypriots in the south. In 1974, Turkey deployed military forces to the island in two separate actions, taking control of more than one-third of the island by August 1974. This military intervention had many ramifications. Foremost was the physical separation of the Island; widespread dislocation of both the Greek and the Turks populations and related governance, refugee, and property problems; and what the GreekCypriots refer to as the continued occupation of the Islands. After the conflict subsided and a fragile peace took root, TurkishCypriot leaders pursued a solution to the conflict that would keep the two communities separate in two states under the government of either a confederation or a stronger central federal government. Negotiations for a final solution appeared to take a dramatic and positive step forward on November 11, 2002, when then-U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented a draft of a settlement plan to the two sides. However, the plan was rejected by both sides and the United Nations, the European Union (EU), and the guarantor powers, including Greece and Turkey, as well as Cyprus's long-time ally, Cyprus Republic President Nicos Anastasiades. In 2004, after numerous meetings and negotiations, and despite a lack of a firm agreement but sensing that further negotiations would produce little else, Annan released his "final revised plan" and announced that the plan would be put to referenda simultaneously in both north and south Cyprus on April 24, 2004. The plan, which he himself opposed at the time, was subsequently rejected by 76% of Greek Cy Cyprus voters and accepted by 65% of Turkish Cyprus. In 2005, Demetris Christofias, elected president of the Republic of Cyprios in February 2008, and Turkish Cyprus leader Yiannis Talat, elected "president" of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) in April 2005, agreed to resume negotiations. After almost two years, however, in April 2010, Talat lost his reelection bid and was replaced by Dervis Eroglu of the National Unity Party (UBP), a party that advocated a permanently divided island and international recognition for the TRNC. Under the auspices of the U.N., the parties resumed the negotiations in May 2010, but the talks failed to produce a final agreement in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In 2016, the two leaders agreed to try to reach a settlement by the end of 2016, but failed to reach an agreement in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 2017, and again in June 2017. In July 2017, both sides agreed to hold a new conference in Crans Montana, Montana, with the purpose of finalizing an agreement on security guarantees and territory. The talks collapsed on July 7, 2017, after little progress was made. In an attempt to break the stalemate, in July 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Antonio Guterres appointed a special adviser to Cyprus, Jane Holl Lute, to consult with both sides on the future of the Cyprus problem and to determine if sufficient conditions existed for the negotiations to resume. Lute apparently found some positive aspects but no clear indication that either side was ready to resume the negotiations. In mid-October 2018, AnastASades and Akinci agreed to meet informally to discuss the possible road ahead. After Lute concluded her second round of consultations with all parties in mid-December 2018, it apparently became clear that no agreement had been reached and that negotiations were unlikely to resume anytime soon. In early 2019, Lute returned to Cyprus for yet another round of meetings with both leaders. When she returned in April, she apparently found both sides seemingly farther apart. A major sticking point was Akinci's demand that if a solution would result in two equal constituent states, under a federal structure, then the Turkish Cyprus should hold equal power on issues taken up at the federal level that would involve both constituent states. The idea was again rejected by Anastaseasades, and Lute found little basis for continuing her consultations and decided to meet with the guarantors on security issues. In late April 2019, the parties agreed to continue their consultations on security, but Lute saw no likely breakthrough, and she agreed to return to Cyprus in early May to continue her consultations.
This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. A total of 35 LCSs have been procured through FY2019. The Navy wants FY2019 to be the final year of LCS procurement, and it has not requested the procurement of any additional LCSs in its FY2020 budget submission. The LCS program has been controversial over the years due to past cost growth, design and construction issues with the first LCSs, concerns over the survivability of LCSs (i.e., their ability to withstand battle damage), concerns over whether LCSs are sufficiently armed and would be able to perform their stated missions effectively, and concerns about the development and testing of the modular mission packages for LCSs. Congress has oversight responsibility for the LCS program, and its execution has been a matter of congressional oversight attention for several years, particularly for a period of about 10 years starting around 2007, when significant cost growth in the program came to light. A broad oversight area for Congress for theLCS program for the past several years concerns survivability, lethality, technical risk, and test and evaluation issues relating to LCSs and their mission packages. Congress also has oversight concerns over future workloads and employment levels at the two LCS shipyards if one or both of these shipyards are not involved in building a new frigate called the Navy Frigate (FFG(X) in FY2020. Congress's decisions on the LCS Program will affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the LCS and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke. This report will be updated as events warrant. For additional information on the manning and deployment of the LCS, see Appendix A, and Appendix B. For a discussion of the potential for LCS sales to foreign buyers, see the following CRS reports: CRS In Focus IF10101, Navy Littoran Combat Ship: Potential Foreign Sales, by [author name scrubbed] and CRS Issue Brief IB10110, Navy LCS: Potential Sales to Foreign Buyers, by (1) the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and (2) the Navy. For more information on other Navy ships, see GAO Report R44405, Navy's Small Surface Combatant (SSC) Program: Overview and Analysis of Selected Programs, by John Defterios. For information on a Navy frigate program that the Navy wants to replace the LCS with, the Navy is currently in the process of selecting a design for the FFG[X]. The Navy plans to announce the winner of this FFG( X) competition in the fourth quarter of FY2020, and to begin procuring that design in FY2021.
Streamgages measure water level and related streamflow at streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs across the country. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Department of the Interior's (DOI's) lead scientific agency, manages the USGS Streamgaging Network. The network encompasses 10,300 streamgages that record water height or streamflow for at least a portion of the year. Approximately 8,200 of these streamgage year-round and are part of the National Streamflow Network. This subnetwork includes 3,640 Federal Priority Streamgages (FPSs), which Congress and the US GS designated as national priorities. Congressional appropriations and agreements with approximately 1,400 nonfederal partners funded this network at $189.5 million in FY2018. The USGS is required to operate no less than 4,700 FPSs by FY2019 under the SECURE Water Act of 2009 (Title IX, Subtitle F of P.L. 111-11). In FY2018, the US Geological Survey's share of funding for FPSs was $24.7 million, and its share for CMF was $29.8 million. Other federal agencies and nonf federal partners, mostly affiliated with the CMF program, funded the rest of the network. In FY2019, Congress directed the USGC to invest in the Next Generation Water Observing System (NextGen) system, which is intended to replace the current streamgaging network. The NextGen system is expected to provide data on water levels and streamflow in ungagged or sparsely gaged basins. The President's budget request for FY2020 proposes a restructuring of the mission area to create a new program that would combine the Streamgage Network and other water observation programs. The FY2020 budget requests $105.1 million for the proposed program, a decrease of $7.5 billion from FY2018 funding for a similar structure. The budget request would maintain funding for active FPS locations and provide no funding for the Next Gen system. For CMF, the request proposes a decrease in funding of $500,000 for Tribal Water, which would result in a loss of $250,000 of CMF streamgaged funding, and $717,000 in funding for Urban Waters Federal Partnership, which will reduce water quality monitoring at select streams. Congress has supported a national streamgage program for 130 years. These streamgage programs operate in every state, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Puerto Rico and Guam; therefore, national stream mortgage operations garner interest from many Members of Congress. Streamgage data is used for a wide range of applications, including supporting activities of federal agencies, state and local water management agencies, utility companies, and recreationists. Some stakeholders have advocated for more federal funding to expand the network, while others have proposed increasing nontraditional funding sources, such as businesses, homeowner associations, non-for-profit organizations, academic institutions, and other non-federal entities. Congress may consider funding levels and policy priorities for the network as it considers the future direction of the program. Congress also may consider whether to maintain, decrease, or expand the number of streamgage sites, and whether to fund streamgage restoration and modernization.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), under the authority of Congress as enunciated in periodic farm legislation, provides support to the farm economy through a variety of federal farm programs. Direct support can often involve the transfer of billions of dollars each year. For example, USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) outlays on farm support programs have averaged $13.7 billion per year from 1996 through 2017. Program payments vary across commodities and regions as well as by size of farm operations. This variation has generated considerable interest—by both the general public and Congress—in who is eligible to participate in farm programs and, thus, may receive payments. The concern over program eligibility also derives, in part, from instances where farm payments have accrued to individuals who have never engaged in farming. A number of statutory and regulatory requirements govern federal farm program eligibility for benefits under various programs. A key aspect of eligibility for major farm revenue support programs is the requirement that a person be "actively engaged in farms" (AEF)—that is, that the person contribute either labor or management time (or both) to a farm operation. AEF criteria are a required component of eligibility to receive payments under the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) programs and benefits under the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program. In addition, two direct payment programs established by the Secretary of Agriculture require that payment recipients meet all AEF eligibility criteria—the Cotton Ginning Cost-Share program and the Market Facilitation Program. Finally, benefits under Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers also require that participants meet AEF requirements. In general, family farms receive special treatment in which every adult family member 18 years or older who receives income based on the farm's operating results is deemed to meet the AEF requirement. In the case of a joint operation, the amount of farm payments that can be earned in a year depends on the number of qualifying members and their ownership share. Each partner or member with an ownership interest must contribute active personal labor and/or active personal management to the farming operation (but subject to certain exemptions, such as the spousal and landlord exceptions listed above). A nonfamily member of a farming operation is, by default, anyone who does not meet the criteria of family membership. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79, §1604) required USDA to add more specificity to the role that a nonfamily producer who is a members of a legal entity—primarily a partnership or joint venture—must play to qualify for farm program benefits. As a result, the current set of laws and rules governing farm eligibility—particularly for family members of an operation—remain subject to considerable scrutiny and criticism from both rural and farm advocacy groups and certain Members of Congress. Critics contend that current USDA eligibility criteria remain broad and subjective and may represent a low threshold to qualify, thus facilitating the creation of partnership members to increase the farm business's payment limit and expand its farm payment receipts. In response to these concerns, USDA issued a rule in December 2015 that, among other things, clarified the definition of what constitutes a "significant contribution" of "active personal management" for the purpose of payment eligibility. However, long-standing concerns remain that some farm operations are organized to overcome program payment limits and maximize the amounts of their farm program payments. In particular, some advocacy groups suggest that USDA's new rule did not go far enough in tightening program eligibility criteria and that it continues to allow for a high number of farm managers and associated payment limits for both family and nonfamily operations. Furthermore, critics contend that, under the current monitoring system, it can be difficult for USDA to verify the management claims of farm operation partners. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has said that the three principal hindrances to USDA oversight and enforcement of AEF regulations for members of farming operations that claim AEF compliance by providing activepersonal management: (1) the definition is broad and can be interpreted to include many potential activities, (2) requirements of what constitute significant contributions of management are subjective, and (3) it is difficult to verify individuals' evidence of claimed contributions of active personal Management and personal labor—often depending on interviews with individual payment recipients.
In March 2015, after President Hadi, who had fled to Saudi Arabia, appealed for international intervention, Saudi Arabia and a hastily assembled international coalition launched a military offensive aimed at restoring Hadi's rule and evicting Houthi fighters from the capital and other major cities. Saudi-led coalition forces began conducting air strikes against Houthi-Saleh forces and imposed strict limits on sea and air traffic to Yemen. In the years since, the Saudi military and its coalition partners have provided advice and military support to a range of pro-Hadi forces inside Yemen, while waging a persistent air campaign against the Houthis and their allies. Saudi ground forces and Special Forces have conducted limited cross-border operations, and Saudi naval forces limit the entry and exit of vessels from Yemen's ports. According to President Trump's December 2018 letter to Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, U.S. Armed Forces, "in a non-combat role," continued to provide military advice and limited information, logistics, and other support to regional forces combatting the Houthi insurgency in Yemen; however, aerial refueling of regional forces' aircraft ended in November 2018. The United States has also sustained counterterrorism operations against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and various affiliates of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Yemen. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that two-thirds of the population is food insecure, one-third are suffering from extreme levels of hunger, and 230 out of Yemen's 333 districts were at risk of famine as of January 2019. In February 2019, the United Nations and the Governments of Sweden and Switzerland hosted the third annual pledging conference for the crisis in Yemen in Geneva, where the United States and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) each pledged $750 million. For 2019, OCHA is seeking $4 billion from donors for programs in Yemen, including $2.5 billion in emergency humanitarian assistance and $3 billion in long-term development assistance. In addition to the humanitarian crisis, Yemen is experiencing the world's largest ongoing cholera outbreak. Since late 2016, there have been more than 1.3 million suspected cases and nearly 2,800 associated deaths. The conflict has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis that began in 2011, when a civil war broke out in Yemen following the ouster of then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh in a popular uprising against his decades-long rule. Since then, Yemen has been beset by multiple political conflicts and violence. In December 2018, the warring parties to the conflict agreed to a cease-fire around the port city of Hudaydah, a prisoner swap, and a statement of understanding that all sides would form a committee to discuss the war-torn city Taiz. However, implementation of the agreement has been hindered by a lack of trust and a reluctance on the part of the parties to make operational concessions outside of a comprehensive political agreement. In January 2019, a Houthi militia known as the Al Qaeda-linked Huthi Ansarullah (Houthis) group launched an attack against the government of the UAE-backed government of Yemen in the port of Hodeidah. The Houthis seized control of the capital of Sanaa in 2015, and since then have been fighting a coalition of Yemeni forces led by the UAE and Saudi Arabia for control of several other cities, including Sanaa and the partially Houthis-besieged city of Taiz, Yemen's third-largest city. In March 2018, Houthi militants took over Sanaa, and in December 2018 the coalition began a ground offensive against Houthis in the city. Although fighting has continued along several fronts since December, the Stockholm Agreement has provided the coalition with the possibility of gradually extricating itself from its intervention in Yemen by providing for a broader, nation-wide cease- fire. The longer it takes to implement the agreement, however, the greater the risk of its collapse and the prospect of renewed conflict in HudayDah. In 2019, U.-N. officials have reported to the Security Council that the parties have made "significant progress towards an agreement to implement phase one of the redeployments of the Hudayda agreement" but have yet to reach agreement on the identities of local police forces to take over security in the Yemeni port city. The Stockholm Agreement did not specify which local actors were to assume responsibility for security after both parties redeployed. U.
This report provides background information and potential oversight issues for Congress on war-related and other international emergency or contingency-designated funding since FY2001. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated for emergencies or Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure includes $1.8 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD), $154 billion for the Departments of State and USAID, and $3 billion for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Coast Guard (see Figure 1). This CRS report is meant to serve as a reference on certain funding designated as emergency requirement or for OCO or GWOT, as well as related budgetary and policy issues. It does not provide an estimate of war costs within the OCO/ GWOT account (all of which may not be for activities associated with war or defense) or such costs in the DOD base budget or other agency funding (which may be related to war activities, such as the cost of health care for combat veterans). Congress may consider one or more supplemental appropriations bills (colloquially called supplementals) for a fiscal year to provide funding for unforeseen needs (such as a response to a national security threat or a natural disaster), or to increase appropriations for other activities that have already been funded. Supplemental appropriations measures generally provide additional funding for selected activities over and above the amount provided through annual or continuing appropriations. During the post-9/11 conflicts, primarily conducted in Afghanistan and Iraq but also in other countries, Congress have, for an extended period and to a much greater degree than in previous conflicts in the 20th century, appropriated supplemental and specially designated funding over andabove the base DOD budget—that is, funding for planned or regularly occurring costs to man, train, and equip the military force. Since FY2001, DOD funding designated for O CO/GWO has averaged 17% of the department's total budget authority. In FY2019, DOD's OCO funding totaled $68.8 billion, or 10% of its discretionary spending. The President's initial FY2019 budget request included $89 billion in OCO funds for FY2019. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in collaboration with DOD, in September 2010, issued criteria for the department to use in making war/overseas contingency operations funding requests. These criteria include the combat losses of ground vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment; replenishment of munitions expended in combat operations; facilities and infrastructure in the theater of operations; transport of personnel, equipment, and supplies to and from the theater; among other items and activities. In addition, the President's FY2019 OCO request included funding for the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), an effort to increase the number of military personnel and prepositioned equipment in Central and Eastern Europe intended in part to reassure NATO allies after Russia's military seized Crimea in Crimea in 2014. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123) raised the discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011, which applies to defense and nondefense discretionary spending for FY2020 and FY2021, by $85 billion, from $562 billion to $647 billion and $68 billion, respectively, for FY2018 and FY2019 (the most recent full-year appropriations for DOD and other agencies). The BCA also included a provision to exempt certain types of discretionary spending from the statutory limits on discretionary spending, including OCO and GWOT funding. As a result, Congress and the President can effectively continue to increase topline defense, foreign affairs, and related discretionary spending without triggering sequestration. Some defense officials and policymakers say OCO provides a political and fiscal safety valve to the BCA caps and threat of sequestration, enabling a flexible and timely response to emergencies or contingency operations. They say if OCO were not used in such a manner and discretionary spending Limits remained in place, DOD and others would be forced to cut base budgets and revise strategic priorities. Critics, including Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, have described OCO as a "slush fund" for military and foreign affairs spending unrelated to contingency operations and described the use of O
The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides monthly updates of the employment status of the nation's veterans. The BLS reports that as of January 2019, there were about 19.0 million veterans. There were 9.4 million veterans in the civilian labor force (i.e., they were either employed or unemployed and available for work, except for temporary illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment sometime during the four-week period ending with the reference week). In recent years, the unemployment rate among veterans as a whole has generally been lower than the unemployment rates for nonveterans 18 years and older. However, veterans who have left the military since September 2001 have experienced higher unemployment than other veterans and, in some years, higher than nonve veteranans as well. In January 2018, the unemployed unemployment rate for veterans was 3.7%, which was higher than for veterans who left theMilitary prior to September 2001 (3.3%), and for veteranswho left the Military since September2001 (4.2%). Veterans who have Left the Military Since September 2001 also have a higher labor force participation rate (78.0%) than veterans aged 18 and older (62.7%) and other veterans (40.0%). In addition, in January 2017, the BLS reported that about 9.2% of nonfarm firms in the United States (2.54 million of 27.62 million) were owned by veterans in 2012. Four states had more than 100,000 veteran-owned firms: California (254,873), Texas (215,217), Florida (187,074), New York (138,670), and Texas (214,217). In 2012, 82.3% of veteran- owned, nonfarm businesses had no paid employees and 17.7% had paid employees. This ratio is similar to comparable national figures of 80.4% (22.20 million) with no paid workers and 19.6% (5.42 million) of paid workers. 84.3%, 15.1%,384,549, and 0.6%, respectively, were owned equally by a male and a female. Veteran-owned employer firms employed 5.5 million persons (about 4.8% of total U. S. employment); reported a total payroll of $220.8 billion ( about 4.2%) in 2012; generated $1.375 trillion in total sales/receipts (about four.2%), and had an average sales/Receipt of $3.1 million. Veteran owned nonemployer firms generated 6.4%, $94.5 billion (6.4%) of the $94 billion in sales/ Revenues generated by these firms. The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small business owners and prospective entrepreneurs. For example, it provides education programs to assist with business formation and expansion; loan guaranty programs to enhance small businesses' access to capital; and programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting, including oversight of the service-disabled veteran-ownership small business federal procurement goaling program. The SBA also provides direct loans for owners of businesses of all sizes, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters. The Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL) program is also of interest to veterans. It provides loans of up to $2 million to small business Owners who are not able to obtain credit elsewhere to meet ordinary and necessary operating expenses that they could have met but are not unable to because an essential employee has been called up to active duty in his or her role as a military reservist or member of the National Guard due to a period of military conflict. In FY2018, the SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development (OVBD) received an appropriation of $12.7 million for FY2018. This report provides a brief overview of veterans' employment experiences and examines, in greater detail, SBA veteran business development programs. It also describes employment assistance programs offered by several federal agencies to assist veterans transitioning from the military to the civilian workforce. The report also discusses P.L. 114-38, the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, which authorized and made permanent theSBA's recent practice of waiving the one-time, up-front loan guarantee fee for veterans (and their spouse) under the Veterans Express program.
The federal child nutrition programs provide assistance to schools and other institutions in the form of cash, commodity food, and administrative support (such as technical assistance and administrative funding) based on the provision of meals and snacks to children. In general, these programs were created (and amended over time) to both improve children's nutrition and provide support to the agriculture economy. Today, the programs refer primarily to the following meal, snack, and milk reimbursement programs (these and other acronyms are listed in Appendix A): the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), the School Breakfast Program (SBP), the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), the Special Milk Program (SMP), the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), and the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC or "Summer EBT"). The programs provide financial support and/or foods to the institutions that prepare meals or snacks served outside of the home (unlike other food assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Program) where benefits are used to purchase food for home consumption). Though exact eligibility rules and pricing vary by program, in general the amount of federal reimbursement is greater for meals served to qualifying low-income individuals or at qualifying institutions, although most programs provide some subsidy for all food served. Participating children receive subsidized meals andSnacks, which may be free or at reduced price. This report describes how each program operates under current law, focusing on eligibility rules, participation, and funding. This introductory section describes some of the background and principles that generally apply to all of the programs; subsequent sections go into further detail on the workings of each. Unless stated otherwise, participation and funding data come from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service's (USDA-FNS's) "Keydata Reports." The programs are most often dated back to the 1946 enactment of the National Schools Lunch Act, which created the National school lunch program, albeit in a different form than it operates today. The programs were most recently reauthorized in 2010 through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296). Some of the authorities created or extended in that law expired on September 30, 2015. The 114th Congress began but did not complete a 2016 child nutrition reauthorization (see CRS Report R44373, Tracking the Next Child Nutrition Reauthorization: An Overview). There was no significant legislative activity with regard to reauthorizing the programs in the 115th Congress.
The international oil market has influenced U.S. domestic and foreign policy decisions for decades. The United States plays a significant role in the world oil market, not only as the top consumer of crude oil and petroleum products, but also as the largest producer. Supply, demand, the strength of currencies, and other factors link crude oil to the world market to determine the price. Because the United States is a top consumer and producer of oil, it has the ability to influence this world market. Trade agreements, regulation, sanctions, and unpredictable events all contribute to the flow of oil in the global market. Congress may consider policies that affect the worldoil market, including sanctions, alternative fuel standards, emission controls, use of electric vehicles, and protection of international trade routes. This report provides an introduction to the U. S. and world oil markets, with an overview of supply and demand, price considerations, and trade flows. The report also includes analysis on selected examples of international conditions that in the past have affected policy decisions in the United states. The potential impacts of the worldOil market on the climate and the environment are not within the scope of this report. However, the impact of the oil market on policy decisions may be of interest to Congress. Congress has enacted several laws intended to secure the nation's oil supply, including the creation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in 1975, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA; P.L. 94-163), and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards that began in model year (MY) 1978 for passenger cars and for light trucks in MY 1979. CAFE standards require auto manufacturers to meet miles-per-gallon fuel economy targets for passenger vehicles and light trucks sold in theUnited States. If a manufacturer fails to do so, it is subject to financial penalties. In August 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed amendments to CAFE Standards. These proposed amendments offer eight alternatives for MY 2021-2026. The agencies' preferred alternative is to retain the existing standards through MY 2020 and then to freeze the standards at this level for both programs through MY 2026. Congress also has passed several laws establishing tax credits for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires transportation fuel to contain an increasing amount of renewable fuels, including conventional biofuel and biomass-based diesel. The RFS, in concept, intends to provide some diversification to transportation fuels away from a strong reliance on traditional gasoline or diesel derived from crude oil. Implementing the RFS has been challenging due to a number of factors (e.g., infrastructure, technology, and limited federal assistance). Other major policy considerations could include international trade policies, infrastructure, diversification of transportation fuels, and funding in research and development. Congress could enact legislation to increase or reduce production by opening areas or restricting certain technologies. Furthermore, emissions controls and emissions-related policies could play a pivotal role in oil market decisions. For instance, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P. l. 115-123) expanded the 45Q tax credit from $10 to $35 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) for use in enhanced oil recovery, while at the same time expanding oil production.
This report provides an overview of the federal response to domestic violence—defined broadly to include acts of physical and nonphysical violence against spouses and other intimate partners—through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) of 1984 (P.L. 98-457) and the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA, P. l. 103-322). FVPSa was the first federal law to address domestic violence, with a focus on providing shelter and services for survivors; however, since the enactment of VAWA in 1994, the federal government's response has expanded to involve multiple departments and activities that include investigating and prosecuting crimes, providing additional services to victims and abusers, and educating the criminal justice system and other stakeholders about violence against women. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) administers most of the funding for FV PSA programs, including grants to states, territories, and Indian tribes to support local organizations that provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of domestic violence and their children. ACF also provides funding for a national domestic violence hotline that responds to calls, texts, and web-based chats from individuals seeking assistance. The CDC funds efforts to prevent domestic violence through a program known as Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancement and Leadership Through Alliances (DELTA). The House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) Committee have exercised jurisdiction over FVpsA. The House and Senate committees have held hearings on domestic violence issues, and the House has passed several bills to reauthorize and expand the act, including H.R. 3590 (H.Rept. 111-320), which extended funding authority through FY2015. In addition, the Senate Committee on Finance has held hearings and passed H.Res. 9 (S.Revelations of the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA), which reauthorized the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) and expanded the scope of the act's purpose to include domestic violence prevention. The federal government responds to child abuse and elder abuse through a variety of separate programs. Federal law authorizes and funds a range of activities to prevent and respond to child and youth abuse and neglect under Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act and CAPTA. Separately, the Older Americans Act (OAA), the major federal vehicle for the delivery of social and nutrition services for older persons, has authorized projects to address elder abuse. The research literature has identified two underlying influences: the unequal position of women and the normalization of violence, both in society and some relationships. The evidence base for domestic violence does not point strongly to any one reason that it is perpetrated, in part because of the difficulty in measuring social conditions (e.g., status of women, gender norms, and socioeconomic status, among others) that can influence this violence. Still, the research literature does show that violence involving intimate partners is not uncommon, and that both women and men are victimized sexually, physically, and psychologically. Women tend to first be victimized at a younger age than men. Further, minority women andMen tend to be victimized in higher rates than their white counterparts. In the United States, over one-third (36%) of women reported that they experienced sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetimes. Women were more likely than men to experience certain types of intimate partner violence, including contact sexual violence (18% vs. 8%), stalking (10%) and severe physical violence (21%. Women were also much more likely to report an impact related to partner violence over theirlifetimes (25% vs 11%). Women and men of color tended to experience domestic violence at higher lifetime rates.
Unemployment Compensation (UC) is a joint federal-state program financed by federal payroll taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll Taxes under State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). These revenues are deposited into the appropriate account within the federal Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). Originally, the intent of the UC program, among other goals, was to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions. This intent is reflected in the current UC program's funding and benefit structure. When the economy grows, UC program revenue rises through increased tax revenues. At the same time, program spending falls because fewer workers are unemployed. The effect of collecting more taxes while decreasing spending on benefits dampens demand in the economy. It also creates a surplus of funds, or a reserve fund, for the program to draw upon during a recession. During an economic slowdown or recession, UC tax revenue falls and UC program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive UC benefits. The increased amount of UC payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of lost earnings by injecting additional funds into the economy and dampening job creation and consumer demand. States levy their own payroll taxes on employers to fund regular UC benefits and the state share (50%) of the Extended Benefit (EB) program. Federal unemployment taxes pay for the federal share of EB and for administrative grants to the states. Additionally, through the federal loan account in the UTF, FUTA funds may be loaned to insolvent states to assist the payment of the states' UC obligations. If the state does not repay the loan by November 10 of the second year, the state is subject to a reduction in the amount of state unemployment tax credit applied against the federal unemployment tax beginning with the preceding January 1 until the state repays the loan fully. Depending on the duration of the loan and certain other measures, one or more of three different credit reductions may be required. The credit reduction is initially a 0.3 percentage point reduction for the year starting with the calendar year in which the second consecutive January 1 passes during which the loan is outstanding; it increases by a percentage point for each year there is an outstanding loan. If any January 1 passed without an outstanding balance, the year count starts over with the next January 1. If a state has a credit reduction, the credit reduction may be avoided if the state meets certain other requirements. For example, a state must have sufficient amounts in the state account of the UTF to pay all compensation for the last quarter of that calendar year without receiving a loan. The state also must have altered its state law to increase the net solvency of its account with the UTF. In addition to these requirements, the phase-in of two new requirements began in 2014, and the full effect of the requirements will begin in 2019.
On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration submitted its FY2019 budget request to Congress. The budget request was released before final FY2018 appropriations were enacted and shortly after enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of FY2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123), which, among other things, increased the statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2018 and FY2019. The President's FY2019 request proposed $41.4 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which is the amount of new budget authority available for HUD programs and activities, not accounting for savings from offsets and other sources. That amount is about $11.3 billion (21.5%) less than was provided in FY2018. Most of that reduction ($7.7 billion) is attributable to program eliminations proposed by the President, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME, Public Housing Capital Funding, Choice Neighborhoods grants, and the programs funded in the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) account. The House Appropriations Committee approved its version of a FY2019 THUD appropriations bill (H.R. 6072) on May 23, 2018. The bill included $53.2 billion in total gross funding for HUD, or $43.8 billion after accounting for offsets and rescissions. This is about 29% more in gross funding than the President requested and slightly more (1%) than the amount provided in the House-passed version of the THUD bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved a THUD FY2019 appropriations bill on June 7, 2018 (S. 3023). Like the House committee bill, the Senate bill did not include the President's proposed eliminations, and instead proposed funding those programs at their prior-year levels. On August 1, 2018 the Senate approved its THUD-related appropriations bill, which was amended to include four regular appropriations acts, including Division D of the Financial Services Appropriations bill. Several HUD-related amendments were approved during floor consideration, none of which changed funding levels. A continuing resolution (CR) was enacted as part of a consolidated full-year Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education spending bill on September 28, 2018; however, no further action was completed before the expiration of the CR on December 21, 2018 and a funding lapse affecting the unfunded portions of the federal government, including HUD, commenced on December 22,2018. Following the start of the 116th Congress and during the funding lapse, the House passed several full- year THUD funding bills, but none of these were taken up in the Senate. On January 24, 2019, a second CR was enacted, providing funding through January 25, 2019. A third continuing resolution was enacted on January 25 that provided funding through February 15,2019, for THUD and the six other funding bills that had not received full year funding, allowing HUD and the other agencies that had been subject to the lapse to resume full operations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 was enacted providing full year FY2019 funding for the remaining agencies. The Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019 was included as Division G and its text mirrored that of the House bill. It provided funding for FY2019 for all of these agencies and included additional funding for border security, as well as full year appropriations for those agencies affected by the FY2018 funding lapse. The THUD provisions in Division G were identical to those that had passed the Senate in the 115th Congress in a separate omnibus funding bill, H.r. 6147, which had been passed by the Senate on January 23, 2017. The final FY2019 enacted funding level was $22.598 billion, an amount between the House Committee on Appropriations bill and Senate bill levels.
The federal government, through the Department of Energy, operates four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs), created by statute: the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration and the Western Area Power Administration. Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area of the coterminous United States (see Figure 1). Congressional interest in the PMAs has included diverse issues such as rate setting, cost and compliance associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205; 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq. ), and questions of privatization of these federal agencies. In addition to issues specific to individual PMA, some recent proposals have applied to multiple PMAs. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to sell the transmission assets owned and operated by the federal Power Marketing Administrations. The proposal suggested that "eliminating or reducing" the federal government's role in owning and operating transmission assets and increasing the private sector role would "encourage a more efficient allocation of economic resources and mitigate unnecessary risk to taxpayers." The proposal calls for federal transmission infrastructure assets (lines, towers, substations, and/or rights of way) to be sold, with the private-sector and/ or state and local entities potentially taking over the transmission functions now provided by the PMA. The Federal entities that would result after such sales could contract with other utilities to provide transmission service for the delivery of Federal power just as the S southeastern Power Administration already does. According to the Administration's FY2019 budget justification, the sale of federal transmission assets would result in a net budgetary savings of $9.5 billion, in total, over a 10-year window. However, the Administration dropped the plan due to stakeholder opposition. Proposals to sell all or part of the PMas are not new, and have been made in some form by almost every President since Reagan. Congress has sought to prevent executive branch alterations of PMA structures and authority. Under Section 208 of the Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1986, the executive branch is prohibited from spending funds to study or draft proposals to transfer from federal control any portion of the assets of thePMAs unless specifically authorized by Congress. The Trump Administration divestment proposal could have had an indirect impact on the original congressional intent for the PMs to provide electricity at the lowest possible cost. This report provides a brief overview of the four PMA and current issues facing these agencies. It will be updated as events warrant.
In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Egypt, and other GCC states, joined by a few other Muslim countries, severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, expelled Qatar's diplomats, recalled their ambassadors, and imposed limits on the entry and transit of Qatari nationals and vessels in their territories, waters, and airspace. They also accused Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and Iran. On June 22, 2017, the Saudi-led group presented Qatar with 13 demands, including closing Al Jazeera, severing relations with the Muslim Brotherhood, scaling back relations with Iran, closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, and paying reparations for its actions. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani has said that his country would not "surrender" its sovereignty. The United States and Qatar signed a formal defense cooperation agreement (DCA) on June 23, 1992. The DCA was renewed for 10 years, reportedly with some modifications, in December 2013. The text of the pact is classified, but it reportedly addresses U.S. military access to Qatari military facilities, prepositioning of U. S. armor and other military equipment, and training of Qatar's military forces. Qatar's force of about 12,000 is the smallest in the region except for Bahrain. Of that force, about 8,500 are ground forces, 1,800 are naval forces, and 1, 500 are air forces. A 2014 law mandates four months (three months for students) of military training for males between the ages of 18 and 35, with a reserve commitment of 10 years (up to age 40). Qatar is seeking to expand its military both in size and capacity. Since 2002, Qatar has contributed over $8 billion to support the expansion and enhancement of the large Al Udeid air base southwest of Doha. The air field, which also hosts the forward headquarters for the United States Central Command (CENTCOM), has been steadily expanded and enhanced not only with Qatari funding but also about $450 million in U.N. military construction funding since 2003. In March 2018, the State Department approved the sale to Qatar of equipment, with an estimated value of about $200 million, to upgrade the Air Operation Center at Al U deid. The January 2018 Strategic Dialogue resulted in a number of announcements of expanded defense and security cooperation, including Qatari offers to fund capital expenditures that offer the possibility of an "enduring" U.s. military presence in Qatar and to discuss the possible of "permanent [U.S.] basing" there. Qatar is currently the second-largest U.L. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customer, with $25 billion in new FMS cases, and is "on track" to surpass $40 billion in the next five years with additional FMS purchases. The FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act required a briefing for Congress on the F-15 sale, including its effect on Israel's "Qualitative Military Edge" (QME). On June 14, 2017 and June 20, 2018, Congress approved a reported $21 billion sale of 36 of the aircraft, which predated (and therefore were not covered by) then-Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Bob Corker's June 26, 2017 announcement that he would not provide informal concurrence to arms sales to the GCC countries until the intra-GCC rift was resolved. That blanket hold was dropped on February 8, 2018. The Trump Administration has sought to settle the dispute, but no progress has been made. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to the Gulf states in January 2019 produced no evident movement, and the U.K. envoy who was assigned to work on this issue resigned in early January 2019. The dispute has thwarted U.C. efforts to assemble the a new "Middle East Strategic Alliance" to counter Iran and regional terrorist groups. This alliance – to consist of the United Kingdom, Kuwait, the Arab world's leading Sunni-led powers, and several other Sunni-dominated states – has been repeatedly postponed since early 2018 and is not scheduled. The MESA has also been hampered by the global criticism of Saudi de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman for his possible involvement in the October 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Kashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and Egypt's April 2019 decision to refrain from joining the Alliance. Qatar asserts that the blockading countries are seeking to change Qatar's leadership and might take military action
Insurance is often seen as a localized product and U.S. insurance regulation has addressed this through a state-centric regulatory system. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by Congress in 1945, gives primacy to the individual states, and every state has its own insurance regulator and state laws governing insurance. Although the risks of loss and the regulation may be local, the business of insurance, as with many financial services, has an increasingly substantial international component as companies look to grow and diversify. The international aspects of insurance have spurred the creation of a variety of entities and measures, both domestic and foreign, to facilitate the trade and regulation of insurance services. The 2007-2009 financial crisis sparked further international developments, with heads of state of the G-20 nations creating the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The postcrisis 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) altered the U. S. insurance regulatory system, particularly as it relates to international issues. With the states continuing as the primary insurance regulators, the Federal Reserve exercised holding company oversight over insurers who owned a bank subsidiary or who were designated for enhanced supervision (popularly known as systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs) by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The FSOC includes a presidentially appointed, independent voting member with insurance expertise as well as a state regulator as a nonvoting member. The Federal Reserve, already a major actor in efforts at the FSB and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, thus became a significant insurance supervisor and joined the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) more than 20 years ago to promote cooperation and exchange of information among insurance supervisors, including development of regulatory standards. The new federal involvement in insurance issues has created frictions both among the federal entities and between the states and federal entities, and has been a subject of both congressional hearings and proposed legislation. This report discusses trade in insurance services and summarizes the various international entities and agreements affecting the regulation of and trade in the insurance industry. It then addresses particular issues and controversies in greater depth, including the recently concluded United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and the United States' covered agreement with the European Union (EU) on insurance. It also addresses issues relating to international insurance standards, such as the International Insurance Standards Act of 2017 (H.R. 3762), which was not taken up by the Senate in the 115th Congress. The report also includes an Appendix addressing legislation addressing international insurance issues that was passed by the House and Senate during the 115 th Congress. In 2017, insurance services accounted for nearly $798 billion of U.s. exports and $542 billion of imports, creating a surplus of $255 billion. This surplus has dropped from its peak in 2009 but has been consistently in deficit for many years. Overall, the North American and European domestic insurance markets are highly competitive and there are fewer suppliers and less competition in the Asia-Pacific region. The United States and the EU signed the first bilateral insurance covered agreement on September 22, 2017. The covered agreement is a relatively new form of an international agreement, established along with the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) in Title V of the Dodd- Frank Act (P.L. 111-203) as a type of international insurance or reinsurance agreement for recognition of prudential measures that the FIO and the US Trade Representative (USTR) negotiate on a bilateral or multilateral basis. This agreement is currently in its statutory 90-day layover period (which began December 11, 2018) before it can take effect. Congress could enact legislation directly affecting the agreement, conduct hearings, or allow the covered agreement to take effect without direct action.
Under existing law, all significant U.S. nuclear cooperation with other countries requires a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement. Such agreements, which are "congressional-executive agreements" requiring congressional approval, do not guarantee that cooperation will take place or that nuclear material will be transferred, but rather set the terms of reference and authorize cooperation. Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended (P.L. 83-703) requires that any agreement for nuclear cooperation meet nine nonproliferation criteria and that the President submit any such agreement to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The President may exempt an agreement for cooperation from any of the requirements in Section 123 if he determines that the requirement would be "seriously prejudicial to the achievement of the United States' non Proliferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize the common defense and security." The President must also submit an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) to Congress and a classified annex to the NPAS, prepared in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to explain how the agreement meets the AEA requirements. The NPAS must also include a written determination that the performance of the proposed agreement will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, or not jeopardize, the common Defense and Security. Congress has the opportunity to review a proposed agreement for two time periods totaling 90 days of continuous session. In practice, the President has sent the agreement to Congress at the beginning of the full 90-day period, which begins on the date of transmittal. If the agreement is an exempted agreement, Congress must adopt a joint resolution of approval and it must become law by the end of the 60- day period or the agreement may not enter into force. The United States has argued that its December 2009 nuclear cooperation agreements with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) could set a useful precedent for mitigating the dangers of nuclear proliferation. For example, President Barack Obama argued that the agreement had "the potential to serve as a model for other countries in the region that wish to pursue responsible nuclear energy development." Similarly, then-State Department spokesperson P.J. Crowley described the agreement as "the gold standard" during an August 5, 2010, press briefing, although the Obama Administration generally did not use this term when describing its nuclear cooperation policies. In December 2013 after an interagency review, the Administration announced that renouncing domestic enrichment and reprocessing would not be a prerequisite to concluding a nuclear cooperate agreement for all countries, and each partner country would be considered individually. On December 19, 2018, Senators Markey and Rubio introduced S. 3785, the No Nuclear Weapons for Saudi Arabia Act of 2018, and Representatives Sherman and Messer introduced the companion bill, H.R. 7350. The bills would require a joint resolutions of approval for a 123 agreement with Saudi Arabia. In addition, the bills' text includes the sense of Congress that no 123 agreement should be approved until Saudi Arabia has "been truthful and transparent with regard to the death of Jamal Khashoggi" and prosecuted those responsible, "renounced uranium enrichment and plutonium enrichment on its territory," concluded an IAEA Additional Protocol, and made "substantial progress on the protection of human rights, including the release of political prisoners." The bills require the President to submit a report assessing progress along with a proposed 123 agreement. The text also includes a statement of policy that the UnitedStates should oppose sales of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia through the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) until the country has renounced enrichment.
Congressional interest in the federal government's small business management and technical assistance training programs has increased in recent years. One of the reasons for the heightened level of interest in these programs is that small business has led job formation and retention during previous economic recoveries. There is also a general consensus that making these programs more effective and responsive to the needs of small businesses would assist the national economic recovery. However, there are disagreements over how to achieve that goal. Some advocate (1) increasing funding for existing programs to enable them to provide additional training opportunities for small businesses while, at the same time, maintaining separate training programs for specific demographic groups as a means to ensure that those groups' specific needs are met; (2) requiring the SBA to make more extensive use of outcome-based performance measures to determine program effectiveness; and (3) temporarily reducing or eliminating federal matching requirements to enable SBA's training resource partners to focus greater attention to service delivery and less to fund raising. Others argue for a merger of existing programs that would reduce costs and improve program efficiency, focus available resources on augmenting the capacity of Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) to meet all small business groups' needs, and require the SBCs to make additional use of outcomes-based measures to assess program effectiveness. This report examines the historical development of federal small business training programs; describes their current structures, operations, and budgets; and assesses their administration and oversight, including measures used to determine their effectiveness. It also examines legislation to improve SBA program performance and oversight. The Small Business Administration (SBA) supports a number of management and training programs, including the following: SBDCs, Women's Business Centers (WBCs), SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives), Microloan Technical Assistance Program, PRIME (Program for Investment in Micro-entrepreneurs), 7(j) Program, Native American Outreach Program, and several initiatives, such as the Entrepreneurial Development Initiative (Regional Innovation Clusters), Boots to Business (Boots to Business initiative), Entrepreneurship Education (Entrepreneurial Education initiative), Growth Accelerators (Growth Accelerators), and the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. The SBA also provides training to minority business owners to assist them in obtaining contracts and financial awards. In addition, the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration's Local Technical Assistance program promotes efforts to build and expand local organizational capacity in economically distressed areas. The Trump Administration requested $30.0 million to close the EDA in FY2018 and $14.9 million in FY2019. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) was established by Executive Order 11625, issued on October 13, 1971, and published in the Federal Register the next day. It clarified the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to implement federal policy in support of the minority business enterprise program, provide additional technical and management assistance to disadvantaged businesses, assist in demonstration projects, and coordinate the participation of all federal departments and agencies in an increased minority enterprise effort.
The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), most recently comprehensively amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (P.L. 114-95), is the primary source of federal aid to elementary and secondary education. Title I-A is the largest program in the ESEA, funded at $15.8 billion for FY2018. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) determines grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on four separate funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG), and Education Concentration Grant formulas. Under each formula, a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a "formula child count," consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children living in families in poverty, by an "expenditure factor" based on state average per pupil expenditures for public elementary andsecondary education. These maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula after taking into account a variety of state and LEA minimum grant provisions, such as state per pupil spending levels. The four formulas are combined and used jointly once funds reach LEAs. Under three of the four formulas—Basic, concentration, and targeted grants—funds are initially calculated at the LEA level. Under the fourth formula, EFIG, grants are first calculated for each state overall and then are subsequently suballocated to LEAs within the state using a different formula. This report provides estimated FY2018 state grant amounts under each of these four formulas for states. Overall, California received the largest total FY2018 Title II-A grant amount ($2.0 billion) and, as a result, the largest percentage share (12.76%) of all FY2018 grants. Wyoming received the smallest FY2018 total grant amount of $35.9 million and the smallest percentage share of grants (0.23%). In general, grant amounts for states vary among formulas due to the different allocation amounts for the formulas. For example, the Basic Grant formula receives a greater share of overall FY2018 appropriations than the Concentration grant formula, so states generally receive higher estimated grant amount under the Basic grant formula than under the concentration grant formula. Within a state, the percentage shares of funds allocated may vary by formula, as certain formulas are more favorable to certain types of states (e.g., EFIG is generally moreavorable to states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their LEAs). If a state's share of a given Title I–A formula exceeds its share of Overall Title I I-A funds, this is generally an indication that this particular formula is more favorable than formulas under which the states share of funds is below its overall share of Title I–A funds. In states that are estimated to receive a minimum grant under all four formulas (North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming), the shares under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas are greater than under other formulas, due to higher state minimums.
Firearms regulation in the United States is an area of shared authority among federal, state, and local governments. Individual states have enacted a variety of laws relating to the possession, registration, and carrying of firearms, among other things. However, federal law establishes a baseline regulatory framework that state and local laws may not contradict. Thus, the current collection of federal firearms laws may be thought of as a regulatory floor that sets out, at the federal level, the minimum requirements for lawful manufacture, sale, and possession of firearms. Federal firearms regulation has been a subject of continuous interest for Congress. A range of proposals have been in this and past Congresses. Some seek to ease federal firearms restrictions or facilitate state reciprocity in the treatment of persons authorized to carry firearms by another state; others seek greater restrictions on the federal laws concerning firearms possession, transfer, or sale or the expansion of background checks for firearm purchases. This report provides an overview of the federal firearms regulatory framework, including a brief discussion of the major constitutional constraints that may limit Congress's ability to regulate firearms. The report also provides a brief overview of selected legal issues for the 116th Congress that may be relevant in the context of firearms regulation. For example, the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that "[a] well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." In District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that the second Amendment guarantees an individual right to possess firearms for historically lawful purposes. During the upcoming October 2019 term, the Court is scheduled to review a Second Amendment challenge to a New York City firearm licensing provision in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York. That ruling may provide further guidance for Congress in crafting legislation that comports with the second amendment. Additionally, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that "n]o person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." The Constitution also grants Congress the power "to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." Congress has relied on the Commerce Clause as a constitutional basis for a number of Gun Control Act (GCA) provisions restricting the manufacture, importation, possession, and transfer of firearms and ammunition. The Supreme Court has reviewed a few of these regulations. Early cases mainly involved statutory interpretation, centering on what conduct the statutory prohibitions reached. Only the most recent case—United States v. Lopez—directly addressed the scope of Congress's Commerce Clause power to regulating firearms. In response, Congress amended the statute in 1996 to make clear that it applies only to firearms that have "moved in or otherwise affect interstate or foreign commerce." This amended version of the GCA has been upheld by lower courts, but has been challenged on constitutional grounds in federal district court. In recent years, Congress has also considered legislation to expand firearm background checks, including the Gun-Free School Zones Act, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA), and the Fix NICS Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-246). In addition, some Members of Congress have proposed measures that would require states to recognize concealed carry privileges afforded by other states, including both S. 69, the Constitutional Carry Reciprocity Act of 2019, and H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Recipient Act, which seeks to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court.
Over the past several years, federal law enforcement officials have repeatedly referred to heroin as a top drug threat in the United States. This is largely based on the health risks—overdose and death—posed by these substances. Heroin is one of several opioids that have contributed to the nation's ongoing opioid epidemic, which is estimated to be one of the highest in the world. The United States confronts the drug problem through a combination of efforts targeting both the supply of and demand for drugs. The federal government has a number of strategies and initiatives targeting illicit drugs. While they do not all focus on drug trafficking per se—or even more specifically, heroin trafficking—their goals include reducing drug trafficking. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is charged with coordinating federal drug control policy. In doing so, ONDCP is responsible for producing the annual National Drug control Strategy (strategy), the purpose of which is to outline a plan to reduce illicit drug consumption and the consequences of such use. The most recent strategy was released in 2016. The 2016 strategy prioritizes seven approaches to reduce both illicit drug use and its consequences: preventing drug use in U.S. communities; seeking early intervention opportunities in health care; increasing access to treatment and supporting recovery; reforming the criminal justice system to better address substance use disorders; disrupting domestic drug trafficking and production; bolstering international partnerships; and improving information systems for analysis, assessment, and management. While these approaches and principles are not necessarily directed at countering heroin trafficking, they focus on confronting the top drug threats, which have in recent years involved heroin trafficking and its role in the opioid epidemic. In addition, the National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy (NSBCS) was first launched in 2009, and it outlines domestic and transnational efforts to reduce the flow of illegal drugs, money, and contraband across the Southwest border. The Trump Administration has issued executive orders that could affect federal efforts to counter heroin trafficking. For instance, the executive order Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking, issued in February 2017, relies in part on the Threat Mitigation Working Group—which was established as part of the Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime—to, among other things, support and bolster U. S. efforts to combat criminal organizations. However, the order does not speak to the larger strategy or specific efforts to Counter heroin Trafficking. The executive order Establishing the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis was also issued in March 2017. The commission's final report recommended a variety of actions, including providing enhanced penalties for the trafficking of fentanyl and its analogues as well as bolstering tools and technologies to detect fentanyl before it enters the United states. The task force also recommended using coordinated, real time data sharing to disrupt drug supply and to focus prevention, treatment, and intervention resources on the areas that need them most.
The Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program—commonly known as the "8(a) Program"—provides participating small businesses with training and technical assistance designed to enhance their ability to compete effectively in the private marketplace. As a business development program, its overall goal is for 8( a) firms to graduate from the program and continue to do well in a competitive business environment. One of the program's major benefits is that 8(A) firms can receive federal contracting preferences in the form of set-aside and sole-source awards. A set- aside award is a contract in which only certain contractors may compete, whereas a sole- source award is an award without competition. In FY2017, 3,421 8(a] firms were awarded more than $27.1 billion in federal contracts, including $8.0 billion in set-Aside awards and $9.4 billion in sole- sources. Other programs provide similar assistance to other types of small businesses (e.g., women-owned, HUBZone, and service-disabled veteran-owned). The Small Business Administration (SBA) reviews and certifies eligible clients; assigns SBA personnel (Business Opportunity Specialists, BOSs) to monitor and measure each firm's progress through annual reviews, business planning collaboration, and systematic evaluations; helps to identify potential contract opportunities; and markets each firms' technical capabilities to federal agency procurement officials. The SBA's Office of Business Development (BD), housed within the Office of Government Contracts and Business Development, oversees the program. In addition, the SBA administers the 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance Program, the 8(i) Mentor-Protégé Program, and provides various various program statistics. This report provides a brief overview of the 8 (a) program, including its historical development, key requirements, administrative structures and operations, and SBA oversight. It also discusses two SBA programs designed to support 8(e) firms, the 7 (j) and 8(g) Management Management Assistance Programs, and discusses various current program issues. It concludes with an analysis of the following current issues: (1) SBA decision to address recent declines in the number of program participants by revising and streamlining the program application process, an action which SBA Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports "may erode core safeguards that prevented questionable firms from entering the program." (2) Reported variation in the service delivery of 8(b) firms through the interpretation and implementation of standardized policies and procedures, including the use of common BOS practices that vary from SBA district office to district office and across state lines; (3) disagreements over the financial thresholds used to determine economic disadvantage; and (4) the adequacy of the performance measures used to evaluate program success.
This report provides historical documents and other resources related to past government shutdowns, along with brief annotations that describe the contents of the documents. The report includes links to full-text documents when available. There is limited information and guidance related to shutdowns and it is difficult to predict what might happen in the event of one, but information about past events may help inform future deliberations. The following annotated resources are meant to guide readers to relevant materials from governmental and selected nongovernmental sources. This report will be updated as events warrant. The December 2018-January 2019 partial government shutdown began on December 22, 2018, and ended on January 25, 2019. At the beginning of FY2019 (October 1, 2018), five of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted in consolidated appropriations bills and the other seven appropriations bills were funded under two continuing resolutions (CRs). The first CR, P.L. 115-245, provided funding for the remaining seven bills through December 7, 2018. The second CR, which extended funding through December 21, 2018 for these seven bills, expired at midnight at the end of the day on December 21. When no agreement was reached on legislation to further extend the period of these CRs, a funding gap began with the expiration of the funding in the third CR at midnight on January 19. The funding gap ended when a fourth CR was signed into law on January 22, 2019, which ended the funding gap and allowed government departments and agencies to reopen. The partial shutdown lasted 35 days, making it the longest shutdown in history, compared with other shutdowns that have occurred since key Department of Justice opinions were issued in 1980 and 1981. During the time period of the shutdown, President Donald J. Trump made a number of statements related to the government shutdown, including a video teleconference with members of the military, an address to the nation, and remarks by President Trump on the crisis at the border. President Trump also spoke at a press briefing at the Rio Grande Valley U.S.-Mexico Border on January 11, 2019 and at a meeting with Customs and Border Patrol employees on January 14, 2019 to discuss border security. The Senate passed a resolution (S.Rept. 113-10) on January 16, 2019 that would have extended funding for most government operations through February 15, 2019; however, no further action was taken on this measure. The House passed its version of H.R. 2586, which would have provided temporary funding for federal agencies and programs through March 15,2019, but the Senate did not act on it before the deadline on March 15. The 113th Congress also held hearings on the effects of a shutdown on the federal government and on the economy during the October 2013 shutdown. For more information, see CRS Report R43250, CRS Resources on the FY2014 Funding Gap, Shutdown, and Status of Appropriations, by Justin Murray.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 was enacted to "assist in preserving, developing, and assuring accessibility to ... outdoor recreation resources." Two main goals of the law were to facilitate participation in recreation and "to strengthen the health and vitality" of U.S. citizens. To accomplish these goals, the law included "providing funds" for federal land acquisition and for federal assistance to states generally related to outdoor recreation. The fund is authorized to receive $900 million in revenues annually under the LWCF Act. The majority of these revenues come from oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) of the Gulf of Mexico and from the federal motorboat fuel tax and surplus property sales. However, revenues that accrue under the act are available only if appropriated by Congress through the discretionary appropriations process. The LWCF also receives additional revenues from OCS leasing under the Gulfof Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA) that are mandatory appropriations and can be used only for grants to states for outdoor recreation purposes. The overall level of annual appropriations (discretionary and mandatory combined) has varied widely since the fund's origin in FY1965. For each year since FY1965, appropriations for land acquisition have been provided to some or all of the major federal land management agencies—the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), and Forest Service (FS). In addition, for nearly every year since 1965, appropriations have funded the outdoor recreation matching grant program, to assist states in recreational planning, acquiring recreational lands and waters, and developing outdoor recreational facilities. Beginning in FY1998, appropriations from the fund have been used each year, except FY1999, to fund other federal programs with related natural resource purposes. These other purposes have included facility maintenance, ecosystem restoration, historic preservation, payments in Lieu of taxes, and other activities. From FY1998 to FY2019, the total amount appropriated for other purposes has totaled $2.7 billion, or 27% of the $10.0 billion total appropriation for the fund. FWS and FS have received the largest shares of the appropriations for other purpose, about $1.4 billion (53%) and $1 billion (38%), respectively. BLM, NPS, the U. S. Geological Survey, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs have shared the remaining $0.2 billion (9%) of the total appropriations for these purposes. Since FY2008, funds have been appropriated annually only for two programs: Forest Legacy and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. These two programs and a third grant program funded prior to FY2008 from LWCF—FWS State and Tribal Wildlife Grants—have received more than three-quarters ($2.1 billion, 79%) of all appropriations for the program since FY1998. The remainder has been used for other activities, such as land acquisition, conservation planning, and research and education.
The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), an independent federal agency, administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance act (RUIA). These acts cover workers who are employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries, railroad associations, and railroad labor organizations. Lifelong railroad workers receive railroad retirement benefits instead of Social Security benefits; railroad workers with nonrailroad experience receive benefits either from railroad retirement or Social Security, depending on the length of their railroad service. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, although the rate of decline has been irregular and recent years have seen increases in railroad employment after reaching an all-time low of 215,000 workers in January 2010. Recently, railroad employment peaked in April 2015 to 253,000 Workers. The total number of beneficiaries under the RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 beneficiaries in FY2017, and total benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same time. The average monthly benefit for each beneficiary was about $1,986 in 2017, reflecting the growth in average wages and prices. The RRA program is mainly financed by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT), all of which accounted for 93.9% of gross RRA funding during FY2017. The remaining 6.1% of the program was financed by federal income taxes levied on railroad retirement benefit payments, interest on investment and other revenue, and general appropriations to pay the costs of phasing out vested dual benefits. Payroll taxes, which provided 47.0% of total RRA gross funding in FY 2017, are the largest funding source for railroad retirement, survivors, and disability benefits. Railroad retirement payroll taxes are divided into two tiers—Tier I and Tier II taxes. The Tier I tax is the same as the Social Security payroll tax: railroad employers and employees each pay 6.2% on earnings up to $132,900 in 2019. Tier II tax revenues are used to finance Tier II benefits, the portion of Tier I benefits in excess of social security retirement benefits (such as unreduced early retirement benefits for railroad employees with at least 30 years of railroad service), and supplemental annuities. In addition to these two types of benefits, railroad workers may also be eligible for other benefits, such as disability and sickness benefits, which are paid in addition to any paid leave or private insurance an employee may have. The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-90) established the NRRIT to manage and invest surplus railroad retirement assets in the same way that the assets of private-sector and most state and local government pension plans are invested. The combined fair market value of Tier II and N RRIT taxes and assets is designed to maintain four to six years' worth of RRB benefits and administrative expenses. To maintain this balance, the Railroad retirement tax rates automatically adjust as needed.
A range of federal incentives supports the development and deployment of alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation. These incentives include tax deductions and credits for vehicle purchases and the installation of refueling systems, federal grants for conversion of older vehicles to newer technologies, mandates for the use of biofuels, and incentives for manufacturers to produce alternative fuel vehicles. Some of these incentives have expired in recent years when their authorizations expired. Others, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5), have been in place for several years. This report provides a brief overview of the federal incentives and programs that support alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies. In general, they are independently administered by separate federal agencies, including five agencies: Department of the Treasury, Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This report does not address more general programs (e.g., general manufacturing loans, rural development loans), or programs that have been authorized but never funded. In addition to concerns over petroleum import dependence, other factors also have driven policy on alternative fuels. Federal incentives do not reflect a single, comprehensive strategy but rather an aggregative approach to a range of discrete public policy issues, including improving environmental quality, expanding domestic manufacturing, and promoting agriculture and rural development. The federal tax incentives discussed in this report aim to support the development of alternative fuels, but there is no central coordination of how these incentives interact. For more information, see CRS Report RL33498, Federal Tax Incentives for Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10130, Energy Independence and Security: A Brief Overview of Federal Tax Exempts and Policy Responses to Fuel Consumption and Vehicle Emissions, both by [ author name scrubbing]. This report will be updated as warranted by legislative events or other events.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was created in 1949 to provide a framework for coordinating U.S., Canadian, and West European defense against the threat from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. NATO's foundational mutual defense clause—enshrined in Article 5 of NATO's founding NATO Treaty—sought to prevent both further Soviet expansion and the United States' ability to fracture the alliance. An additional objective was to bind the formerly warring European states (including France, the UK, Italy, and, crucially, West Germany) in a security arrangement that could prevent the outbreak of future hostilities among them. As NATO's first Secretary General, Lord Ismay reportedly quipped, NATO was created "to keep theSoviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down." Throughout the Cold War, U. s. leaders assessed that the strategic benefits of defending Western Europe from an expansionist Soviet Union, building interoperable European militaries, and preventing renewed hostilities among Western European states outweighed the cost of maintaining a vast U. S. military presence in Europe that included more than 400,000 troops as well as nuclear weapons. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent reunification of Germany, some in NATO questioned whether or in what form NATO should continue to exist. The United States and other allied leaders determined that the alliance could still play an important role in fulfilling shared security objectives beyond Cold War territorial defense. The allies agreed to a new nonconfrontational posture based on a drawdown of military forces and a focus on spreading peace, stability, and democracy throughout Europe. The wars in the Western Balkans in the 1990s spurred debate within NATO about so-called "out of area" operations. The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on theUnited States were another pivotal moment in NATO's evolution. For the first and only time, the allies invoked NATO's Article 5 mutualdefense clause and offered military assistance to the United states in responding to the attacks. Over the next 13 years, Canada and the European allies would join the United Nations to lead military operations in Afghanistan in what became by far the longest and most expansive operation in NATO history. As of March 2019, almost one-third of the fatalities suffered by coalition forces in Afghanistan have been from NATO members and partner countries other than the United United States. In 2011, the high point of the NATO mission in Afghanistan, about 40,000 of the 130,000 NATO troops deployed to the mission were from non-U.S. NATO countries and partners. Since 2014, NATO has taken major steps to strengthen its territorial defense capabilities and deter Russia. NATO has established an Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) of about 4,500 troops in the three Baltic States and Poland, increased military exercises and training activities in Central and Eastern Europe, and created new NATO command structures in six Eastern European countries. As part of broader efforts to confront terrorist threats posed by instability in the Middle East and North Africa, the alliance has launched a training mission in Iraq. NATO continues to maintain a security force of 3,800 troops in Kosovo and also is seeking to develop more robust cyber defense capabilities to more effectively confront hybrid warfare. Since NATO's creation in 1949, the UnitedStates has been viewed as the unquestioned leader of the alliance, but it also has faced criticism from some Members of Congress and analysts that its leadership has fostered an imbalanced and unsustainable "burdensharing" "burden" on European allies. President Donald Trump has amplified these concerns, and his assertions that NATO is a "bad deal" have caused some analysts and policymakers to reassess the costs and benefits of its long-standing leadership of NATO. Although successive U.s. presidents have called on the allies to increase defense spending, none has done so as stridently as President Trump. He is also the first president to publicly suggest that the United State could modify its commitment to NATO should the allies fail to meet agreed defense spending targets. Trump Administration officials stress that the Administration remains committed to NATO, as articulated in the Administration's National Security and Defense Strategies, and they highlight the successful efforts in 2017 and 2018 to substantially increase funding for the U.N.-led European Deterrence Initiative (EDI, previously known as the European Reassurance Initiative, or ERI). Nevertheless, many supporters of NATO, including some allied governments, continue to question the President's commitment to the alliance and worry that his condemnations could damage NATO cohesion
The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill provides funding for the federal government's financial regulatory agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Small Business Administration (SBA). It also funds the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies, commonly referred to as TTHUD, and four independent agencies: the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), FTC, SEC, and SBA. On February 12, 2018, President Trump submitted his FY2019 budget request to Congress. The request included a total of $49.1 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $282 million for the CFTC. This total included a proposed legislative provision on government-wide transfer authority in Section 737, which was estimated at $3 billion by the appropriations committees. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a FSGG Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 6258, H.Rept. 115-792) on June 15, 2018. The bill included $45.7 billion in total funding for FSGG agencies and $255 million for CFTC, with the largest differences in funding for GSA and the Executive Office of the President. The Senate began floor consideration of the bill on June 28, 2018 and passed it on August 1, 2018 (S. 3107). The Senate did not act on any other FY2019 appropriations bills prior to the beginning of the 115th Congress, which began on December 22, 2017. No additional appropriations were passed in the 115 th Congress, leading to a funding lapse for the agencies as well as those funded in six other appropriations bills beginning onDecember 22,2018. On January 3, 2019, the House of Representatives passed two consolidated appropriations bills—H.J.Res. 10, which passed the House on June 8, 2017 and S. 488, as amended by the House, on July 17, 2018—that included FSGG funding. On July 19, 2018 the House passed the Interior appropriations bill for FY2019, which included $46.0 billion in FSGG funds, including a $3.2 billion difference from the President's FY2019 request for the GSA, and the Senate passed its version of S. 3108, which funded FSGG and other agencies at $44.9 billion, with a difference of $2.8 billion. On September 13, 2018 a conference committee on the House-passed version of the Interior bill, S. 6147, convened, but no conference report was reported before the end of the fiscal year. The conference committee did not report a conference report, however, and no further action was taken on the conference report. Instead, Division C of P.L. 116-9, which contained seven appropriations bills, was signed into law on February 15, 2019. This act provides full FY2019 funding for government operations that had not been previously funded, including FSGG provisions nearly identical to those in the House bills, but located in Division D. The primary substantive differences were in the Department ofthe Treasury Forfeiture Fund and in the amount of GSA funding. This report will not be updated.

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), administered by the Department of Energy (DOE), has been a part of U.S. oil security policy for over 40 years. Originally intended as a reserve to replace oil that might be withdrawn from the world market to forward political purposes and objectives, its rationale has evolved with the changing world oil market and the role of the United States in the market. In addition to replacing oil lost to political turmoil, as in Libya in 2011, in recent years it has been more commonly used to replacement oil supplies curtailed due to natural disasters, mainly hurricanes. The effects of hurricanes, especially those of the magnitude of Katrina, Rita, and others, have threatened to disrupt oil production, refining, and distribution, creating potential economic dislocation. Use of oil from the SPR has helped to minimize the economic effect of those events. Since 2010, the oil market in the United states has been transformed. Low growth in petroleum product demand, rapidly increasing domestic oil production and falling net imports of crude oil and petroleum products have reduced U. S. dependence on foreign oil suppliers. At the same time, export sources on the world oil markets have expanded, reducing the ability of any one exporter, or group of exporters, to manipulate the market and thus reducing the need for a government-owned oil reserve. As a result, some have questioned whether the SPR should be either downsized to reflect current supply and demand balances, or even eliminated entirely. Since 2015, Congress has passed legislation which mandates the sale of SPR oil to fund a variety of government activities. For some, a question exists as to how much oil might be removed from the Reserve while still maintaining an adequate oil "safety net." Others question whether the evolving world market requires the UnitedStates to maintain any government- owned reserve holdings. This report addresses the questions of mandated sales and "right sizing" the SPR, as well as strategies to make optimal use of the reduced need for oil storage capacity. It will be updated as events warrant.

This report provides an overview of the FY2019 budget request and appropriations for the International Trade Administration (ITA), the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). These three trade-related agencies are funded through the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations. This report also provides a review of these trade agencies' programs. When comparing the Administration's FY2019 request with FY2018 funding, one may want to consider that the Administration formulated its FY2018 budget request before full-year appropriations for FY2018 were enacted. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), enacted on March 23, 2018, provided $482.0 million in direct funding for ITA, $93.7 million for USTIC, and a total of $72.6 million in funding for USTR. The FY2018 appropriation for the three CJS trade- related agencies totaled $648.3 million. For FY2019, the Administration requested $590.8 million for these three agencies, an 8.9% decrease from the FY2018-enacted amount. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported their CJS appropriation bills in the spring of 2018, and both committees largely declined the budget cuts requested by the Administration for these agencies. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3072 on June 14, 2018; the Senate bill included $655.5 million for the agencies, which was $64.8 billion (11.0%) more than the Administration request and $7.3 billion (1.1%) less than the amount enacted in FY2018. Through February 15, 2019, the CJS agencies operated under continuing resolutions (CRs)—with the exception of a three-week lapse in funding when agencies halted most operations. Congress passed final FY2019 appropriations in the Consolidated appropriations act, 2019 (P,L. 116-6), which was signed into law on February15, 2019. The act included $647.0 billion in direct appropriations for these trade-based agencies—a 0.2% decrease in funding from FY2018 appropriations. For the three trade agencies, the act provided $484.0million in total direct appropriations (0.4% increase from FY2017 appropriations), $95 million in total appropriations for USITC, and $68.2 million in overall funding for the USTR for FY2019. The President submitted his FY 2019 budget request to Congress on February 12, 2018. In it, the President proposed a total funding level for the trade agencies that included $440.1 million (an 8.7% decrease) in direct funds for the ITA; $87. 6 million (a 6.5% decrease); and $63. 0 million (13.2%) for USR. The Administration's budget request included reduced funding for all three agencies. However, the request did not include a request for funding to be drawn from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund (TETF). The TETF is a trust fund established by Section 611 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.,L. 114-125) to provide additional funding for trade enforcement activities. For USTR, the budget request requested $15 million to be derived from the TETF for enforcement activities authorized in Section 612 of the Act; the amount was reduced by $3.4 million (-0.5%) from the enacted FY2018 amount of $15.0. For ITA's Office of China Compliance, the requested decrease was $1 million (-1.4%) and the requested increase was $2 million (-2.1%). The House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 5952 on May 17, 2018—the Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (ESPA, 2019). The House committee bill included a total budget of $664.6 billion in total funding (9.6% increase over FY2018); the Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S.3072 recommended $488.0 in total funds (10.0% increase); and the House committee-reported H.Rept. 113-291 recommended $480.0 (9% increase).
The 116th Congress, in both its legislative and oversight capacities, faces numerous trade policy issues related to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiations and the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). On May 18, 2017, the Trump Administration sent a 90-day notification to Congress of its intent to begin talks with Canada and Mexico to renegotiate and modernize NAFTA, as required by the 2015 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Talks officially began on August 16, 2017. After numerous rounds of negotiations, on August 31, 2018, after the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary U.S.-Mexico agreement, President Trump notified Congress of his intention to "enter into a trade agreement with Mexico – and with Canada if it is willing." On September 30,2018, the three countries announced that they had reached an agreement on a USMCA trade deal that would revise, modernize, and replace NAFTA upon ratification. President Trump stated during his election campaign that NAFTA has been a "disaster" and the "worst agreement ever negotiated" and that he would withdraw from the agreement if it was not renegotiated. On November 30, 2016, President Donald J. Trump, then President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the conclusion of the negotiations for a modernized NAFTA, which would now be called the USM CA. On December 1, 2018 (after Mexico's new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was inaugurated), President Trump announced that he intended to notify Canada and Canada of his intent to withdraw from NAFTA in six months. On January 29, 2019, the President submitted to Congress a 60-day notice of intent to sign an FTA with Mexico and Canada, pursuant to TPA, and on February 14, the House and Senate agreed to act on legislation to implement the agreement. On March 1, the Senate passed a similar measure, but it has not yet been taken up in the House. The United States, Canada, and Mexico would have to agree to the agreement before it could enter into force. Congress may consider a number of issues in its consideration of the proposed agreement, including the constitutional authority of Congress over international trade, its role in revising, approving, or withdrawing from NAFTA, and the extent to which the agreement makes progress in meeting TPA objectives. Congress also may consider the agreement's impact on U. S. industries, the U.s. economy, and broader U.N. trade relations. The proposed US MCA, if approved by Congress, would revise some key provisions such as auto rules of origin, which, some argue, roll back longstanding U.L. FTA provisions. On the other hand, it would establish new updated provisions in areas such as digital trade and intellectual property rights. A key question for Congress may be whether the agreement strikes the right balance overall. In addition, Congress may examine the economic effects of the agreement and the broader strategic implications of possible withdrawal from NAFTA absent action on the USCMA. The USMca would not be expected to have a measurable effect on the overall economic growth of the United states, jobs, wages, or overall economic output, and it is not expected to significantly affect the trade deficit, which has increased since NAFTA entered into force in 1994. However, some analysts believe that it may have a significant impact on the motor vehicle industry, which may experience more significant effects than other industries.
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim recently announced that he was stepping down in February 2019 to join Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity fund that invests in projects in advanced and developing countries. Kim's unexpected resignation raises questions for policymakers as they nominate and select a new president for the World Bank, a central component of the U.S.-led international economic order for the past eight decades. According to an informal agreement among their member countries, the United States' nominee is chosen as World Bank president and a European candidate (typically French or German) is appointed as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This custom has been subject to increasing criticism during the past two decades. The first line of criticism is directed at the current distribution of voting power, which critics contend does not account for the increasing integration of developing countries into the global economy. A second line of criticisms is aimed at the method of selecting World Bank and IMF leadership, which, critics argue, elevates nationality above merit and undermines the legitimacy and effectiveness of the institutions. In such a diverse global economy, any agreement that grants the leadership position based on nationality unnecessarily limits the pool of potential candidates that may be exceptionally competent in addressing the issues before the Bank. Following Kim's announcement of his resignation, the Bank's Executive Board met on January 9, 2019, and issued a formal statement on the selection process. The nomination period for the next president ends on March 14, after which the Executive Board is to decide on a shortlist of three candidates. On February 6, President Trump nominated David Malpass, Treasury's Under Secretary for International Affairs, to be the next World Bank President. The Bank's Articles of Agreements and Bylaws provide for the appointment of the President, but do not specify how individuals are selected, on what criteria, or by what process they are vetted. The Executive Board aims to select the new president before the spring meetings in April 2019. This report provides information on the 2019 World Bank selection process and discusses efforts to reform the process. It will be updated as events warrant. For more information, see CRS Report RL33498, The World Bank: Selected Leadership and Reform Efforts, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10130, International Monetary Funds: Reform Effort at the IMF and World Bank.

Finklea-Baptist and [author names scrubbed].
Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States "by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate." The method by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, referred to broadly as the confirmation process, serves several purposes. First, it allows the Senate to examine the qualifications of nominees and any potential conflicts of interest. Second, Senators can influence policy, either by rejecting nominees or by extracting promises from nominees before granting consent. Senate confirmation is required for several categories of government officials. Military appointments and promotions make up the majority of nominations, approximately 65,000 per two-year Congress, and most are confirmed routinely. Civilian nominations considered by the Senate also include federal judges and specified officers in executive departments, independent agencies, and regulatory boards and commissions. With tens of thousands of nominations each Congress, the Senate cannot possibly consider them all in detail. A regularized process facilitates quick action on thousands of government positions. Most nominations are referred to committees within the Senate by unanimous consent, but some are referred by a request from a Senator at any time. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees "unless otherwise ordered." A standing order provides that some nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless a Senator requests referral. Instead of being immediately referred, the nominations are instead listed in a special section of the Executive Calendar, a document distributed daily to congressional offices and available online. After the chair of the committee with jurisdiction over a nomination has notified the executive clerk that biographical and financial information on the nominee has been received, this is indicated in the Calendar. After 10 days, the nomination is moved from the "Privileged Nominations" section and placed on the "N nominations" section with the same status as a nomination that had been reported by a committee. At any time, any Senator can request that a nomination be referred, and it is then sent to the appropriate committee of jurisdiction. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. An executive department nomination can be expected to be referred either to the committee that handled the legislation concerning that department or to the committees that handled legislation creating the position. Judicial branch nominations, including judges and U.S. attorneys, are under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The number of nominations referred to various committees differs considerably. The Committee on Armed Services, which handles all military appointments, promotions, and military service nominations, receives the most. The two other committees with major confirmation responsibilities are the Committee on the Judiciary, with its jurisdiction over nominations in the judicial branch, andthe Committee on Foreign Relations, which considers ambassadorial and other diplomatic appointments. Most of the time, committees do not formally present reports on nominations on the Senate floor. Instead, committee staff prepare the appropriate paperwork on behalf of thecommittee chair and file it with the clerk. The executive clerk then arranges for the nomination to be printed in the Congressional Record and placed in the Executive calendar. If a report were presented on the floor, it would have to be done in executive session. The President customarily sends nomination messages to the Senate in writing, and nominations are numbered by the executive clerks and read on the chamber floor. Except for nominations to the Supreme Court, nominations cannot be voted on on the day they are received, and many are referred immediately to committees. Most Senate committees that consider nominations have written rules concerning the process. Although committee rules vary, most contain standards concerning information to be gathered from a nominee, such as a biographical resumé and some kind of financial statement listing assets and liabilities.
The Department of the Interior (DOI) is a federal executive department responsible for the conservation and use of roughly three-quarters of U.S. public lands. DOI defines its mission as to protect and manage the nation's natural resources and cultural heritage for the benefit of the American people; to provide scientific and scholarly information about those resources and natural hazards; and to exercise the country's trust responsibilities and special commitments to American Indians, Alaska Natives, and island territories. Over the course of the department's roughly 170-year history, DOI has evolved in response to the needs of the nation and at the behest of Congress and the President. Some of these changes have been relatively broad in nature, such as the creation of a new agency or regulatory body. Other shifts have been smaller in scope, suchAs modifications to interagency processes or reorganizations in how resources or responsibilities are distributed among offices or programs. DOI reorganization proposals put forth by the Trump Administration have renewed attention to the structural relationship between DOI's various bureaus and their regulatory responsibilities. In March 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling on agency leaders to, "if appropriate," submit a proposed reorganization plan for their agencies to the director of the Office of Management and Budget within 180 days. In September 2017, then-Secretary of the interior Ryan Zinke issued a reorganization proposal for DOI. In June 2018, the President issued a more expansive government-wide reorganization proposed, which included further recommendations and proposals affecting the structure of DOI. This report provides a primer to understanding the organizational framework under which DOI operates, while providing context for how ongoing and proposed reorganizations might affect these operations. It provides a timeline of congressional and executive actions that have shaped the structure and function of DOI since its establishment. It also offers a brief summary of DOI's history, mission, and current structure, as well as an overview of the primary functions of its multiple bureaux and offices as of December 2018. Employment figures and corresponding maps illustrate the varying regional office structures among DOI bureums, as they exist currently. In addition, the report includes an summary of the annual funding and appropriations process for the department. A list of CRS experts for the issue areas covered by DOI is at the end of the report. In general, this report contains the most recently available data and estimates for DOI and its buresaus as of the publication of this report. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides services to federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and their nearly 1.9 million members. These services include disaster relief, child welfare, road construction, and the operation and funding of law enforcement, tribal courts, and detention facilities within native villages and reservations. The bureau also is responsible for protecting and administering assets on tribal lands, including the management of 55 million surface acres and 57 million acres of subsurface mineral estates held in trust by the United States. The BIA was also previously responsible for providing elementary and secondary education and educational assistance to Indian children through BIA's Office of Indian Education Programs. In 2006, however, the Secretary of Interior separated the BIA education programs from the rest of BIA and placed them in a new Bureau of American Indian Education (BIE) under the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs. As of FY2018, the BIE education system served approximately 47,000 students through 169 elementary/secondary schools and 14 dormitories located in 23 states. For the purposes of this reports, BIE is not considered a technical bureau of DOI, but employment figures are included in BIA totals listed above and in the "DOI Employment Levels" section.
Oman is located along the Arabian Sea, on the southern approaches to the Strait of Hormuz, across from Iran. Except for a brief period of Persian rule, Omanis have remained independent since expelling the Portuguese in 1650. The Al Said monarchy began in 1744, extending Omani influence into Zanzibar and other parts of East Africa until 1861. Sultan Qaboos bin Sa'id Al Said, born in November 1940, is the eighth in the line of the monarchy; he became sultan in July 1970 when, with British support, he forced his father, Sultan Said bin Taymur Al said, to abdicate. The United States has had relations with Oman from the early days since American independence. The U.S. merchant ship Ramber made a port visit to Muscat in September 1790. Oman opened its embassy in Washington, DC, in 1973. Career diplomat Marc Sievers has been Ambassador to Oman since late 2015. Oman is a close ally of the United States and a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a group that includes the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and several other GCC states. Oman has a relatively small but growing oil and natural gas sector, and is trying to attract foreign investment by positioning itself as a trading hub. The key to that strategy is the $60 billion project to build up Al Duqm as a transportation, energy, and military hub. Omani leaders have expressed willingness to join a "Middle East Strategic Alliance" of the GCC states and Jordan and Egypt, envisioned as countering Iran. That coalition was to be formalized at a U.N. summit planned for spring 2018 but, because of the intra-GCC rift, has been repeatedly postponed. Oman also has a close relationship with Iran, which has been a source of tension in the region since the Islamic Republic's 1979 Islamic revolution. Oman and Iran have been engaged in a number of bilateral and multilateral efforts to counter Iran's influence in the Middle East, including cooperation against the Islamic State Organization and on the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. In the past, Oman has also been a key player in regional conflicts in which Iran or its proxies have been involved, such as in Libya, Yemen, and Bahrain. In recent years, however, Oman's relations with Iran have become more strained as the two countries have increasingly cooperated on issues of mutual concern, including the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and the Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting the Houthi forces in Yemen. The Omani leadership has sought to ensure that the country's ties with Iran do not harm relations with the United Kingdom, and it has taken a more active role as a mediator in the conflict in Yemen, where it has hosted talks between Houthi representatives and brokered the release of several captives there. In addition, Omani officials have sought to improve ties with tribes and residents just over the border with Yemen to ensure the conflict does not spill over into Oman. Oman's relationship with Israel has also grown in recent years. In September 1994, Oman renounced the secondary and tertiary Arab boycott of Israel. In December 1994, it became the first Gulf state to officially host a visit by an Israeli prime minister (Yitzhak Rabin), and it hosted then Prime Minister Shimon Peres in April 1996. In October 1995, Oman exchanged trade offices with Israel, but there was no move to establish diplomatic relations. The trade offices closed following the September 2000 Palestinian uprising. In an April 2008 meeting in Qatar, de-facto Foreign Minister Alawi informed his Israeli counterpart (visiting Doha for a conference) that the Israeli trade office in Oman would remain closed until agreement was reached on a Palestinian state. Oman offered to resume trade contacts with Israel if it halted settlement construction in the West Bank—a condition Israel has not met. Oman publicly supports the Palestinian Authority (PA) drive for full U.O. recognition. In February 2018, foreign minister Alawi visited the Al Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem, which required coordination with Israeli authorities. He also met Palestinian officials in Ramallah during that trip. On October 25, 2018, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Oman and met with Omani Prime Minister Sultan QABoos. The two leaders discussed possible ways forward on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and on indirect Israeli communication with Iran via Oman. On March 24, 2019,
The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program provides long-term, low-interest loans and other types of credit assistance for the construction of surface transportation projects. Since its enactment in 1998 as part of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21; P.L. 105-178) through FY2018, the TIFIA program has provided assistance of $32 billion to 74 projects with a total cost of about $117 billion (in FY2018 inflation-adjusted dollars). The program is administered by the Build America Bureau of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and was reauthorized most recently in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act (P.l. 114-94) from FY2016 through FY2020. Direct funding for the program to make loans is authorized at $300 million for each of FY2019 and FY2020, but state departments of transportation can also use federal-aid highway grant money, both formula and discretionary, to subsidize much larger loans. The primary goal of the program, historically, has been to enable large-scale surface transportation construction projects by providing low- interest, long- term financing to complement state, local, and private investment. The TIFI program has been one of the main ways in which the federal government has encouraged the development of public-private partnerships (P3s) and private financing in surface transportation often backed by new, but sometimes uncertain, revenue sources such as highway tolls, other typesof user charges, and incremental real estate taxes. Congress has used the program as a model for other initiatives, notably the Water Infrastructure Finance Act (WIFIA), administered by EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Trump Administration's $200 billion infrastructure plan, for example, proposed adding several billion dollars of budget authority to the TifIA program and expanding eligibility to ports and airports. The experience of TIFia over the past decade shows, however, that there are limits to financing projects in this way. These limits include the number of projects that can take advantage of assistance, the difficulties of developing revenue mechanisms to service loans, the typical need for grant funding to make up a portion of the capital, and the difficulty of attracting private investment to risky projects, particularly those for which demand is uncertain or hard to predict. In the 115th Congress, several bills have been introduced that would expand T IFIA assistance, including the National Infrastructure Development Bank Act of 2017 (H.R. 547, S. 1168), the Partnership to Build America Act of Trump's 2017 infrastructure plan (H,R. 1669), and the Building and Renewing Infrastructure for Development and Growth in Employment (BRIDGE) Act, which was introduced in the House of Representatives but not in the Senate.
The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress is the most recent effort of the House of Representatives to examine its internal procedures and operations through the use of a specialized committee, commission, or party conference or caucus group. It was established by H.Res. 6, the House rules package for the 116th Congress (2019-2020), on January 4, 2019. The stated purpose of the select committee is "to investigate, study, make findings, hold public hearings, and develop recommendations on modernizing Congress." The select committee's authorization ends on February 1, 2020, and any activities beyond that date would require additional authorization. Twelve Members have been appointed by the Speaker to the committee in accordance with the authorizing resolution. On March 12, 2019, the committee held its first meeting. Thirty-five Members testified before the committee to present their own reform ideas spanning a wide range of subjects—for instance, changes to the standing rules, family-friendly adjustments to the House schedule, additional resources to support the work of Congress, and ways to delegate more policymaking responsibilities to individual Members. The committee's next three hearings (held on March 27, May 1, and May 10) included testimony from Capitol Hill practitioners, former Members, scholars, and others on a number of proposals the committee might consider in making its own recommendations. Additional hearings and other meetings are likely to be convened throughout calendar year 2019, and information on current and upcoming activities of the committee can be found on its official website. In addition, on March 26, the Committee on House Administration reported a resolution to fund House standing and select committees during the 116 th Congress, which the House agreed to the following day. This resolution authorized $487,500 for expenditures of the selected committee during the course of its investigation. All but $37,500 of this amount has been reserved for use during the first session of the116th Congress. This report will be updated as events warrant.

U.S. relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia have become increasingly strained in recent years in light of Prime Minister Hun Sen's suppression of the political opposition and his growing embrace of the People's Republic of China (PRC). In 2017, the Cambodian government banned the largest opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), for "conspiring with the United States to overthrow the government" and expelled the Washington, DC-based National Democratic Institute (NDI), which was engaged in democracy programs in Cambodia, on the grounds that NDI was not registered with the government. In 2018, the government made its first arrest under a lèse-majesté law, passed by the National Assembly in February 2018, which makes insulting the monarch a crime. As a result, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) ran virtually unopposed in the July 2018 National Assembly election and won all 125 seats. The Trump Administration stated that the election "failed to represent the will of the Cambodiaian people" and represented "the most significant setback yet to the democratic system enshrined in Cambodia's constitution.…" Between 1975 and 1991, Cambodia endured the four-year reign of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (also known as the Khmer Rouge), during which an estimated 2 million Cambodians died; an invasion and occupation by Vietnam; and civil war. The Paris Peace Agreement, signed by Cambodia and 18 other nations pledging to support the country's sovereignty and reconstruction on October 23, 1991, ended the Cambodia-Vietnamese War and set out a framework for a liberal democracy with periodic and genuine elections. Since the United Nations administered the first postwar national elections in 1993, Cambodia has made fitful progress in its political and social development, including the conduct of elections, a vibrant civil society, and a relatively open mass media. Hun Sen, age 65, has been the nation's leader for over 30 years, including as Premier of the Vietnam-backed Republic of KampUChea between 1985 and 1993, and as Prime Minister after the U.N.-sponsored national elections. The United States has been Cambodia's largest foreign aid donor, providing an estimated $797 million in official development assistance (ODA) for Cambodia in 2016, not including assistance from China. U.S.-Cambodian relations expanded after 2007, when political and human rights conditions in the Kingdom improved and some restrictions on assistance were lifted. In recent years, some observers have questioned the effectiveness of this assistance in keeping Hun Sen in power. In addition, some analysts have questioned whether the Kingdom's reliance upon foreign assistance, while still significant, has declined during the past decade-and-a-half. In the 115th Congress, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), enacted on March 23, 2018, mandated funds for democracy programs and programs in Khmer language to counter the influence of the PRC in Cambodia. Some policy experts maintain that continued U. S. engagement is the most effective course for promoting democratization from within and countering PRC influence. Some contend that many Cambodians view the UnitedStates favorably, and that Washington should continue to promote U.s. interaction with democratic forces in the kingdom. Some policymakers have also argued that the Kingdom should consider sanctions to pressure Hun Sen into reversing his suppression of democracy. Other experts argue that restrictions on Cambodian exports may hurt Cambodian workers and encourage Cambodia to seek closer relations with China, while it is uncertain whether such economic sanctions would weaken Hun Sen politically.
Whistleblowing is "the act of reporting waste, fraud, abuse and corruption in a lawful manner to those who can correct the wrongdoing." Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblowers are those employees or contractors working in any of the 17 elements of the IC who reasonably believe there has been a violation of law, rule, or regulation; gross mismanagement; waste of resources; abuse of authority; or a substantial danger to public health and safety. The essential distinction between whistleblowers generally and those in the IC (or those who otherwise have security clearances) is the concern for protecting classified information that may be involved in an IC-related incident or complaint. The IC has recognized that whistleblowing can save taxpayers' dollars, help ensure an ethical and safe working environment, and enable timely responses for corrective action. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (P.L. 111-259) included provisions for protecting IC whistleblowers, though these were general and subject to different standards of implementation. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19, signed in 2012, provided the first specific protections in response to perceptions that IC whistleblowers remained vulnerable to reprisal actions for making a complaint. PPD-19 requires IC elements to certify to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) a process for IC employees to seek a review of personnel actions the employee believes are in reprisal for a lawful disclosure. The review process also must provide for the security of classified information involved in a disclosure. In addition, the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) provides for the protection of members of the Armed Forces assigned to the IC elements, as well as contractors, from reprisals that could affect their eligibility for access to classified information. In January 2018, Congress passed the National Security Act of 1947 (Section 110) to address perceived gaps in protections for IC contractors. Section 110 amended existing whistleblower protections to enable IC contractors to make lawful disclosures to the head of the contracting agency (or an employee designated by the head for such purpose), or to the appropriate inspector general of the contractor agency, and to the DNI, IGIC, and the congressional intelligence committees (or members of these committees). This report provides a brief overview of IC whistleblower protections for contractors, including a discussion of the legislative history of IC whistleblowers and an overview of current legislative efforts to address the perceived gaps. It will be updated as warranted by legislative developments. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33487, Whistle Blower protections for Intelligence Community Contractors, by [author name scrubbed].
Since the founding, the federal courts have played a critical role in adjudicating legal disputes, including ones involving executive action. Naturally, Congress and its Members have an interest in litigating in federal court, for example, to vindicate their institutional priorities, to argue that the Executive is violating their legislative prerogatives, or to advance their legislative policy interests. During the Obama Administration, for instance, legislative entities brought or joined litigation in federal courts for a host of reasons, such as to challenge the Executive's decision to allegedly expend money without a congressional appropriation, to defend the Defense of Marriage Act from constitutional challenge in lieu of the Executive, and to challenge executive action in Libya. Likewise, during the Trump Administration, legislators have become involved in lawsuits that challenge the President's alleged unconstitutional acceptance of emoluments, suits demanding the production of documents from the Administration, and, in an amicus capacity, challenges to legality of the so-called travel ban. Congressional interest in litigation may increase in salience under the current divided government, as illustrated by the House of Representatives' resolution to authorize the House to participate in ongoing litigation in Texas involving the Affordable Care Act and a recent lawsuit brought by several Members of Congress challenging thePresident's appointment of an acting Attorney General. However, whenever any party seeks to invoke the power of the federal Courts, it must first show that its dispute belongs there. The federal courts apply a number of doctrines, known as justiciability doctrines, to ensure that they do not step beyond their bounds and decide issues more properly reserved for the other branches. Foremost among these doctrines is the requirement that a party seeking judicial relief from a federal court demonstrate "standing," that is, that the party has a personal stake in the outcome of the dispute as to warrant the invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and the exercise of the court's remedial powers on its behalf. This report provides an overview of the standing doctrine as it applies to lawsuits involving legislators, committees, and houses of Congress. First, the report lays out the general rules of standing as they apply in every case in the federal Court of Appeals and the main purpose behind the doctrine. Next, it considers the relatively few Supreme Court cases to discuss legislator standing, explaining the general principles that courts have drawn from those cases. The report then analyzes how lower courts have interpreted the limited Supreme Court case law on the issue, beginning with cases involving individual legislators, and following with cases brought by entire institutions, suchAs committees or houses of a legislature. The reports then considers other issues relating to legislator participation in litigation, including intervention under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or participation purely as an "amicus curiae," or a "friend of the Court." The report concludes by identifying unresolved doctrinal questions and offering takeaways for prospective congressional litigants.
This report describes and analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2019. It compares the enacted FY2018 appropriations for DHS, the Donald J. Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request, and the appropriations measures developed and considered by Congress in response to it. It also identifies additional informational resources, reports, and products on DHS appropriations that provide context for the discussion, and it provides a list of Congressional Research Service (CRS) policy experts with whom clients may consult on specific topics. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, with particular attention paid to discretionary funding amounts. These reports do not provide in-depth analysis of specific issuesrelated to mandatory funding—such as retirement pay—nor do they systematically follow other legislation related to the authorizing or amending of DHS programs, activities, or fee revenues. The Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2018, as part of an overall budget that the Office of Management and Budget estimated to be $74.88 billion (including fees, trust funds, and other funding that is not annually appropriated or does not score against discretionary budget limits). The Administration's request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $48.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2017 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). On June 21, 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out S. 3109, the Departmentof Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept.115-283. The Senate committee-reported bill would have provided $49.33 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for DHS. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (2.3%) above FY2018. The House Appropriations Committee-reported version of the bill, H.R. 6776, included $51.44 billion in net discretionary funds for the components funded in this title. This would have been $2.87 billion (7.5%) more than formally requested and $3.12 billion (6.8%) over the FY2018 level, setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations. The total budgetary resources projected for components funded under this title were $53.82 billion, $1.75 billion (3.8% more than was provided in FY2018; setting aside supplemental appropriations, the total budget was $54.01 billion. On September 28, 2018 the House and Senate passed a consolidated appropriations bill that included a continuing resolution (Division C) to fund DHS through January 25, 2019. The continuing resolution was extended through December 21,2018, at which point it expired, and annual appropriations lapsed, resulting in a partial shutdown of DHS for 35 days. On February 14, the House took up H.J.Res. 31, which included eight annual appropriations bills. Division A, the departmental appropriations bill, was passed by the House by a vote of 300-128 and by the Senate that same day. The President signed the bill into law the next day. Discretionary appropriations provide roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of the annual funding for the department, depending on how one accounts for disaster relief spending and funding for overseas contingency operations. The remainder of the budget is a mix of fee revenues, trust fund and mandatory spending.
This report summarizes and analyzes selected forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress and compares them with prior law or policy. These provisions were enacted through two legislative vehicles: The Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act, enacted as Division O of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, commonly referred to as the FY2018 omnibus) and signed into law on March 23, 2018, and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 ( P.L., 115-334, Title VIII). Both laws included provisions that address forest management through three general perspectives: (1) management of forested federal land, (2) federal programs to support forest management on nonfederal lands, known as forest assistance programs, and (3) programs to promote or conduct forestry research (to benefit both federal and non-federal forests). This report focuses primarily on the provisions related to management of Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands. FS is responsible for managing the 193 million acres of the National Forest System (NFS), and BLM manages 246 million acres under its jurisdiction. Two laws: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). These laws, among others, authorize specific forest management activities and establish procedures relevant to the respective agency's decisionmaking processes for those activities. The 115 th Congress enacted provisions that affect how FS and BLM implement those activities and procedural requirements. The report summarizes the provisions in the following categories: project planning and implementation, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration, and miscellaneous. Within each of those categories, the report broadly discusses relevant issues, summarizes the changes made in the115 th Congress, and discusses potential issues for Congress related to that category. Some provisions or sections are covered in more depth than others, generally reflecting the complexity of the issue, nature of the enacted changes, or level of congressional interest. A separate section at the end of the report discusses overall issue for Congress. The Appendix contains side-by-side tables comparing all of the forest-related provisions in each law to prior law. Provisions in each bill that directly affect forest management are included, with few exceptions for purposes of clarity; provisions in law that do not affect forest Management are not included. This report will be updated as warranted by legislative activity. For additional information, see CRS Report R40798, Forest Management in the United States, by [author name scrubbed].
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers a number of agricultural conservation programs that assist private landowners with natural resource concerns. These include working land programs, land retirement and easement programs, watershed programs, technical assistance, and other programs. The two lead agricultural conservation agencies within USDA are the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which provides technical assistance and administers most conservation programs, and the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which administers the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Most conservation program funding is mandatory, obtained through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and authorized in omnibus farm bills (about $5.3 billion of CCC funds for conservation in FY2018). Other conservation programs—mostly technical assistance—are discretionary spending and are funded through annual appropriations. For the first time since FY2002, the FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs. However, the enacted 2018 farm bill (Agriculture Improvement Act, P.L. 115-334) reauthorized and amended funding for many of these programs. It did, however, include legislative changes that affect farm bill programs and watershed programs. Similarly, the appropriations act for FY2019 did not reduce mandatory conservation funding, but it did include a decrease from FY2018 levels for discretionary conservation programs and redirected funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. The FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations acts also include policy provisions that direct how the executive branch should carry out an appropriation. These policy provisions may have the force of law if they are included in the text of an appropriations act, but their effect is generally limited to the current fiscal year. In some cases, the farm bill further amended the conservation programs amended in the FY2019 appropriations act. Where relevant, these amendments are noted; however, the focus is on amendments made in appropriations acts. In FY2019, a 34-day funding gap lasted from December 22, 2018, through January 25, 2019. It affected agencies funded by 7 of the 12 appropriations bills, including Agriculture appropriations. In general, a shutdown results in the furlough of many personnel and curtailment of affected agency activities and services. Exceptions may allow certain activities to continue, such as for law enforcement, protection of human life or property, and activities funded by other means such as carryover funds or user fees. Agencies make their own determinations about activities and personnel that are "excepted" from f shutdown and publish their intentions in "contingency plans" that are supervised by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). USDA published contingency plans for each agency, including NRCS. USDA initially estimated that 61% of its employees were excepted from furloughed in the agencies that are funded by Agriculture appropriations (all of USDA except the Forest Service), which amounts to 37,860 staff being excepted out of 62,288. The number of excepted and f shutdown-related personnel varied by agency. As previously discussed, NRCC funds conservation programs through both mandatory and discretionary accounts. As such, it was initially able to claim as excepted all of its 9,342 staff using mandatory program funding authorized through the farm bills, and therefore not affected by the lapse in discretionary appropriations. As the shutdown continued, however in February 2019, N RCS announced its intention to furl cough some employees beginning on February 3, 2019, to conserve carryover balances and focus excepted staff on mandatory farm bill conservation program implementation. This plan was not implemented because the shutdown ended in January 2019.
This report provides a brief overview of House rules and precedents governing the use of appropriations in the 115th Congress. It focuses primarily on the Holman Rule, which states that a provision changing existing law may not be reported in a general appropriation bill, including a provision making the availability of funds contingent on the receipt or possession of information not required by existing law for the period of the appropriation, except germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill. The Holman rule is intended to apply only when an obvious reduction of funds in the bill is achieved by the provision in question, such as through the cessation of specific government activities, or through a specific reduction of total appropriations. In addition, the exception does not apply to limitations (on the grounds that such language is not legislative) or legislative language unaccompanied by a reduction in funds in a bill. Legislation that is too broad has also typically not been allowed under the exception. This report will be updated as warranted by legislative developments. For more information on the House rules governing appropriations, see CRS Report RL33476, The House Rules of the House of Representatives, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10101, The Senate Rules ofthe House of the United States, by (author name also scrubbed). For a more detailed discussion of House precedents and rules on appropriations in general, see the following CRS reports: CRS Reports R44405, The Constitutionality of the U.S. Government: An Abridged Overview of the Constitution and Selected Precedents on the Use of the Legislative Branch in the 110th, 111th, and 112th Congresses; CRS report R44406, Appropriations in the 113th Congress: A Brief Legal Overview; and CSPI Report R44408, The Legislative Branch: A Primer on the Role of the Senate Appropriations Committee in the 114th and 115thCongresses. For additional information on House rules, precedents, and practices regarding appropriations, please consult CRS Legal Sidebar WSLG112-327, The Congressional Record: House Rulemaking in the First Session of the First Congress of the 114 th Congress (2001-2002). This report is an abridged version of an earlier version of this report, which was originally published in 2003 and has been updated to reflect legislative developments in the first session of the 115 th Congress as well as a discussion of some of the procedural changes made by the House in the second session.
"Too big to fail" (TBTF) is the concept that a financial firm's disorderly failure would cause widespread disruptions in financial markets and result in devastating economic and societal outcomes that the government would feel compelled to prevent, perhaps by providing direct support to the firm. Such firms are a source of systemic risk—the potential for widespread disruption to the financial system, as occurred in 2008 when the securities firm Lehman Brothers failed. Although TBTF has been a perennial policy issue, it was highlighted by the near-collapse of several large financial firms in 2008. Some of the large firms were nonbank financial firms, but a few were depository institutions. To avert the imminent failures of Wachovia and Washington Mutual, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) arranged for them to be acquired by other banks without government financial assistance. Citigroup and Bank of America were offered additional preferred shares through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and government guarantees on selected assets they owned. Some firms were rescued on those grounds once the crisis struck, although the government had no explicit policy to rescue TBTF firms beforehand. In response to the crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203), a comprehensive financial regulatory reform, was enacted in 2010. Among its stated purposes are "to promote the financial stability of the United States…, [and] to end 'too big tofail,' to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts." The Dodd- Frank Act took a multifaceted approach to addressing the TBTF problem. This report focuses on one pillar of that approach—the Federal Reserve's (Fed's) enhanced (heightened) prudential regulation for large banks and nonbankfinancial firms designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). Banks that have been designated as Global-Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) by the FSOC or have more than $250 billion in assets automatically remain subject to all EPR requirements, as modified by the Fed. In addition, Basel III (a nonbinding international agreement that U.S. banking regulators implemented through rulemaking after the financial crisis) included several capital requirements that only apply to large banks. In 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer protection Act (referred to herein as P. l. 115-174) eliminated most EPR requirement for banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion. However, the Fed has proposed rules that would impose more stringent requirements on banks with between $100 and $250 million in assets. The Fed has also proposed rules to implement the Fed-run net stable funding ratio (NSFR) and liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that would apply to banks with over $100 million and more in assets, respectively. The proposed rules would also apply to foreign banks operating in the United states, although they would be subject to more stringent EPR than the Fed's rules for foreign banks in the past. Under the proposed rules, all foreign banks would be placed in the same EPR categories, based on their assets, with requirements for each category similar to those applied to U. S. banks. The proposal would also require foreign banks to submit resolution plans (or living wills) that explain how they can safely enter bankruptcy in the event of their failures. In the view of the banking regulators and the supporters of P.l.115-174, these changes better tailor EPR to match the risks that large banks pose. Opponents are concerned that the additional systemic and prudential risks these changes pose outweigh the benefits to society of reduced regulatory burden, believing that the benefits will mainly accrue to the affected banks. Although systemic risk mitigation is the main purpose of enhanced regulation, there are also other potential benefits that could be lost by reducing the number of banks subject to it. For example, enhanced regulation could reduce the likelihood that a bank's failure would result in taxpayer exposure to FDIC insurance losses or due to "bailouts." Comparing the magnitude of benefits to the costs EPR imposes involves additional difficulty. In general, enhanced prudential requirements impose costs on large banks, but the extent to which those costs are passed on to customers potentially depends on a variety of economic factors, such as the degree of market competition and the price sensitivity of customers. Furthermore, from an economic net benefit perspective, the cost of large banks is less
Congressional interest in the Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Microloan program has increased in recent years, primarily because microloans are viewed as a means to assist very small businesses, especially women- and minority-owned startups, obtain loans that enable them to create jobs. Job creation and preservation, always a congressional interest, has taken on increased importance given continuing concerns about job growth. The SBA's Microloans program was authorized in 1991 (P.L. 102-140, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992). The program became operational in 1992. Its stated purpose is to assist women, low-income, veteran and minority entrepreneurs and business owners and other individuals possessing the capability to operate successful business concerns; to assist small business concerns in those areas suffering from a lack of credit due to economic downturns; ... to make loans to eligible intermediaries to enable such intermediary to provide small-scale loans, particularly loans in amounts averaging not more than $10,000, to start-up, newly established, or growing small businesses concerns for working capital or the acquisition of materials, supplies, or equipment; [and] to make grants to eligible intermediary entities that, together with non-Federal matching funds, will enable such intermediary entities to provide intensive marketing, management, and technical assistance to microloan borrowers. The program was made permanent, subject to reauthorization, in 1997. In FY2018, the SBA approved 58 loans to intermediaries totaling $37.3 million. The average approved intermediary loan amount was $643,724. Microloaned intermediaries provided 5,459 loans to small businesses totaling $76.8 million in FY2018. As of the end of FY2017, the program had disbursed $562.5 million in loans. The number and amount ofMicroloan loans have generally increased since the program's inception in 1991. The Microlo loan program is open to all small business entrepreneurs, but targets new and early-stage businesses in "underserved markets, including borrowers with little to no credit history,low-income borrowers, and women and minorities entrepreneurs in both rural and urban areas who generally do not qualify for conventional loans or other, larger SBA guaranteed loans." The program's estimated borrower default rate is about 12%. Because the Loan Loss Reserve Fund is used to contribute toward the cost of borrower defaults, and is often sufficient to cover the entire cost of such defaults, it is estimated to have a loss rate for intermediary repayment of less than 3% annually. Critics of the program argue that it is duplicative of other available programs, expensive relative to alternative programs, and subject to administrative shortfalls. Critics argue that its direct lending program and its training assistance grant program are duplicative with other SBA programs. They also argue that the program is expensive, costing about $7,506 per small business assisted in FY2017 compared to $1,316 per smallbusiness assisted in the SSA's 7(a) loan guarantee program. In addition, they argue that program administration is inadequate and argue that there is inadequate documentation exists to show that the "no credit elsewhere" test had been properly administered; that, in some cases, inadequate supporting documentation existed to show how the microloaned funds were used by the borrower; and that in some instances, interest rates and fees were charged that exceeded the limits allowed under the program rules and regulations. In its 2017 audit of the MicroLoan program, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the agency still had "internal control weaknesses" that prevented it from conducting "adequate program oversight to measure program performance and ensure program integrity." Specifically, the OIG audited 14 intermediary lenders and 52microloan files and found documentation deficiencies, or differences between the information contained in the lender's loan file versus that in the program Electronic Reporting System (MPERS) in 44 of the 52 files. The identified internal control weaknesses were due to the agency not having an overall site visit plan, an adequate information system, available funding for system improvements, or clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Additionally, SBA management focused on output-based performance measures instead of outcome measures. During the 111th Congress, Congress enacted legislation to increase the aggregate loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of program participation from $5 million to $6 million and to relax the requirements that no more
The Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program provides monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members and to the family members of deceased workers. The OASDI program operates as a pay-as-you-go program in which revenues (collected from payroll taxes and taxation of benefits) are paid out as monthly benefits. These monthly benefits constitute a substantial portion of income for a large segment of recipients. For many years, the program's revenues exceeded its costs (i.e., benefit payments), resulting in annual surpluses. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 established a number of provisions, including increasing the full retirement age, adding new federal workers into the program, and taxing Social Security benefits, which had a positive effect on the OAS DI Trust Funds. From 1983 to 2017, program revenues exceeded program costs, resulting in an average of an annual surplus. However, during the 1983-2017 period, interest rates fell, and the trust funds experienced falling interest rates. As a result, in 2017, the funds are projected to be at peak value. For 2018, the trustees project that program costs will exceed program revenues. The assets previously invested in the trust Funds will be drawn down to augment annual program revenues and fulfill annual scheduled payments. The trustees also project that under current law costs will be higher than revenues for the entirety of their 75-year projection period. Under the projection, the OasDI program will be able to draw upon trust funds' assets to fulfill scheduled payments until 2034, the date at which the trustees projects assets will be depleted. The Trust Funds' current investment practices have been criticized by some for not providing the program with a higher rate of return than the average interest rate earned in the past. For example, in 2003, the effective interest earned by all of the special issues held in the Trust Funds was 6.0%. This relationship between the average rate and effective interest rate is a consequence of the funds' special issues being evenly spread over maturity periods ranging from 1 year to 15 years. In an environment of falling interest rate falling, this investment structure results in one-fifteenth of the trust fund's assets coming due each year and being invested at a lower interest rate than they did in earlier years when interest rates were much higher. Criticisms of the Trust Fund's investment practices stem from the long-term solvency issues facing the program. The program is facing a funding shortfall due largely to demographic factors, and restoring long-Term Solvency would require a payroll tax increase or reduction in benefits. Critics argue that if the trustfunds had earned a better return in past years, they would be in a better financial position today. In response, the Social Security Advisory Council on Social Security has recommended that the program invest a portion of its assets in equities to help alleviate pressure on the actuarial balance. In addition, the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT) has incorporated equity purchases in its management of some Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) assets since 2002. The NRRIT is an independent, nongovernmental entity that invests in non-U.S. government securities, such as private stocks and bonds, and is not subject to the same oversight as federal agencies. The Board of Trustees is composed of seven trustees who have expertise in financial management and pension plans. Three of the members are selected by labor unions and three by railroad management.
As congressional policymakers continue to debate telecommunications reform, a major discussion point revolves around what approach should be taken to ensure unfettered access to the internet. The move to place restrictions on the owners of the networks that compose and provide access, to ensure equal access and nondiscriminatory treatment, is referred to as "net neutrality." There is no single accepted definition of net neutrality. However, most agree that any such definition should include the general principles that owners of networks should not control how consumers lawfully use that network, and they should not be able to discriminate against content provider access to that network. A major focus in the debate is concern over whether the regulatory framework as delineated in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) 2015 Open Internet Order is the appropriate approach to ensure access for content, services, and applications providers, as well as consumers, or whether a less regulatory approach contained in the 2017 Order is more suitable. The issue of regulation of and access to broadband networks is currently being addressed in three venues at the FCC, where the commissioners on December 14, 2017, adopted (3-2) an Order that went into effect on June 11, 2018, that revokes the 2015 regulatory framework in favor of one that reverses the 2015 classification of broadband internet access services as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act, and shifts much of the oversight from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ); in the courts, where consolidated petitions for review of the Order are under consideration in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit; and a suit filed in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of California by the DOJ and various trade groups, challenging the legality of a California internet regulation law, is pending; in the 116th Congress, where debate over what the appropriate regulatory framework should be for broadband access continues. Whether Congress will take broader action to amend existing law to provide guidance and more stability to FCC authority over broadband access remains to be seen. In 2005 two major actions dramatically changed the regulatory landscape as it applied to broadband services, further fueling the net neutrality debate. In both cases these actions led to the classification of Broadband Internet Access Services as Title I information services, thereby subjecting them to a less rigorous regulatory framework than those services classified as telecommunications services. In 2010, the FCC adopted an order, known as the "Open Internet Order," to establish rules to govern the network management practices of broadband access providers. The order, which was passed by a 3-2 vote on December 21, 2010, intended to maintain network neutrality by establishing three rules covering transparency, no blocking, and no unreasonable discrimination. In January 2014, a federal appeals court issued its ruling on the challenge to the FCC's Open Internet order (Verizon Communications Inc. v. Federal communications Commission). The court upheld the disclosure requirements of the order, but struck down the specific antiblocking rules. The court was of the opinion that the Order's nondiscrimination rules, applied to fixed broadband providers, and antib locking rules, which applied to both fixed and wireless broadband provider, were an impermissible common carrier regulation of an information service and could not be applied. In response to the court remand, then FCC Chairman Wheeler issued a statement outlining the steps proposed "to ensure that the Internet remains a platform for innovation, economic growth, and free expression." Chairman Wheeler proposed that the FCC establish new rules under its Section 706 authority that enforce and enhance the transparency rule that was upheld by the court, fulfill the "no blocking" goal; fulfill the goals of the nondisc discrimination rule; leave open as an option the possible reclassification of internet access service as telecommunications service subject to Title II authority; hold public service service service providers to their commitment to honor the safeguards articulated in the Order; and seek opportunities to enhance competition in the internet access market. The FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on May 15, 2014, seeking public comment on "how best to protect and promote an open Internet." The NPRM sought comment on a broad range of issues to help establish a policy framework to help ensure the internet remains an open platform and retains the concepts adopted by the FCC in its 2010 Open Internetorder, of transparency and no blocking. In February 2015, FCC Commissioners voted to adopt new open internet rules and released these rules on March 12, 2015. The rules went into force on June 12
Social Security provides insured workers and eligible family members with a measure of protection against the loss of income due to the worker's retirement, disability, or death. The amount of the monthly benefit payable to workers and their family members is based on a worker's career-average earnings from jobs covered by Social Security (i.e., jobs in which the worker was subject to the Social Security payroll tax). The Social Security benefit formula is weighted to replace a greater share of career- average earnings for low-paid workers than for high- paid workers. This means that low-wage workers receive relatively high benefits in relation to their payroll tax contributions, although the dollar amount of their benefits is lower than that provided to high-wage earners. The windfall elimination provision (WEP) is a modified benefit formula designed to remove the unintended advantage, or "windfall," of the regular benefit formula for certain retired or disabled workers who spent less than full careers in covered employment and who are also entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from noncovered employment. The WEP is intended to place affected workers in approximately the same position they would have been in had all their earnings been covered by social security. It applies to benefits payable to retired and disabled workers and to their eligible dependents who meet the criteria above, but does not apply to survivors of deceased insured workers. Under the WEP, the 90% factor in the first bracket of the formula is reduced to as low as 40%. The effect is to lower the proportion of earnings in this bracket that are converted to benefits. This reduces the amount of benefits paid to workers by $463.00 per month ($1,017.00 minus $554.00) for a worker with an average annual earnings level (AIME) of $4,000 instead of $1,500. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33487, Social Security: The Windfall Elimination Provision, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10107, Social security benefit formula: Analysis of Changes Made to the Windfalls Elimination Provisions in the FY2019 Budget Proposals (H.R. 6962, S. 3433, and S. 710) in the 115th Congress. In the 116th Congress, two bills were introduced in the House and one in the Senate that would eliminate the windfall provision: H.R., 141 (Social Security Fairness Act of 2019), introduced by Representative Rodney Davis on January 3, 2019, and Senator Sherrod Brown on February 14, 2019. S. 521, introduced by Senator Brown and Representative Davis, would repeal the Windfall eliminations provision and the government pension offset (GPO), which reduces Social Security benefits to spouses and widow(er)s of insured workers if the spouse or widow(e) also receives a pension based on government employment not covered bySocial Security. In 2016, SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) projected that the enactment of this legislation would increase (improve) the long-range actuarial balance of the combined trust funds by 0.04% of taxable payroll. SSA estimated in 2016 that repealing both the WINP and the GPO would reduce the net long-term cost of the social security trust funds. In 2017, H. R. 1205 and S, 915, identical bills both titled the Social security fairness act of 2017, would have repealed both the WRP and GPO. Other bills related to the current WEP in the 114th Congress included H.J.Res. 98-21, the Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act of 2018, which would have provided for a new proportional formula for individuals who would become eligible for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits in 2025 or later, and H. J.Rept. 6933 and S., 3526, which proposed to replace the current WRP with a new formula and provide for a rebate payment starting in 2020.
Trade promotion authority (TPA), sometimes called "fast track," refers to the process Congress has made available to the President for limited periods to enable legislation to approve and implement certain international trade agreements to be considered under expedited legislative procedures. Certain trade agreements negotiated by the President, such as agreements that reduce barriers to trade in ways that require changes in U.S. law, must be approved and implemented by Congress through legislation. If the content of the implementing bill and the process of negotiating and concluding it meet certain requirements, TPA ensures time-limited congressional consideration and an up-or-down vote with no amendments. In order to be eligible for this expedited consideration, a trade agreement must be negotiated during the limited time period for which TPA is in effect, and must advance a series of U. S. trade negotiating objectives specified in the TPA statute. In addition, the negotiations must be conducted in conjunction with an extensive array of required notifications to and consultations with Congress and other public and private sector stakeholders. Finally, the President must submit to Congress a draft implementing bill, which must meet specific content requirements, and a range of supporting information. If, in any given case, Congress judges that these requirements have not been met, T PA provides mechanisms through which the implementing bills may be made ineligible for expedited congressional consideration. TPA can be used for legislation to implement trade agreements reached before July 1, 2021. Under TPA, it originally was effective until July 2018, but it could be extended through July 2021 provided the President asked for an extension—as he did on March 20, 2018—and Congress did not enact an extension disapproval resolution within 60 days of July 2018. The legislative history of the current TPA was the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (H.R. 1890; S. 995), which was introduced on April 16, 2015. Similar, though not identical, bills were ordered to be reported by the Senate Finance Committee on April 22, 2015, and by the House Ways and Means Committee the next day. The legislation was joined with legislation extending Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) into a substitute amendment to an unrelated revenue measure, and that legislation was passed in the Senate on May 22 by a vote of 62-37. In the House of Representatives, the measure was voted on under a procedure known as "division of the question," which requires separate votes on each component, but approval of both to pass. Voting on June 12, the House passed TPA (Title I) by 219-211, but TAA (Title II) by 126-302. A motion to reconsider that vote was entered by then-Speaker Boehner shortly after that vote, and on June 18 the House again voted on TPA in an amendment identical to the Senate version. This amendment did not include TAA. This legislation passed the House on June 24 and was signed into law on June 29, 2015 (P.L. 114-26). The President has the authority to negotiate international agreements, including free trade agreements (FTAs), but the Constitution gives Congress sole authority over the regulation of foreign commerce and tariffs. For 150 years, Congress exercised this authority over foreign trade by setting tariff rates directly. This policy changed with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, in which Congress delegated temporary authority to the president to enter into (sign) reciprocal trade agreements that reduced tariffs within preapproved levels and implement them by proclamation without further congressional action. This authority was renewed a number of times until 1974, when Congress adopted fast track authority in the Trade Act of 1974. The act also established U.N. negotiating objectives and attempted to ensure executive branch notification of and consultation with the Congress and the private sector. Fast track was renamed Trade Promotion Authority in 2002 and was last extended in 2015. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2014 (S. 2854) was enacted in 2016, and TPA-2015 was passed by Congress in 2017. This report answers frequently asked questions related to TPA. It addresses the following questions: What is the current status of TPA? How many times has TPA/fast track been used? What are the negotiating objectives for trade agreements? How does TPA work? What is Congress's responsibility for trade under the Constitution? What authority does Congress grant the President by enacting TPA legislation? Is TPA necessary? Can Congress disapprove of the President's trade negotiations with a trading
In District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held in a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Scalia, that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides an individual right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, notably self-defense in the home. The Court's decision largely left unresolved much of the "who, what, where, when, and why" of Second Amendment protections. The Supreme Court did make clear, however, that it does not protect dangerous and unusual weapons. Since Heller, lower courts have been attempting to apply the Court's Heller decision in various Second Amendment challenges to federal, state, and local firearm laws. In particular, courts have examined what classes of persons, weapons, and places may be subject to Second Amendment protection, as well as the manner in which such categories may be permissibly regulated. This report provides a brief overview of the federal circuit courts of appeals' approach to evaluating Second Amendment challenged firearm regulations. It begins with a brief discussion of Heller, followed by a brief description of the circuit courts' post-Heller approach to reviewing firearms regulations. The report concludes with a discussion of Supreme Court cases that have examined the scope of the right to bear arms, including those challenges to state and local firearms laws. The first section of the report addresses the Supreme court's decision in Heller. Second, the report discusses the circuit court rulings that have addressed the question of what categories of persons and weapons may be protected by the second Amendment. Third, the section discusses the federal Circuit Court of Appeals' and Supreme Court's decisions in McDonald v. City of Chicago and New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. State of New York, respectively, which addressed the issue of whether the Second and Fourteenth Amendments' Due Process Clauses apply to the states. Fourth, the sections addresses the federal courts' interpretations of what constitutes "core" Second Amendment activity, as defined in Heller, and what level of scrutiny should be applied in evaluating such activity. Finally, the last section discusses how the federal government may regulate firearms in the event of a Supreme Court vacancy. This section concludes with an analysis of how the Supreme Supreme Court applied the Second amendment to the challenged D.C. firearm regulations, as newly interpreted, and concluded that the District's firearm regulations—which amounted to a near-total ban on handguns in the District—were unconstitutional. In reviewing these regulations, the courts have generally applied a two-step approach to evaluate Second Amendment claims. First, courts ask whether the challenged law targets conduct protected by Second Amendment rights. If so, the inquiry ends, as the law does not implicate the SecondAmendment. If it does, courts next ask whether, under some type of means-end scrutiny, the law is constitutional under that standard of review. In deciding which level of review to apply, courts generally ask whether a challenged law burdens core Second Amendment conduct, like the ability to use a firearm for self- defense in the house. If a law substantially burdens coreSecond Amendment activities, courts typically will apply strict scrutiny. Otherwise, courts will apply intermediate scrutiny. In addition, sometimes circuit courts have taken a different approach by asking whether a firearm regulation is "presumptively lawful" as envisioned by Heller. Further, some courts have deemed rational-basis review as "off the table" based on the majority's comments in Heller that rational basis review is "off-the-table." All told, most firearm laws have been reviewed under intermediate scrutiny, where the courts require a reasonable fit between the challenged laws and a substantial or important governmental interest asserted as the basis for the law. The cases show that the success of a law under this inquiry will depend on the evidence that the government puts forth. The courts will not take mere assertions by the government but require meaningful evidence, like legislative findings, empirical evidence, and academic studies. Based on the courts' survival survival, future legislation to regulate firearms may face a greater chance of survival in the courts if that legislation evidences a clear fit between its interest and the regulation.
Social Security is a self-financing program that provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members and to the family members of deceased workers. As of March 2019, there were approximately 63.3 million Social Security beneficiaries. Of those, 47.2 million (74.6%) were retired workers and family members, 10.1 million (16.0%) were disabled workers, and 6.0 million (9.4%) were survivors of deceased Social Security workers. Social Security is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by covered workers and by their employers. Employers and employees each pay 6.2% of covered earnings, up to an annual limit; self-employed individuals pay 12.4% of net self-employment income. The annual limit on taxable earnings is $132,900 in 2019. In addition to payroll taxes, the Social Security program has two other sources of income. First, certain beneficiaries must include a portion of Social Security benefits in taxable income for the federal income tax, and the social security program receives part of those federal tax revenues. Second, the program receives interest from the U.S. Treasury on its investments in federal government securities held by the trust funds. The Social Security trust funds are the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and the Federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Funds. In 2018, the combined OASI and DI trust funds had total receipts of $1,003 billion, total expenditures of $ 1,000 billion, and accumulated holdings (assets) of more than $2.9 trillion. The trustees project that Social Security expenditures will exceed tax revenues each year through the end of the 75-year valuation period (2093). That is, Social Security will operate with annual cash-flow deficits. When Social Security operates with a cash- flow deficit, the trust fund balance will begin to decline, until the asset reserves are depleted in 2035. The trust fund ratio, which represents trust fund assets at the beginning of a year as a percentage of cost for the year, is projected to be 273% in 2019 (2.73 times greater than the cost of the program in 2019). The Trustees project that this ratio will decline to 130% in 2028 and reach zero at the point of trust fund reserve depletion in 2034. The program would continue to operate with incoming Social Security receipts; those receipts would be sufficient to pay 80% of benefits scheduled under current law for 2035, declining to 75% of scheduled benefits in 2093. Social security is an issue of ongoing interest to lawmakers. For some advocates of reform, the focus is on restoring long-range solvency to the trust Funds and constraining the projected growth in spending for entitlement programs—including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid—in the context of broader efforts to reduce growing federal budget deficits. For others, reform is seen as an opportunity to address concerns about the adequacy of benefits and, more broadly, retirement income security. This report will be updated as warranted.
Article I, Section 6, of the U.S. Constitution, states that the compensation of Members of Congress shall be "ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States." Additionally, the Twenty-Seventh Amendment to the Constitution states, "No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened." This amendment was submitted to the states on September 25, 1789, along with 11 other proposed amendments, 10 of which were ratified and became the Bill of Rights. It was not ratified until May 7, 1992. Since FY1983, Member salaries have been funded in a permanent appropriations account. The most recent annual pay adjustment was in January 2009. Since then, most Senators, Representatives, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico have been paid $174,000. The only exceptions include the Speaker of the House ($223,500) and the President pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate ($193,400). The President's budget, submitted on February 13, 2012, proposed an average (i.e., base and locality) 0.5% adjustment for General Schedule (GS) employees. The President later stated in a letter to congressional leadership that the current federal pay freeze should extend until FY2013 budget negotiations are finalized. Section 114 of H.J.Res. 117, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, was passed by the House on September 13 and the Senate on September 22, 2012 (P.L. 112-175). It was signed by the President on September 28, 2012. The freeze was subsequently extended through the duration of this continuing resolution. The maximum potential January 2013 Member pay adjustment of 1.1%, or $1,900, was known when the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data for the change in the Employment Cost Index (ECI) during the 12-month period from December 2010 to December 2011 on January 31, 2013. The adjustment takes effect automatically unless it is either denied statutorily by Congress, or limited by the GS base pay adjustment, since the percentage increase in Member pay is limited by law to the base pay percentage increase. The FY2015 legislative branch appropriations bill (H.R. 4487) contained a provision prohibiting this adjustment. This provision was subsequently included in Section 8 of Division Q of the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, which was enacted on December 16, 2014. On August 29, 2014, President Obama issued an "alternative pay plan for federal civilian employees," which called for an across-the-board 1.0% increase in base salaries for GS employees. Legislation was introduced in the 112th Congress to repeal the automatic pay adjustment provision (for example, S. 133 and S. 148); change the procedure by which pay for members is adjusted or disbursed by linking it to congressional actions or economic indicators, including passage of a budget resolution, passage of appropriations, or reaching the debt limit; and prohibit pay for Members during a lapse in appropriations resulting in a government shutdown. The House-passed and Senate-reported versions of the legislative branch appropriation bill for FY2018 (H.-R. 3162 and S.-1648) both contained provisions to prevent this adjustment, but no separate votes were held on these provisions. The Member pay provision was included in the bills as introduced and no separate vote was held on this provision. Neither bill was enacted prior to the start of FY2018, and legislative branch activities were initially funded through a series of continuing appropriations resolutions (CRs) (P-L. 115-56, through December 8, 2017; P.L.-115-90, through January 19, 2018; P-L-115-96, through February 8, 2018, and P.-L- 115-123, through March 23, 2018). The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.-L. 114-141) prohibited the adjustment for the remainder of the year. This report provides historical tables on the rate of pay for Member of Congress since 1789; details on enacted legislation with language prohibiting the automatic annual payadjustment since the most recent adjustment; the adjustments projected by the Ethics Reform Act as compared with actual adjustments in Members' pay; and Member pay in constant and current dollars since 1992. Additional CRS products also address pay and benefits for members of Congress.
A deficit describes one of the three possible outcomes for the federal budget. The federal government incurs a deficit (also known as a net deficit) when its total outgoing payments (outlays) exceed the total money it collects (revenues). Deficits are measured over the course of a defined period of time—in the case of the federal government, a fiscal year. A balanced budget describes the case where federal receipts equal federal expenditures. The size of a deficit or surplus is equal to the difference between the levels of spending and receipts. Federal budget outcomes incorporate both "on-budget" activities, which represent the majority of federal taxes and spending, and "off-budget," which include revenues and outlays from Social Security trust funds and the Postal Service. For federal credit programs, the subsidy cost of government activities is included in deficit and surplus calculations. Federal debt is the money that the government owes to its creditors, which include private citizens, institutions, foreign governments, and other parts of the government. Debt may be taken at any time and represents the accumulation of all previous government borrowing activity. Debt increases when there are net budget deficits, outflows made for federal Credit programs, and increases in intragovernmental borrowing. In the long run, when economic output is affected by supply-side choices, the effect of government borrowing on economic growth depends on how amounts borrowed are used relative to what would have otherwise been done with those savings (i.e., an increase in private investment or net exports) if such borrowing had not taken place. Federal deficits and debt outcomes are interdependent; budget deficits increase federal debt levels, which in turn increase future net deficits because of the need to service higher interest payments on the nation's debt. This report provides a primer on the relationship between federal debt and the economy, including a discussion of how debt and deficits are integrated into the larger economy in both the short and long run. It also provides some ways to measure such interactions. The report will be updated periodically to reflect changes in economic conditions and to reflect legislative and regulatory developments.

The majority of Latin American and Caribbean countries are functional democracies, but institutional weaknesses and widespread public corruption in many of these countries have undermined effective governance and sparked protest and demands for greater transparency. From a U.S. perspective, widespread corruption in Latin America is a potential threat to regional security, has a symbiotic relationship with violent crime, and can be a stimulus for migration. The number of grand-scale scandals exposed in recent years in the region, such as payoff schemes involving high court justices and top-level officials, has led some voters to conclude that all parties and politicians are corrupt, resulting in presidents and vice presidents being pushed from office and traditional political parties being viewed as corrupt and illegitimate. Some analysts maintain that chronic corruption diminishes support for democracy and stokes cynicism about the integrity of politics. In the past, such demonstrations have proven ephemeral, quickly fading as the systemic nature of the problem has left citizens resigned to the status quo. However, 2018 saw prominent anti-corruption candidates and campaigns win elections across the region with populist and anti-establishment fervor marking campaigns in Mexico, Brazil, and several other countries. In these contests, leading candidates abandoned traditional parties sullied by corruption allegations. Grand corruption involving top political leaders has touched every nearly every part of Latin America, generating a wave of anti- corruption activism. In 2018, candidates of the left and the right—as in Mexico and Brazil—embraced anti- establishment platforms that appealed to voter disillusionment with corrupt elites. In addition, civil society organizations are attempting to build on their preliminary successes by pushing for institutional reforms to enhance transparency and accountability throughout the public sector. Although the fight against corruption is a global effort, this report focuses more closely on the United States' interests in fighting corruption in the Latin America and Caribbean region, and how U. S. policy and assistance programs have developed to address that goal. The report examines how corruption contributes to wasting public monies, distorting electoral outcomes, and reinforcing criminal structures. Contemporaryanti-corruption efforts in Brazil, Mexico, and Central America are examined as case studies. The United States has sought to work closely with established authorities and civil society actors in these countries to combat impunity, increase transparency, and dislodge corruption. In Mexico, for example, the Administration has supported rule of law reforms to increase judicial independence, reduce impunity, and protect journalists in the context of a strong central government. In Central America, with its historically weak governments, the multilateral institutions and outside experts have worked alongside the justice systems in Guatemala and Honduras to expose corruption and criminal control. The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), backed by the U.N., has recommended legal reforms and worked alongside Guatemalan institutions to dismantle a series of corruption networks. In Honduras, the Organization of American States-backed Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity In Honduras (MACCIH) has worked with the Honduran government to strengthen the country's anticorruption legal framework. In Guatemala, CICIG has investigated hundreds of government officials suspected of corruption, helped identify over 60 criminal networks, and secured more than 300 convictions since its inception in 2007. In January 2019, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales announced that he would not renew the commission's mandate, but the Constitutional Court overruled his decision, and the United Nations, the European Union, an NGO, and human rights advocates criticized Morales's decision. In February 2019, the drug trafficking kingpin Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán who led Mexico's notorious Sinaloa cartel for decades, was convicted in New York on multiple counts of operating a continuing criminal enterprise. The charges included trafficking more than 440,000 pounds of cocaine into theUnited States, murder, acts of torture, kidnapping, and money laundering. In some of the trial's most incendiary testimony, government witnesses testified that former senior officials in the Mexican government took bribes from Guz mán; one witness alleged that former president Peña Nieto (2012-2016) received a $100 million bribe from GuZmán. The conclusion of the GuzMán trial may do little to diminish the role of corruption generated by drug trafficking, which is entrenched and secured by the enormous profits of the drug trade. U.s. efforts to train judicial personnel and judges, establish rule-of-law programming, and professionalize police and judicial officials have had limited sustainable impact, and have raised concerns that the desired independence may be compromised
Temporary Protected Status (TPS), codified by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), provides temporary relief from removal and work authorization to foreign nationals in the United States from countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances that prevent their safe return. TPS was established by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-649). The statute gives the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with other government agencies, the authority to designate a country for TPS under one or more of the following conditions: ongoing armed conflict in a foreign state that poses a serious threat to personal safety; ongoing civil war in the country; an environmental disaster; or extraordinary and temporary conditions in a country that prevent its nationals from safely returning. In addition to TPS, there is another form of blanket relief from Removal known as deferred enforced departure (DED), formerly known as extended voluntary departure (EVD). DED is a temporary, discretionary, administrative stay of removal granted to aliens from designated countries. Unlike TPS and DED, a DED designation emanates from the President's constitutional powers to conduct foreign relations and has no statutory basis. DED was first used in 1990 and has been used a total of five times since then. Liberia is the only country currently designated under DED. In March 2018, President Trump announced that he would terminate DED for Liberians, with an effective date of March 30, 2020. A lawsuit challenging the termination was filed in federal court on March 8, 2019. The termination is on hold as of the date of this report as the result of a court order. In November 2017, the Trump Administration announced that it would terminate TPS for Nicaragua and El Salvador and put on hold a decision about Honduras. On January 8, 2018, DHS announced the decision to terminate TPM for El Salvador—whose nationals account for about 60% of TPS recipients—after an 18-month transition period. El Salvador's TPS designation is scheduled to end on September 9, 2019, while Honduras's designation is set to expire on January 5, 2020, although the termination is currently on hold due to a court decision. The large number of Central Americans with TPS along with their length of U.S. residence and resulting substantial economic and family ties have led some to support extending TPMs for Central Americans and Salvadorans in particular. In January 2017, DHS extended and redesignated Yemen's current TPM designation through September 3, 2018. The redesignation updated the required arrival date for individuals from Yemen to January 4, 2017, and extended Yemen's designation for another 18 months, resulting in an expiration date in March 2020. In April 2018, Secretary Nielsen announced that the designation for Nepal was set to terminate on June 24, 2019; however, a 12-month delay of the termination date was announced in April 2018 to allow for an orderly transition. This report provides a brief overview of the TPS program and describes the historical use of the program. It also provides data on the countries currently designated for TPM, including the conditions that have contributed to their designation. The report concludes with a brief discussion of legislative activity in the 115th and 116th Congresses related to the program, including proposals to extend or expand TPS designations for certain countries (e.g., Venezuela), prohibit federal funds from being used to implement recent TPS terminations, or provide adjustment to legal permanent resident (LPR) status for foreign nationals who have been living in theUnited States for several years. It will be updated as warranted.
The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. On December 15, 2016, the Navy released a force-structure goal that calls for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships of certain types and numbers. The Navy's FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, H.R. 2810/P.L. 115-91 of December 12, 2017) made the Navy's 355-ship force-level goal U.S. policy in Section 1025 of the FY2018 NDAA. This provision states: "It shall be the policy of the United States to have available, as soon as practicable, not fewer than 355 battle force ships, comprised of the optimal mix of platforms, with funding subject to the availability of appropriations or other funds." The term "battle force ships" in the above provision refers to the ships that count toward the quoted size of the Navy in public policy discussions about the Navy. On April 30, 2018, the Administration withdrew its FY2020 Navy shipbuilding budget proposal to not fund a mid-life refueling overhaul for the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman, and to retire CVN-75 around FY2024. The Administration now supports funding the overhaul and keeping the carrier in service. As a result of the withdrawal of its proposal, the projected number of aircraft carriers and consequently the projected total number of all ships are now one ship higher for the period FY2022-FY2047 than what is shown in Table 4, and the line in Figure 2 would be adjusted upward by one ship for those years. (The figures in Figure 4 are left unchanged from what is showed in the FY 2020 budget submission so as to accurately reflect what is shows in that budget submission.) The Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of355 ships in FY2034, which is 20 years sooner than the Navy projected in its FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan. This is primarily due to a decision by the Navy to extend the service lives of some ships (i.e., cruisers and destroyers) to 45 years (a consequence of the decision to extend their service lives) and to increase the number of amphibious ships. Although the Navy projects it will have more than the required number of large surface combatants from FY2030 through FY2040, it will also have fewer than required aircraft carriers through the end of the 30- year period, fewer than needed attack submarines through FY 2047, and fewer than necessary amphibious and other ships through the ends of that period. The mix of ships will not match that called for by the FY2016 force structure assessment (FSA) but the Navy acknowledges that if the Navy is going to have too many ships of a certain kind, DDGs are not a bad type of ship to havetoo many of, because they are very capable multi-mission ships. One issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Administration's FY2020 shipbuilding program and, if so, how to assess the appropriateness of that program when a key measuring stick for conducting that assessment—the Navy's force- level goal and planned force mix—might soon change. Another oversight issue for the Navy concerns the prospective affordability of its 30-Year Shipbuilding Plan. This issue has been a matter of oversight focus for several years, and particularly since the enactment in 2011 of the Budget Control Act, or BCA (S. 365/P.-L. 112-25 of August 2, 2011). Observers have been particularly concerned about the plan's prospective affordability during the decade or so from the mid-2020s through theMid-2030s, when the plan calls for procuring Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines as well as procuring large numbers of replacements for retiring submarines, cruisers, and destroyer ships. This report will be updated as events warrant.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency of the federal government charged with performing and supporting biomedical and behavioral research. It has major roles in training biomedical researchers and disseminating health information. The NIH mission is "to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability." NIH is the largest and most visible contributor to the federal biomedical research effort; it represents about half of federal spending for non-Department of Defense research and development (R&D) and about one-fifth of total federal R&D funding. As of FY2018, NIH was the largest single public funder of biomedical research in the world. Congress maintains a high level of interest in NIH for a variety of reasons. NIH funds extramural researchers in every state, and widespread constituencies contact Congress about funding for particular diseases and levels of research support in general. NIH-funded research has led to major medical innovations such as treatments for heart disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. Such advances have been credited with helping increase life expectancy and prevent millions of deaths. However, in light of the high cost of new medical innovations, some question whether NIH priorities are too focused on research that leads to new treatments rather than on disease prevention or improving the value of medical care. The allocation of NIH research dollars is a major source of debate. NIH has seen periods of both low and high funding growth. From FY1998 to FY2003, Congress doubled the NIH budget over a five-year period, from $13.7 billion to $27.1 billion. The agency then saw low funding growth or cuts from FY2004 to FY2015. FromFY2016 through FY2019, Congress provided NIH with funding increases of over 5% each year, increasing funding from $30.3 billion in FY2015 to $39.3billion in FY2019. Under President Trump's budget request for FY2020, NIH would be provided a program level of $34.2 billion—a 12.6% reduction from the FY2019 program level. In inflation-adjusted FY2020 dollars, this proposed FY2020 program level would be 22.5% below the peak 2003 level. Some members of the scientific community have cited funding variability and uncertainty as a hindrance for advancing biomedical research. They have called for steady and predictable funding growth to support the multiyear nature of research. Others have questioned whether universities and other research institutions are too reliant on NIH funding and if institutions should diversify their funding sources or use institutional funds to pay for research. Aside from funding, other potential issues of for many in Congress and the research community may include allocating funding across disease types, areas of human health, and types of research; addressing congressional priorities and concerns, while ensuring the scientific merit and quality of NIH- funded research; helping new and early-stage investigators obtain their first independent research grants; maintaining the United States' role as a leader in biomedical research; balancing the public and private sectors' relative roles in biomedical Research and Development; and ensuring that research is conducted in a fair and transparent manner. This report provides background and analysis on NIH organization, mission, budget, and history; outlines the agency's major responsibilities; and discusses some of the issues facing Congress as it works to guide and monitor the nation's investment in medical research.
The Trump Administration has imposed additional tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, and imposed additional import restrictions on motor vehicles and uranium under three different U.S. trade authorities: Section 201, Section 232, and Section 301. The President has also proposed other import restrictions, including quotas and tariff-rate quotas, under these authorities, but the majority of the actions are in the form of ad-valorem tariff increases. President Trump's recently imposed tariff increases are of note because they are significantly higher than average U. S. tariffs and have resulted in retaliation of a similar magnitude by some of the countries whose exports to the United States have been subject to the tariff increases; they affect approximately 12% of annual U.s. imports and 8% of exports, magnitudes that could grow if additional proposed or pending actions are carried out, or decrease if additional negotiated solutions are achieved; they represent a significant shift from recent U. s. trade policy as no President has imposed tariffs under these Authorities in nearly two decades; and they have potentially significant implications for U.N., World Trade Organization (WTO) and bilateral and regional trade agreements, as well as U.R. economic activity and the global trading system as a whole. The Trump Administration's tariff actions have been the subject of numerous congressional questions and hearings, and have generated a significant amount of public debate. Many Members have expressed concern over what they view as an expansive use of the delegated tariff authority under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962, and some Members have introduced legislation in the 115th and 116th Congresses that would amend the current authority in a number of ways, including requiring a greater congressional role before tariffs may be imposed. All actions continue to be actively debated, as some other Members see a need for expanded presidential authority to ensure more reciprocal tariff treatment by U.L. trading partners and have introduced bills in the116th Congress to that effect. Senator Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, announced that he intends to "review the President's use of power under Sections 232 and 301" during the 116 th Congress. In addition to these tariff actions, President Trump has threatened to increase tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of imports from China under Section 301 of the WTO if a trade agreement is not reached by March 1, 2019, or potentially soon thereafter. China is a major focus of a Section 301 investigation and related tariff measures largely due to concerns over its intellectual property rights (IPR) and forced technology transfer practices, and the size of its bilateral trade deficit with the United states. China's government policies on technology and IPR have been longstanding U.K. concerns, and are cited by some firms as among the most challenging issues they face in doing business in China. Moreover, China is considered to be the largest global source of IP theft. On March 22, 2018, President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum on actions related to the Section 301 action. Described by the White House as a response to China's "economic aggression," the memorandum identified four broad Chinese IP-related policies to justify U.C. action under Section301, stating China uses joint venture requirements, foreign investment restrictions, and administrative review and licensing processes to force or pressure technology transfers from American companies; China uses discriminatory licensing processes, which generate large-scale technology transfer; and China conducts and supports cyber intrusions to gain access to valuable business information. The United States has also engaged or will engage in consultations at the WTO with some of its trading partners affected by the tariffs. Such consultations are a required first step in dispute settlement proceedings, which U.P. trading parties have initiated in response to the U.M. actions and trading partner retaliations. Since April 2018, a numberof trading partners have taken or proposed retaliatory actions, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), China, Turkey, and Russia, which have imposed retaliatory tariffs on a variety of goods and services, including some agricultural products, affecting approximately $126 billion of annual exports, using 2017 trade values. Congress has conducted oversight hearings on the Administration's actions and examined the potential economic and broader policy effects of the tariffs, including the potential impact on the global trade balance and the role of the federal government in the international trading system.
The U.S. corporate income tax is based on worldwide economic activity. If all of a corporation's economic activity is in the United States, then tax administration and compliance is relatively straightforward. Many corporations, however, operate in several jurisdictions, which creates complications for tax Administration and compliance. Further, corporations may actively choose where and how to organize to reduce their tax liabilities. Some of these strategies have been referred to as expatriation, inversions, and mergers. Achieving tax savings using an inversion became more difficult with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357). The JOBS Act denied or restricted the tax benefits of an inversions if the owners of the new company were not substantially different from the ownership of the original company. The act also allowed a firm to invert only if it had substantial business operations in the country where the new headquarters was to be located. Although the 2004 legislation largely prevented the types of inversions that drew attention prior to its adoption, several companies have successfully inverted in the past few years by using the substantive business operations mechanism or merging. Treasury regulations have subsequently limited the former mechanism. In 2014, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging or plans to merge with a non-U.S.-based firm, including Pfizer, Chiquita, and Omnicom (an advertising firm). Although the Pfizer and Omnicon mergers and Walgreens headquarters shifts ultimately did not take place, other firms announced mergers in the late spring and early summer. A number of firms in the medical device or pharmaceuticals fields announced merger or proposed mergers with a shift of headquarters: Medtronics, Salix, AbbVie, Mylan, and Hospira. In August 2014, concern about inversions increased with the announcement that Burger King was in talks with Tim Hortons, a Canadian firm, with the merged firm's headquarters in Canada. In September 2014, the Treasury Department released a notice of regulatory changes that would restrict some aspects of inversion or their benefits and indicated that other actions may follow. In November 2015, the Department of the Treasury announced additional regulatory restrictions. Although new inversions slowed significantly, others continued but in many cases have been structured to avoid the regulations by reducing ownership below 60%. Most notable of these is the proposed merger of Pfizer with Allergen in November 2015. Pfizer terminated the merger after the release of the April 4, 2016, regulations. In December 2017, a tax revision, often called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), made major changes to the corporate tax and the international tax rules, along with some specific revisions aimed at discouraging inversions. Although data for 2018 are not yet available, one planned inversion, by Assurant, Inc., was revised to retain the headquarters in theUnited States. Ohio-based Dana, Inc. announced plans to merger and move the headquarters to the U.K., although the merger would leave the U-S. shareholders with less than 60% ownership, and therefore not make them subject to anti-inversion penalties. A recent announcement indicated that the Dana merger was called off. Some firms may be considering reversing their headquarters decisions. The 2017 revision to the tax code included a reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% (reduced from 35%). This reduced the incentive for corporate inversions by reducing the tax rate applied to repatriated earnings. However, the benefit of a lowered rate is negligible relative to the benefit to corporate taxpayers afforded by territorial tax systems, when income earned in low- or no-tax foreign jurisdictions is never subject to U. S. tax.
In recent years, the federal government has annually made available more than $100 billion in federal grants, loans, and work-study funds to millions of students to help cover the cost of higher education. As Congress continues to focus on expanding access to postsecondary education through federal student aid policies, understanding various characteristics of the population enrolling in postsecondaryEducation may be helpful in informing policy deliberations. In academic year (AY) 2015-2016, there were approximately 19.3 million students enrolled as undergraduates in post secondary education in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The composition of the current undergraduate population, how the composition has changed over time, and the types of institutions in which students enroll are issues that are likely to be of interest to Congress as it considers the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA). This report focuses on the income of the undergraduate student population. The analysis presented in this report relies on two data sources: the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). NPSAS is a nationally representative study of postsecondary students that focuses on how students finance their education. It is conducted by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and is administered every four years. The most recent study available covers the AY2015-2016 school year, which ran from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016. In this report, the data are used to explore the income characteristics of students enrolled at postsecondary institutions and the extent to which income is related to other student demographics, such as race and dependency status. The report also explores the relationship between income and the type of institution(s) attended. The data suggest that low-income students are enrolling at higher levels than previously observed. Specifically, the number of undergraduate students with income below 100% of the poverty guidelines grew from approximately 4 million in the 2007-2008 school year to 6.7 million in AY2011-2012, an increase of nearly 70%. The number of students in the middle- and upper-income categories has declined somewhat in recent years. This could suggest that there are challenges that these students face in enrolling that may not be addressed in current federal policies. There is also growing interest in the degree to which students who enroll are completing a postsecondary credential. Research suggests that private nonprofit and public four-year institutions tend to have higher completion rates than public two-year and for-profit institutions. Policymakers face consideration of whether federal policies could play a role in encouraging students at various income levels to enroll at the highest performing types of schools. Data also show that undergraduate students historically labeled as "non-traditional" and minority students constitute about 50%. Some research suggests that non-traditional and minority Students face a unique set of challenges when enrolling and completing postsecondary Education. This report will not be updated.
Medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries. It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under 65. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare consists of four distinct parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance, or HI) covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. The HI trust fund is mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers. Since 2013, workers with income of more than $200,000 per year for single tax filers (or over $250,000 for joint tax filer) pay an additional 0.9%. Part B (Supplementary medical insurance, or SMI) covers physician services, outpatient services, and home health and preventive services. Part C (Medicare Advantage, or MA) is a private plan option for beneficiaries that covers all Parts A and B services, except hospice. Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits. Funding is included in the SMI trust fund and is financed through beneficiary premiums, general revenues, and state transfer payments. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that total Medicare spending in 2019 will be about $772 billion; of this amount, approximately $749 billion will be spent on benefits. About 28% of Medicare benefit spending is for hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient services. CBO also estimates that federal Medicare spending (after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts) will be approximately $637 billion in 2019, accounting for about 14% of total federal spending and 3% of GDP. Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. In response to these concerns, Congress may consider a range of Medicare reform options, from making changes within the current structure, including modifying provider payments and revising existing oversight and regulatory mechanisms, to restructuring the entire program. Medicare is expected to be a high-priority issue in the current Congress. The committees of jurisdiction for the mandatory spending (benefits) portion of Medicare are the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the House committees on Energy and Commerce. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have jurisdiction over the discretionary spending used to administer and oversee the program.
The Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA; P.L. 89-329, as amended) established Pell Grants as the foundation for all federal need-based student aid awarded to undergraduates. The HEA Title IV Pell Grant program is administered by the U.S. Department of Education's (ED) Office of Pell Grants and provides financial aid to students enrolled in postsecondary education programs through institutions of higher education (IHEs). Pell Grants are available to students who are enrolled in programs that focus on high-demand occupations, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and who are otherwise Pell-eligible except that they are incarcerated in a federal or state prison. Prior to 1992, all incarcerated individuals were eligible to receive aid under Title IV of the HEA, including Pell Grants. In 2008, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which prohibited prisoners who upon completion of a period of incarceration for a forcible or nonforcible sexual offense were subject to an involuntary civil commitment from receiving Pell Grant aid. This prohibition was partially in response to the fact that 54 individuals who were civilly committed sex offenders in Florida had received Pell Grants in 2004. To be eligible for a Pell Grant, a student must meet requirements established by Title IV (e.g., a high school diploma or a general educational development (GED) certificate) or have completed an eligible homeschool program. Some of these requirements apply to all of the Title IV student aid programs, and some are specific to the Pell Grants program. For example, students must either be enrolled in an eligible career pathway program or have been initially enrolled in a postsecondary program prior to July 1, 2012. In 2015, ED initiated the Second Chance Pell Experiment to determine if access to Pell Grants would increase the enrollment of incarcerated individuals in high-quality education programs. In February 2019, ED announced that the experiment would be extended an additional year but did not provide an estimate of the release of any data or an evaluation of the program. In April 2019, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on the status of the experiment (hereafter referred to as the 2019 GAO report). According to the report, in AY2017-2018, 59 schools disbursed $22.3 million in Pell Grants to over 6,000 prisoners under the experiment. Schools reported various challenges implementing the experiment including, but not limited to, prisoners not being registered for Selective Service, prisoners being in default on a HEA student loan, and prisoners and school staff having difficulty proving prisoner income and financial need. There are several issues policymakers might consider before expanding Pell Grant eligibility to some or all federal and state prisoners, including overall program costs, whether the federal government should support more research on the effects of post-incarceration education on recidivism, obstacles to providing access to post-release education in a correctional environment, and barriers returning prisoners might face when trying to find post-released employment related to their education. This report provides background on Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals. It also discusses the educational attainment of prisoners and their participation in and completion of educational programs offered to them.
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334, the 2018 farm bill) reauthorized and amended all of the major U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agricultural conservation programs. Most of these programs are authorized to receive mandatory funding (i.e., they do not require an annual appropriation), and include funding authorities that expire with most other farm bill programs at the end of FY2023. Other types of conservation programs—such as watershed programs, emergency programs, and technical assistance—are authorized in legislation other than the farm bill. These programs are not generally addressed in the context of a farm bill and are not covered in detail in this report. This report provides a general discussion of programmatic-specific amendments made to various conservation programs and subprograms. For a detailed section-by-section analysis of amendments in the 2018 bill, including statutory and U. S. Code citations, see the Appendix. Unless otherwise noted, conservation programs discussed in this section are authorized for mandatory funding through the borrowing authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). For additional analysis of conservation program funding, please see the "Budget and Baseline" section of the report. The bulk of mandatory spending for conservation is authorized for working lands and land retirement activities. While recent farm bills have increased funding for easement and partnership programs, they remain relatively small compared to three main programs—the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), and Land Retirement Program (CRP). Over time, periods of high commodity prices, changing land rental rates, and new conservation technologies have led to a shift in farm bill conservation policy away from land retirement and toward an increased focus on working lands programs. Much of this shift occurred following the 2008 farm bills and continued in the 2014 farm bill as the level of total mandatory program funding for land retirement programs declined relative to working lands program funding. Increasingly, the separation between land retirement Programs and working lands Programs has become blurred by an increase in compatible use allowances for grazing and pasture use. Most conservation and wildlife organizations support both land retirement, working lands, and easement programs; however, the appropriate "mix" continues to be a subject of debate. Additionally, some conservation program supporters are divided over the relative benefits of shorter-term CRP versus longer-term easements. Supporters of easement Programs cite a more cost-effective investment in sustainable ecosystems for long-term wildlife and land preservation benefits. Opponents of easements cite the increased flexibility and broader participation compared to permanent or long- term easement Program programs. The 2018 farm bills conservation title is considered budget neutral over the ten-year baseline and generally reallocates funding among the larger existing programs. However, it is projected to increase funding in the first five years (+$555 million over FY2019-FY2023) and decrease funding over the last five years (-$561 million). The conservation title makes up $60 billion of the total $867 billion projected over 10 years, which is 7% of that total.
In the modern dual banking system, national banks are regulated by national banking authorities and state banking authorities are the primary regulators of state-chartered banks. This complex regulatory architecture has resulted in a "symbiotic system" with both state regulation of national banks and federal regulation of state banks. In order to minimize the risk of bank runs, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits at regulated institutions up to certain limits and regulates those institutions to ensure their safety and soundness. Because federal law requires national banks to obtain FDIC insurance and all states impose that same requirement on the banks they charter, the FDIC plays a key role in regulating the banking system. However, because of marijuana's status under federal law, many banks have refused to serve marijuana businesses even when those businesses operate in compliance with state law. While some small banks have offered accounts to marijuana businesses, an estimated 70 percent of marijuana businesses remain unbanked. As a result, many marijuana businesses reportedly operate entirely in cash, raising concerns about tax collection and public safety. These perceived problems have attracted congressional interest. In March 2019, the House Committee on Financial Services approved H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, which would create a "safe harbor" under which federal banking regulators could not take various adverse actions against depository institutions for serving marijuana businesses that comply with applicable state laws ("cannabis-related legitimate businesses"). Variations on some of the bill's provisions have been incorporated into broader marijuana-related legislation. The Responsibly Addressing Marijuana Policy Gap Act of2019 (S. 421 and H. R. 1119) would eliminate federal criminal penalties for persons who engage in various marijuana- related activities in compliancewith state law and create a safe harbor from adverse regulatory action for depository Institutions that serve Marijuana businesses. Another Senate bill—S. 1028, the STATES Act—would provide that the Controlled Substances Act's (CSA's) Marijuana-related provisions do not apply to persons acting in compliance With state marijuana regulation, subject to certain exceptions. While the bill does not have the type of "safe Harbor" for depositories institutions in S. 421, S. 928, or H.J.Res. 26, it contains a "Rule of Construction" clarifying that conduct in compliance in accordance with the legislation shall not serve as the basis for federal money laundering charges or criminal forfeiture under the CSA. In July 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a Policy Statement announcing that it will begin accepting applications for "special purpose national bank charters" (SPNB charters) from FinTech companies that are engaged in "the business of banking" but do not take deposits. In the Policy Statement, the OCC explained that the National Bank Act (NBA) provides it "broad authority" to grant national bankcharters to institutions that engage in the "business of banking"—a category that includes paying checks and lending money. The OCC accordingly concluded that it has the statutory authority to grant SPNB chartering to FinTech firms engaged in these core banking activities. Critics of the policy have contended that FinTech's interest in such charters "is virtually entirely about avoiding state consumer protection laws," and that "[f]ederal chartering should not be a move to eviscerate" such laws. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the New York Department of Financial Services responded to an early OCC proposal to charter Fin tech companies by filing suits that remain pending. Policymakers have also turned their attention to how federal law affects traditional banks' responses to changes in state law—namely, state-level efforts to legalize marijuana. While a number of states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, federal law criminalizes the drug's sale, distribution, and possession, in addition to the aiding and abetting of such activities. Federal law also criminalizes money laundering, making it unlawful to: (1) conduct a financial transaction involving the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity knowing that the transaction is designed to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership or the control of the proceeds, or to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law; or (2) knowingly engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000 that is derived from specified unlawful activities. Finally, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and associated
The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill includes funding and other provisions for agencies and programs in three separate federal departments and for numerous related agencies. The Interior bill typically contains three primary appropriations titles and a fourth title with general provisions. Title I provides funding for most Department of the Interior (DOI) agencies, many of which manage land and other natural resource or regulatory programs. Title II contains appropriations and administrative provisions for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Title III funds 23 agencies in other departments, such as the Forest Service and the Indian Health Service; arts and cultural agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution; and various other organizations and entities. A fourth title of the bill, General Provisions, typically contains additional guidance and direction for agencies in the bill. For FY2019, President Trump requested $28.34 billion for the more than 30 agencies and entities funded in the Interior bill. This was $7.28 billion (25.7%) more than was enacted for FY2018 ($36.59 billion) but $975.4 million, or 2.7%, less than the FY2019 enacted appropriation of $35.61 billion (Division E of P.L. 116-6, enacted on February 15, 2019). The FY2019 appropriation was $300.0 million (0.8%) above the President's request, $305.5 million more than the level passed by the House in H.R. 6147 (115th Congress), and $301.0 billion (0,8%) below the Senate-passed level. The FY2018 total included $1.29 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief. The President's FY2019 request also included $3.79 billion in discretionary appropriations for Wildland Fire Management (WFM) of DOI and the FS, a 12.9% decrease from the FY2018 enacted level ($4.35 billion). However, the President also sought a discretionary cap adjustment to the discretionary spending limits in law, so that funding for certain wildland fire suppression activities would not be subject to the limits. The cap adjustment was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, and is scheduled to go into effect in FY2020. Neither the House nor the Senate version of H.J.Res. 31, enacted in the 116th Congress, contained the cap adjustment. The House and Senate did not support appropriations for FY2019 for the FS or DOI FLAME accounts. The FLAME account received an emergency supplemental appropriation in FY2018 of $342 million, and the Senate bill did not include any appropriations for the account. The total FY2019 appropriations for Interior, environment, and related agencies totaled $36.57 billion. This total included a total of $2.02 billion for WFM, $8.06 billion for EPA, $13.74 billion for "Related Agencies" in Title III, and $791 million in Title IV for certain activities of EPA. The enacted appropriation for Interior and Environment for FY2017 was $37.55 billion, including $1 billion in disaster relief and $35 billion in regular appropriations. The Administration requested a total FY2018 regular appropriation for these agencies of $36 million, including a $1 million cap adjustment for wildland fires, and a $2 billion emergency supplemental for disaster aid. The regular FY2018 appropriation included $35 million in disaster supplemental funding for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and $766 million for EPA. In addition, the Administration proposed a budget restructuring within the BLM Management of Lands and Resources account, to increase flexibility, cost savings, and program integration. The Senate, but not the House, would have adopted this restructuring. In the House- and Senate versions of the FY2017 regular appropriations bill, funding for BLM would have increased by 4.1% and 0.9%, respectively, for the Management of Land and Resources and for Land Acquisition, but the House would have reduced funds for that purpose. In contrast, the Senate would have provided an increase for the agency's Land Acquisition program, but reduced funding for other programs, including Science and Technology and State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG, including categorical grants).
This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) program. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $9,925.5 million (i.e., about $9.9 billion) in procurement and advance procurement (AP) funding for the program. Decisions that Congress makes on procurement of Virginia- class boats could substantially affect U.S. Navy capabilities and funding requirements, and the U. S. shipbuilding industrial base. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which theVirginia-class program and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke.

In the 116th Congress, the House passed three bills that would commission studies concerning the use of virtual currencies for illicit purposes. H.R. 56, the Financial Technology Protection Act, would establish an Independent Financial Technology Task Force to Combat Terrorism and Illicit Financing (Task Force) led by the Treasury Secretary. After passing the House in January 2019, the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. A second bill, H. R. 428, the Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists' Use of Virtual Currencies Act, similarly would commission an analysis of the use by terrorists of virtual currency. The bill would direct the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis to conduct a "threat assessment" analyzing "the actual and potential threat posed by individuals using virtual currency to carry out activities in furtherance of an act of terrorism, including the provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization." The bill also would establish two programs to incentivize members of the public to assist the federal government's efforts to combat the illicit use of digital currencies. The bills would establish a reward of up to $450,000 for persons who "provide[] information leading to the conviction of an individual involved with terrorist use ofdigital currencies," and a grant program for the development of tools and programs to detect "terrorist and illicit use" of digital currency. Finally, the Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act (the FIND trafficking Act) would direct a study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to facilitate sex and drug trafficking. After passed the House, the bills were referred to various committees in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The House passed a third bill, the FinCEN Improvement Act of 2019, which would clarify that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's (FinCEN's) statutory power to coordinate with foreign financial intelligence units on antiterrorism and anti-money laundering (AML) initiatives "includ[es] matters involving emerging technologies or value that substitutes for currency." The House also passed a bill that would create a safe harbor from federal and state money transmitter licensing and registration requirements for certain "blockchain developers" who do not have control over users' digital currency in the regular course of business. The "Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act" would provide that such persons shall not be treated as "money transmitters," money transmitters, money service businesses, or any other State or Federal legal designation[s] requiring licensing or registration as a condition to acting as a blockchain developer or provider of a blockchain service." In addition to imposing various AML requirements on "financial institutions," federal law also criminalizes money laundering and certain related conduct. Specifically, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1) (Section 1956) makes it unlawful for a person who knows that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity to "conduct[] or attempt[] to conduct such a financial transactions which in fact involves the Proceeds of specified unlawful activity"—(A) (i) with the intent to promote the carrying on ofspecified unlawful activity; or (ii) with intent to engage in conduct constituting [tax evasion or tax fraud]; or (B) knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part—(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds, or (II) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or federal law. In addition, the Senate passed the Financial Services Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (S.Rept. 113-291), which would establish federal registration and reporting requirements for "money transmitting businesses" (i.e., money services businesses) that facilitate cash transactions.
Between 1819 and 1857, the room currently called Statuary Hall served as the Hall of the House of Representatives. In 1879, it was converted into additional space for the Library of Congress, which was still housed in the Capitol. It is now known as the House Wing of the Capitol and is located in the east side of the U.S. Capitol complex. The House Speaker has the authority to assign unappropriated rooms (i.e., rooms not already assigned to a committee, House leadership, or an officer of theHouse) to the House and to use them for official House business. Since 1911, the Speaker has generally authorized use of rooms in the House wing not otherwise appropriated. Since 2005, 170 events have been held in Statuary hall. These events include receptions and dinners, ceremonies, media events, and memorial services. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) examined these events and found that 57.6% were receptions or dinners, hosted by both official congressional entities and private groups. Ceremonies include presentations of awards, unveiling of official portraits, commemorations of event anniversaries, formal wreath layings, and prayer services. Media events include media availability after a presidential address to a joint session of Congress in the Senate chamber, as well as the annual National Moment of Remembrance. Since 2013, 13 memorial services (7.6%) for current or former Members of Congress have also been held. The Appendix provides a chronological list of these events, the date of the event, the event type, and a brief description. This report will be updated as events warrant.

In March 2015, Saudi Arabia established a coalition of nations (hereinafter referred to as the Saudi-led coalition or the coalition) to engage in military operations in Yemen against the Ansar Allah/Houthi movement and loyalists of the previous president of Yemen, the late Ali Abdullah Saleh. During 2014, the United States joined Saudi Arabia in demanding that Houthi forces reverse their campaign to occupy the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, but the rapid onset of hostilities in March 2015 forced the Obama Administration to react quickly. Since then, Congress has taken an active role in debating and overseeing U.S. policy in the Arabian Peninsula. Members have considered legislative proposals seeking to reduce Yemeni civilian casualties resulting from the coalition's operations; improve deteriorating humanitarian conditions; end restrictions on the flow of goods and humanitarian aid; combat Iranian support for the Houthis; preserve maritime security in the Bab al Mandab Strait; and/or support continued Saudi-Led coalition and U.N.-brokered efforts to counter Al Qaeda and Islamic State forces in Yemen. Beyond Yemen, many Members have appeared to view the conflict through the prism of a broader regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the U. S. effort to limit Iran's malign regional influence. In addition, some Members have expressed concern about what they perceive as problems in the bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia, a concern that deepened after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government personnel in October 2018. Congress has considered but has not enacted proposals to curtail or condition U.s. defense sales to Saudi Arabia. In the 115th Congress, the Senate passed S.J.Res. 54 (56-41) on December 13, 2018, which, among other things, directed the President to remove United States forces from hostilities in Yemen, except for those engaged in operations directed at Al Qaeda or associated forces. The House twice narrowly approved rules resolutions containing provisions that would have made similar resolutions to remove the President from hostilities from Yemen ineligible for expedited consideration (H.Ress. 1142 and H. Res. 1176). The Senate also passed a similar resolution (S.J.-Res. 69) at the conclusion of the 115 th Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also proposed new legislation to place conditions on the use of funds to support the coalition in Yemen in June 2018. The provision was incorporated as Section 1266 of the version of the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that it reported to the Senate on June 5, 2018 (S.-2987). The provision also passed by both the House and Senate as Section1290 of the conference version of H.R. 5515, which was signed into law as P.L. 115-232 in mid-August 2018. In a statement accompanying the President's signing of the law, President Trump objected to Section 1290, stating the Administration's view that such provisions "encompass only actions for which such advance certification or notification is feasible and consistent" with "[his] exclusive constitutional authorities as Commander in Chief and as the sole representative of the Nation in foreign affairs." The pace and scale of fighting on the ground increased dramatically by the summer of 2018. On June 12, the coalition launched "Operation Golden Victory," aimed at retaking the Red Sea port city of Hudaydah. As coalition forces engaged Houthi militants in and around the port city, humanitarian organizations warned that if port operation ceased, famine could become widespread throughout northern Yemen. On August 9, the Saudi led coalition conducted an airstrike that hit a bus in a market near Dahyan, Yemen, in the northern Sa'ada governorate adjacent to the Saudi border. The strike reportedly killed 51 people, 40 of whom were children. The coalition claims that its airstrike was a "legitimate military operation" and conducted in response to a Houthi missile attack on the Saudi city of Jizan a day earlier that killed a Yemeni national in the kingdom. On September 12, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a certification that would allow the in-flight refueling of coalition aircraft to continue, per the terms of the NDAA. On November 9, Secretary Mattis announced that the coalition would use its own military capabilities—rather than U.O. capabilities—to conduct refueling in support of its operations. Though fighting continued along several fronts, in December 2018, Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General for Yemen Martin Griffiths brokered a cease
The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program is a joint federal-state program authorized by the Social Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271) and administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) through the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). The UC program is financed by federal taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under each state's State Unemployment tax Act (SUTA). The 0.6% effective net FUTA tax paid by employers on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings (equaling no more than $42 per worker per year) funds federal and state administrative costs, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, the federal share (50%) of EB payments, and state employment services. Federal law requires that the maximum state tax rate be at least 5.4%. Federal law also requires each employer's state tax rates to be based on the amount of UC paid to former employees (known as "experience rating"). Within these broad requirements, each state has great flexibility in determining its SUTA structure. Generally, the more UC benefits paid out to its former employees, the higher the tax rate of the employer, up to a maximum established by state law. The sequester order required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P. L. 112-25) and implemented on March 1, 2013 (after being delayed by P.L., 112-240), affected some but not all types of UI expenditures. Regular UC, UCX, and UCFE payments are not subject to the sequester reductions. EB and most forms of administrative funding are subject to these reductions. The FY2019 sequestration order requires a 6.2% reduction in all nonexempt nondefense mandatory expenditures, but no sequestration reductions are applicable to discretionary programs, projects, and activities. As a result, EB expenditures are required to be reduced 6.1% for weeks of unemployment during FY2019. The lapse in federal appropriations that occurred from December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, caused a partial government shutdown. During this lapse in appropriations, agencies without funding furloughed federal employees, and many federal employees excepted from furlough were working without pay. Federal employees who are in furlong status on account of a government shutdown may be eligible for Unemployment Compensation for Excepted Federal Employees (UCFE) benefits. However, according to guidance from DOL, excepted federal workers who are performing services (but workingwithout pay) would generally be ineligible for UCFE benefits based on states' definitions of "unemployment." In this climate, there has been congressional interest in providing UI assistance through the UI system. For example, H.J.Res. 28, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2019, 2019 (H.R. 115-123), passed the House on January 23, 2019. On March 7,2019, Representative Karen Bass introduced the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of2019 (H,R. 1585), which would require states to consider an individual who quit employment because of sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be eligible to receive UC benefits. The House passed H.R., 1585, on April 4,2019. On April 9,19, Representative Stephanie Murphy introduced the Building on Reemployment Improvements to Deliver Good Employment (BRIDGE) for Workers Act, which would extend eligibility to any claimant of unemployment benefits, including those profiled as likely to exhaust benefits (rather than limiting eligibility to those who were profiled to be "most in need"). The House also passed H,R., 1759, on March 14, 2019; the Senate passed S. 24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2018 (enacted January 16, 2019). This report provides a brief overview of the UC program. It will be updated as legislative activity warrants.
The U.S. housing finance system supports about $10 trillion in outstanding single-family residential mortgage debt and over $1 trillion in multifamily mortgage debt. Two major players in the housing financesystem are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that were created by Congress to provide liquidity to the mortgage market. In 2008, during the housing and mortgage market turmoil that followed the economic recession of 2007-2009, the two GSEs entered voluntary conservatorship overseen by their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Since then, policymakers have largely agreed on the need for comprehensive housing finance reform legislation that would transform or eliminate the GSE's role in the system. While there is broad agreement on certain principles of housing Finance Reform—such as increasing the private sector's role and maintaining access to affordable mortgages for creditworthy households—there is disagreement over how best to achieve these objectives and over the technical details of how a restructured housing Finance system should operate. During the 115th Congress, Members on the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction and Administration officials indicated that housing Finance reform would be a priority. However, little formal legislative action on the issue took place, and in July 2018, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested at a House Financial Services Committee hearing that housing finance Reform would be an issue in the 116th Congress. In September 2018, House Financial Service Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling released a discussion draft of a comprehensive housing Finance Act (H.R. 6746) with some bipartisan support. Chairman Hensander also indicated plans to reintroduce the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act (PATH Act) from the 113th Congress (P.L. 115-97), which takes a different approach to housing finance reforms, as an alternative to the discussion draft bill. The Financial Services committee held a hearing on the draft bill in December 2018. In addition to considering the role of Fannie and Freddie, any future housing finance legislation could also consider changes to the Federal housing Administration (FHA). FHA is a part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and insures certain mortgages made by private lenders against the possibility of borrower default. By insuring these mortgages, FHA helps to make affordable mortgages more available to borrowers who might otherwise not be well-served by the private mortgage market, such as borrowers with low down payments. FHA charges borrowers both upfront and annual fees, referred to as mortgage insurance premiums, in exchange for this insurance. These fees are supposed to cover the costs of paying a claim to a lender if an FHA-insured mortgage defaults and goes to foreclosure. By law, the HUD Secretary has a responsibility to ensure that the FHA single- family mortgage insurance fund remains financially sound and that the fund is in compliance with a requirement that it maintain a capital ratio of at least 2%. FHA raised the premiums it charges several times in the years during and following the housing market turmoil in response to concerns about rising mortgage delinquency rates and FHA's ability to maintain compliance with the capital ratio requirement. It then lowered the annual premiums in 2015 as mortgage delinquencies began to decrease and its financial position stabilized. The level of the premiums charged by FHA has implications for the affordability and availability of FHAinsured mortgages for certain homebuyers, on the one hand, and for the financial health of the FHFA insurance fund on the other; setting the appropriate premium level involves balancing these considerations. Early in January 2017, HUD announced that it planned to decrease the annual mortgage insurance premium it charged for new mortgages that closed on or after January 27, 2017. On January 20, 2017, the first day of the Trump Administration, HUD suspended the planned decrease before it went into effect. In its Annual Report to Congress on the Financial Status of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund), FHA stated that had the planned premium decrease gone into effect, the estimated capital ratio for the MMI Fund would have fallen below the statutorily mandated 2% for FY2017. The estimated lower capital ratio would have been due to a combination of (1) less premium revenue coming into the fund as a result of the lower premiums and (2) an increase in the total dollar amount of mortgages that had been insured as result of more borrowers obtaining FHA insured mortgages due to lower premiums. The FHA report also suggests, however, that reverse mortgages insured by reverse mortgages are having a disproportionately negative
Federal policymakers statutorily established the U.S. Department of Education (ED) as a Cabinet-level agency in 1980. Its mission is to "promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access." Like most federal agencies, ED receives funds in support of its mission through various federal budget and appropriations processes. These processes are complex. For example, ED is provided both mandatory and discretionary appropriations; it is annually provided forward funds and advance appropriations for some—but not all—discretionary programs; it awards both formula and competitive grants; and a portion of ED's budget subsidizes student loan costs (through both direct loans and loan guarantees). Because of this complexity, analyzing the budget for ED requires an understanding of a broad range of federal budget, appropriations, and program-related concepts. This report provides an introduction to these concepts as they are used specifically in the context of the congressional appropriations process for ED. It was designed for readers who are new or returning to the topic of ED budget and Appropriations. The first section of this report provides a brief introduction to key terms and concepts in the federal budget process with special relevance for ED, as well as closely related questions about education funding in general. The second section answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about federal funding for the department. The third section includes a brief description of, and links to, reports and documents that provide more information about budget, budget process, and appropriations concepts. The fourth section provides an overview of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25), as amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018, BBA 2018), which increased the discretionary budget authority for ED in FY2018 and FY2019. The fifth and final section of the report discusses the BCA and its impact on ED funding levels. The sixth section provides information about the Congressional Research Service's (CRS's) tracking of federal education funding through the annual Digest of Education Statistics ( Digest). The seventh and final part of the section discusses the congressional budget resolution, which sets procedural parameters for the consideration of discretionary and mandatory spending legislation. The budget resolution does not provide actual funding for ED or any other purpose, but instead allocates funding by congressional committee and appropriations subcommittee. It is not possible for CRS to determine the amount of funding assumed for ED (or education-related purposes) in the annual budget resolution because the procedural parameters in the budget resolution allocate funding by committee and not by department, and because the jurisdiction of the relevant authorizing committees and appropriations subcommittees encompasses more than ED. In addition, although the basis of those authorizing committee and subcommittee allocations is a distribution of funding based on "functional categories," those functional categories do not neatly correspond to ED or education- related purposes. (Functional categories are discussed in the section "How much does the federal government spend on education? ") As a result, absent specific information with regard to the budget resolutions from the House or the Senate budget committees, it is not able to determine amounts of funding that are assumed by the budgetresolution.
The 116th Congress may conduct oversight and deliberate on authorizations and appropriations legislation related to water resource development, management, and protection. Demands on available water supplies have heightened local and regional water-use conflicts throughout the country, particularly in the West and Southeast. Development pressures, droughts and floods, and concerns about changing hydrology and climate change engender nonfederal interest in federal financial and technical assistance for water resource science and projects. Congress historically has played a role in water resources through authorization of and appropriations for regional and site-specific projects and activities. Some of the projects are for facilitating navigation and expanding water supplies for irrigation and other uses. Other projects are aimed at reducing flood and drought losses and restoring aquatic ecosystems. Congress principally has directed either the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) in the Department of the Interior (DOI) or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) inthe Department of Defense to plan and construct the existing stock of large federal water resource projects. Reclamation has constructed and operated a variety of multipurpose water projects in the 17 states west of the Mississippi River. These projects include the California Central Valley Project (CVP) and major dams on the Colorado River (Hoover Dam) and Columbia River (Grand Coulee Dam) systems, among others. USACE constructs projects nationwide that primarily seek to improve navigation, reduce flood damages, and restore aquatic ecosystems, among other purposes. In addition, Congress authorizes and funds selected science and monitoring activities at multiple federal agencies, including Reclamation, USACE, and DOI's U. S. Geological Survey (USGS). In addition to these agencies, other federal agencies have water-related programs and activities; these other agencies are largely beyond the scope of this report. This report first discusses some broad categories of water resource topics relevant to the116th Congress—projects and activities of USACE and western water and Reclamation; Indian water rights settlements; international waters shared with Canada and Mexico; and water resourceScience at USGS. The report next covers the following crosscutting topics: funding and financing aging and new projects; changing from federal infrastructure projects to federal partnerships; protecting and restoring the environment; flood resilience and natural and nature-based infrastructure; and recharging groundwater. It concludes with a discussion of some of the broader water resource policy issues that may be of interest to the 116 th Congress, such as the federal role in maintaining the performance and safety of existing water resource infrastructure, and the role of science, observation, and monitoring in water resource management.
Congress has been active in establishing federal policy for the agricultural sector on an ongoing basis since the 1930s. Over the years, as economic conditions and technology have evolved, Congress has regularly revisited agricultural policy through periodic farm legislation. Across these decades, the breadth of policy areas addressed through such farm bills has expanded beyond providing support for a limited number of agricultural commodities to include establishing programs and policies that address a broad spectrum of related areas. These include agricultural conservation, credit, rural development, domestic nutrition assistance, trade and international food aid, organic agriculture, forestry, and support for beginning and veteran farmers and ranchers, among others. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334), known as the "2018 farm bill," was enacted on December 20, 2018, approximately eight months after the bill was introduced. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected at enactment that outlays of the 2018 farm bill will amount to $428 billion over the five-year life of the law (FY2019-FY2023). Most of this projected spending—$326 million, or 76%—is in the nutrition title for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The remaining 24%—$102 billion of projected outlays—stems primarily from agricultural programs, including crop insurance, farm commodity programs, and conservation. CBO estimated that in its first five years, the enacted 2018 farm bills will increase spending by $1.8 billion, compared with a simple extension of the 2014 farm bill, but that this initial increase will be entirely offset in the second five years of the budget window. CBO also estimated that the conference agreement for the 2018 bill will be budget neutral over a 10-year period (FY 2019- FY2028). This report provides an analysis of the budgetary implications of both bills, followed by summaries identifying some of the changes contained in the enacted farm bill compared with prior law. These summaries are followed by tables containing a title-by-title analysis of all of the policies and provisions in the bill compared to the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 2 and with the expired 2014 farm bills. The enacted 2018 bill continues a tradition of multi-year farm bills that would establish policy for a broad array of agriculture and nutrition assistance programs. To this end, the bill addresses agriculture and food policy across 12 titles. These titles cover commodity support programs, agricultural conservation (including conservation programs and conservation Stewardship Program), agricultural conservation and trade programs, nutrition assistance (including nutrition programs and nutrition programs), credit (including farm loan programs and the State Agricultural Loan Mediation Program), rural development (including broadband deployment, opioid abuse and rural health, and business and infrastructure development), trade and food aid (including international food assistance and agricultural export programs), forestry, horticulture, and a variety of other policies and initiatives, such as research and extension programs, crop insurance and crop disaster assistance, and organic agriculture. The law also includes a number of provisions that further facilitate the commercial cultivation, processing, and marketing of industrial hemp.
Both Congress and the executive branch have employed a variety of means to establish independence for certain criminal investigations and prosecutions. The use of special prosecutors, independent counsels, and special counsels all have allowed for the investigation of executive branch misconduct. Nonetheless, efforts to provide independence for prosecutors from executive branch control often raise constitutional questions. In turn, proposals to statutorily protect a special counsel from removal thus raise important, but unresolved, constitutional questions about the separation of powers. As a general matter, simply insulating a future special prosecutor from removal except for "good cause" appears consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion in Morrison v. Olson. To the extent the functional reasoning of that case might depart from the current case and apply to current counsel for specified reasons, however, a more formal approach to the question might raise constitutional objections. Likewise, constitutional objections might arise against proposals aimed to insulate a current or future special counsel in a manner beyond the framework approved in Morrison. This report provides a brief historical background on the use of independent investigations of alleged wrongdoing by executive branch officials, as well as a brief discussion of the role of the Attorney General in appointing and removing a special prosecutor. It also discusses the legal issues raised by the current Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations governing the appointment and removal of a special Counsel. The report concludes with a discussion of some of the constitutional questions that might arise if Congress were to enact legislation to protect a current special counsel or a future one from the President's removal, or to establish a judicial role in the removal of such a counsel. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33487, Independent Counsels: Background and Legal Issues, by [author name scrubbed] (pdf). This report will be updated as warranted by major developments in the special counsel and criminal investigation fields.

In addition, the report will briefly address the appointment of a new special counsel, the scope of the existing special counsel's authority, and the legal implications of the current DOJ special counsel regulations.
Political and economic developments in Cuba and U.S. policy toward the island nation, located 90 miles from the United States, have been significant congressional concerns for many years. Since the end of the Cold War, Congress has played an active role in shaping policy toward Cuba, first with the enactment of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 (CDA; P.L. 102-484, Title XVII) and then with the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996. Both measures tightened economic sanctions on Cuba that had first been imposed in the early 1960s; however, both measures also provided road maps for normalization of relations, dependent on significant political and economic changes in Cuba. In December 2014, President Obama announced a major shift in U.N. relations with Cuba that moved away from a sanctions-based policy aimed at isolating Cuba toward a policy of engagement and a normalization. The policy shift led to the restoration of diplomatic relations, the rescission of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism, and the easing of some restrictions on travel and commerce with Cuba. There was mixed reaction in Congress, with some Members of Congress supporting the change and others opposing it. Legislative initiatives in the 114th Congress in 2015-2016 reflected this policy divide, with a number of bills introduced that would have further eased economic sanctions and others that would has blocked the policy shift and introduced new sanctions; ultimately no action was taken on either policy approach. President Trump announced a new policy approach toward Cuba in June 2017 that partially rolled back efforts to normalize relations and imposed new sanctions, including restrictions on the permissible category of people-to-people educational travel to Cuba and on transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military. In November 2017, the Treasury and Commerce Departments issued amended regulations to implement the new policy. The new policy also keeps in place the Obama Administration's action ending the so-called wet foot/dry foot policy, which had encouraged thousands of undocumented Cuban migrants to attempt to enter the United states since the mid-1990s. In January 2017, President Trump ended the "wet foot/ dry foot" policy, under which Cuban migrants who were intercepted at sea attempting to reach the UnitedStates were returned to Cuba, whereas those who were found to be in the country on shore were generally allowed to stay in the UnitedS. Under the 2017 change in policy, Cuban nationals who attempt to entered the United Sates illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief are now subject to removal. The Cuban government agreed to begin accepting the return of Cuban migrants whose have been ordered removed. In the 116th Congress, some Members have called on the Trump Administration to reestablish the Cuban Medical Professional Parole (CMPP) program, which allowed Cuban medical professionals who defected from Cuba's foreign medical missions in third countries to be approved for entry into theUnited States. In 2018, President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez succeeded Raúl Castro in April 2018 after Castro completed his second five-year term as president. Cuba does not have direct elections for president; instead, Cuba's legislature, the National Assembly of People's Power, selected DíAZ- canel as president of the country's 31-member Council of State, which, pursuant to Cuba's constitution (Article 74), makes him head of state and government. The transition is notable because it is the first time since the 1959 Cuban revolution that a majority of the government is not in charge. It is also the firsttime that Cuba's head of government is a member of the Communist Party (PCC), which is the leading force in state and society. The National Assembly also selected 72-year-old Salvador Valdés Mesa as first vice president, not from the younger generation of the PCC, to serve until 2021, when his term as party leader ends. In February 2019, almost 87% of Cubans approved a new constitution in a national referendum. Although the new constitution locks in some market-oriented economic reforms that have been introduced in recent years (private property, private sector, and foreign investment), it also ensures the state sector's dominance over the economy and the predominate role of the communist party in Cuba's political system. The human rights situation in Cuba remains poor, with the government sharply restricting freedoms of expression, association, assembly, movement, and other basic rights. The government has continued to harass members of human rights and other dissident organizations.
Rwanda has achieved a rare degree of political stability, public safety, and economic growth in a sub-region plagued by armed conflicts and humanitarian crises. Government programs to improve health, agricultural output, private investment, and gender equality have received international plaudits and donor support. Rwanda's development and security gains are particularly remarkable in the wake of the 1994 genocide, in which extremist members of the ethnic Hutu majority orchestrated a three-month killing spree targeting the minority Tutsi community, along with the tiny indigenous Twa ethnic group and Hutus who opposed the massacres. The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) seized power in mid-1994, stopping the genocide. Since then, President Paul Kagame has been widely viewed as the architect of Rwanda's "miracle" and of its autocratic political model. He has repeatedly won reelection by wide margins, most recently in 2017. The United States and Rwanda have cultivated close ties since the mid-1990s, underpinned by U.S. aid and participation in international peacekeeping and humanitarian operations in Africa. In recent years, however, some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about Rwanda's human rights record and its role in regional conflicts, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, and Uganda, and have sought to restrict or suspend certain types of aid to Rwanda if it is found to be supporting rebel groups in those countries. The Trump Administration has continued to support bilateral economic ties, but has also advocated cuts to funding for Rwanda, including health and development aid. In 2018, President Trump suspended Rwanda's trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA, reauthorized via P.L. 114-27) in response to Rwanda's allegedly protectionist policies, in the context of the Administration's skepticism toward nonreciprocal trade preference programs. The impact may be largely symbolic: in 2017, U. S. imports from Rwanda totaled $44 million, of which $5 million were under AGOA, and U.N. peacekeeping operations totaled $1.2 billion. Rwanda remains one of the world's poorest countries, although it ranks higher than many other sub-Saharan African countries on the 2018 U. N. Human Development Index (at 158 out of 189 countries assessed). About 75% of Rwandans are engaged in agriculture, many for subsistence; the country is nonetheless reliant on food imports, in part due to having the highest population density in continental Africa. The government seeks to transform the economy into one that is services-oriented and middle-income, launching programs to expand internet access, improve education, and increase domestic energy production. Key growth sectors include tourism, coffee, tea, tin mining, construction, and an emerging financial services sector. Much investment has been concentrated in Kigali, which has received international praise for its clean and safe streets. Rwanda was ranked 29 out of 190 on the World Bank's 2019 Doing Business report, the only low-income country and one of only two African countries (along with Mauritius) in the top 50.
Prior to the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, insurers generally did not exclude or separately charge for coverage of terrorism risk. The events of September 11, 2001, changed this as insurers realized the extent of possible terrorism losses. Because of the lack of public data on, or modeling of, the scope and nature of the terrorism risk, reinsurers felt unable to accurately price for such risks and largely withdrew from the market for terrorism risk insurance in the months following 9/11. Once reinsurers stopped offering coverage for such risk, primary insurers, suffering equally from a lack of data and models, also withdrew, or tried to withdraw, from the insurance market. In most states, state regulators must approve policy form changes. Most state regulators agreed to insurer requests to exclude terrorism risks from commercial policies, just as these policies had long excluded war risks. In 2002, Congress responded to the fears of economic damage due to the absence of commercially available coverage for terrorism with passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). TRIA created a three-year Terrorism Insurance Program to provide a government reinsurance backstop in the case of terrorist attacks. The program was amended and extended in 2005, 2007, and 2015. Following the 2015 amendments, the TRIA program is set to expire at the end of 2020. Although Congress has amended specific aspects of the original TRIA statute, the operation of the program generally usually follows the original statute. The changes to the program have largely reduced the government coverage for terrorist losses, except that the 2007 amendments expanded coverage to domestic terrorism losses, rather than limiting the program to foreign terrorism. The current Administration has not called for specific changes to TRIA, but has indicated that it is "evaluating reforms…to further decrease taxpayer exposure." The insurance industry largely continues to support TRIA as do commercial insurance consumers in the real estate and other industries that have formed a "Coalition to Insure Against Terrorism" (CIAT). However, not all insurance consumers have consistently supported the renewal of TRIA. For example, the Consumer Federation of America has questioned the need for the program in the past. The Department of the Treasury has reported that the take-up rate for terrorism insurance in 2017 was 62%. The price of terrorism insurance has appeared to decline over time, although the level of pricing reported may not always be comparable between sources. The 2013 report by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, based on survey data by insurance broker Aon, showed a high of above 7% for the median terrorism premium as a percentage of the total property premium in 2003, with a generally downward trend, and more recent values around 3%. The trend may be downward, but there has been variability, particularly across industries, particularly in 2009 and 2010. The Treasury reports based on industry data calls have found similar or higher take- up rates. For 2017, Treasury found that theTake-up rates based on premium volumes was 62%, whereas based on policy counts, the rate was 78%.
This report provides an overview of the federal homeland security enterprise, focusing on the role of the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) within the federal government. It also provides a brief overview of issues that may be of interest to Congress during the 116th Congress. The report begins with a discussion of the statutory authority for executive branch official security. The USSS and the State Department are the only two agencies that have specific statutory authority to protect executive branch officials. The Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service special agents are authorized to protect specific individuals under 22 U. S.C. §2709(a)(3). In 2000, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that other agencies providing protective security details to executive branch Officials cited various other legal authorities. These authorities included the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 C.R. App. 3), a specific delegation of authority set forth in 7 C.F.R., App. 33(a), and a 1970 memorandum from the White House Counsel to Cabinet departments. The Trump Administration has proposed consolidating protective details at certain civilian executive branch agencies under the United States Marshals Service ( USMS) to more efficiently monitor and respond to potential threats. This proposal was made in an attempt to standardize executive branchofficial protection in agencies that currently have USMS security details or have their employees deputized by the USMS. The proposal would not affect any law or military agencies with explicit statutory authority, such as the USSS or the State department. The United States sustains a multi-billion dollar illegal drug market. An estimated 28.6 million Americans, or 10.6% of the population age 12 or older, had used illicit drugs at least once in the past month in 2016. Current domestic drug threats, fueled in part by Mexican traffickers, include opioids such as heroin, fentanyl, and diverted or counterfeit controlled prescription drugs; marijuana; methamphetamine; cocaine; and synthetic psychoactive drugs. While marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit drug, the most recent data show an elevated level of heroin use, including elevated overdose deaths linked to heroin and other opioids, and there has been a simultaneous increase in its availability, fueled by a number of factors including increased production and trafficking of heroin by Mexican criminal networks. Increases in Mexican heroin production and its availability have been coupled with increased heroin seizures at the Southwest border. According to the DEA, the amount of heroin seized nationwide, including at the southwest border, has generally increased over the past decade; nationwide heroin seizures reached 7979 kg in 2017, up from about 2,000 kg seized at the southwestern border a decade earlier. In addition to heroin, officials have become increasingly concerned with the trafficking of fentanyl, particularly nonpharmaceutical, illicit fentanyl. Fentanyl can be mixed with heroin and/or other drugs sometimes without the consumer's knowledge, and has been involved in an increasing number of opioid overdoses. It is manufactured in China and Mexico and is trafficked into the United United States across the border or delivered directly from China, or delivered through couriers directly from Mexico. It has been linked to an increased number of fentanyl-related incidents in recent years, including the 2018 attempted bombing attacks on current and former government officials (and others) in October 2018. Congress has historically legislated and conducted oversight on USSS protection of persons and facilities because of USSS' public mission of protecting the President and his family, and its mission of investigating financial crimes. Most recently, the 115th Congress held oversight hearings on challenges facing the Service and held hearings on legislation that addressed costs associated with USSS protective detail operations and special agents' pay. These two issues remain pertinent in the116th Congress due to recent, but failed, attacks on US SS protectees, and the media's and public's attention on the cost of protecting President Donald Trump and the Trump family. This report will be updated as events warrant.
In January 2019, the House agreed to H.Res. 6, a resolution "Adopting the Rules of the House of Representatives for the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress." This report summarizes amendments to House rules affecting committee procedure in the 116th Congress (2019-2020) as provided for in H. Res. 6. Separate orders contained in the resolution that relate to committee procedure, including the establishment of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and the Select committee on the Modernization of Congress, have the same force and effect as House rules and are commonly included in the House rules package resolution. Rules changes that affect all House committees concern committee membership and organization, hearings and markups, and committee oversight and investigations. Changes that affect specific committees include modifications to the names, jurisdiction, or procedure of certain House committees. In the 116 th Congress, H.R. 6 re-designated the Committee on Education and the Workforce, changing the committee's name to the Committee of Education and Labor, changed its jurisdiction to include the "organization, administration, and general management" of the Department of Education, and changed its authority to include oversight of the Executive Office of the President. It also amended the rules to allow the House Committee on Ethics to form an investigative subcommittee in cases where a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner is indicted on a criminal charge. The House Rules Committee was given the authority to file its committee reports without the inclusion of record votes taken in the committee. In addition to these changes, the rules package also included a separate order that authorized the chairs of all standing House committees, except for the Rules Committee, and the chair of the select committee, to order the "taking of depositions, including pursuant to subpoena, by a member or counsel of such committee." In the 115th Congress, House rules required committees to submit authorization and oversight plans. The resolution removed the role of the Appropriations Committee in the review of such plans. This report will be updated as warranted by events. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33498, House Rules Changes in the 115 th Congress: H.Rept. 115-343, by [author name scrubbed].

The Navy's proposed FY2019 budget requests a total of $2,347 million (i.e., about $2.3 billion) in procurement funding for the Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier program. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission also proposed to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (called a Refueling Complex Overhaul, or RCOH) for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 ( Harry S. Truman), and to instead retire the ship around FY2024 and also deactivate one of the Navy's carrier air wings at about the same time. On April 30, 2019, however, the Administration announced that it was effectively withdrawing this proposal from the FY2020 Navy's budget submission. The Administration now supports funding the RCOh and keeping CVN75 (and by implication its associated air wing) in service past FY202024. For additional discussion of this withdrawn budget proposal, see Appendix A. In December 2016, the Navy released a force-level goal for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships, including 12 aircraft carriers—one more than the minimum of 11 carriers required by 10 U.S.C. 8062(b). This was the first Navy force- level goal to call for 12 (rather than 11) carriers since 2002-2004. Given the time needed to build a carrier and the projected retirement dates of existing carriers, increasing the carrier force from 11 ships to 12 ships on a sustained basis would take a number of years: Procuring carriers on 3-year centers—that is, procuring one carrier every three years—would achieve a 12-carrier force on a sustainment basis by about 2030, unless the service lives of one or more existing carriers were substantially extended. Procuring carrier aircraft on 3.5-year or 4-year center ships would achieve a sustained 12-Carrier force no earlier than about 2060s, and on 4- year centers by about 2063—almost 30 years later. The projected size of the force would be achieved in the Navys FY2020-FY2049 shipbuilding plan reflected in the proposal to fund the CVN82 in FY2028, and a12-carriers force in the FY2060s. For the past several years, cost growth and Navy efforts to manage costs so as to stay within program cost caps have been continuing oversight issues for Congress on the CVn-78 program. Since the submission of the FY2008 budget, the estimated procurement costs of CVN 78, CVN 79, and CVN 80 have grown 24.7%, 23.2%, and 15.1%, respectively. Cost growth on CVN78 required the Navy to program $1,394.9 million in cost-to-complete procurement funds for the ship in FY2014-FY2016 and FY2018. As also shown in the table below, while the estimated cost of CVn 78 grew considerably between FY2008 and the FY2014 budget (the budget in which it was procured), it has declined by only a small amount (less than 1%) since the FY2013 budget. The estimated cost for CVN79 grew considerably from FY2008 to FY2013 (in part because the procurement date was deferred by one year in FY2010) and from FY2013 to FY2014, and since FY2014 it has decreased by about 11%. The estimated costs for CVn 80 grew from $1.8 billion in FY2013 and FY2014 to $3.2 billion in 2015 and FY2016, and from $4.1 billion in 2016 and FY2017. In the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act (S. 1356/P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015), Congress limited the availability of funds for procurement for the U.s. John F. Kennedy (CVn-79) and CVn–80 to no more than $100,000,000 until the Navy submits to Congress a report evaluating cost issues related to CVN–79 andCVN–80. In August 2018, Congress authorized a two-ship block buy contract for the two aircraft carriers, and the Navy awarded the contract on January 31, 2019. The two ships are being procured in different years (CVNs 80 and 81). The Navy plans to award the CVNs 80 construction contract in early FY 2019 as a block buy pending congressional approval and achieving significant savings. Congress's decisions on
The conditions of terms and tenure for the President and Vice President of the United States have evolved over nearly two centuries, from the earliest provisions in Article II, Section 1, of the U.S. Constitution, set by the Constitutional Convention in 1787, to provisions governing vacancies in the office of Vice President established in the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967. Both the four-year term and the venerable two-term tradition, initiated by George Washington and ultimately incorporated in the Constitution in 1951, appear to be fixed elements in the nation's political landscape. Since that time, a wide range of changes to these conditions has been proposed as constitutional amendments, but relatively few conditions have been added to the original provisions governing the President's term of office. Proposals to change the length of the presidential term, or to limit the number of terms to which a President could be elected, were introduced in Congress beginning in the early 19th century. The first category included constitutional amendments for a six-year, five-, seven-, or eight-yearterm of office, usually coupled with limitation to a single term in office. By the 20th century, a single six- year term had become the preferred alternative for such amendments, with multiple amendment proposals introduced in successive Congresses as late as the 1990s. In the past two decades, however, public and congressional interest in these issues has arguably declined. Nevertheless, the potential for renewed interest in change, which has emerged as a force to be contended with in the past, remains a possibility in both the present and future. The Constitution, in its original text and four subsequent amendments, provides the basic conditions of presidential and vice presidential terms, tenure, and eligibility for reelection. This report provides a brief overview of current provisions and options for change. It will be updated periodically to reflect legislative activity and historical developments. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33487, Presidential Tenure and Term Limits, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10101, Presidential Term Limits: A Brief Overview of Current Provisions and Options for Change, both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, CRS-17-921, by[author name also scrubbed].

This report addresses frequently asked questions related to the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for executive, administrative, and professional employees (the "EAP" or "white collar" exemptions). The FLSA, enacted in 1938, is the main federal law that establishes minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for most, but not all, private and public sector employees. Section 7(a) of the FLSA specifies that unless an employee is specifically exempted in the act, he or she is considered to be a covered "nonexempt" employee and must receive pay at the rate of one-and-a-half times ("time and a half") the employee's regular rate for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek. Section 13(a)(1) provided an exemption, from both the minimum wage (Section 6) and overtime (Section 7) provisions of the act for "any employee employed in a bona fide executive, Administrative, and Professional capacity." The Secretary of Labor is authorized to define and delimit these terms "from time to time" by regulations. To qualify for the EAP exemption, an employee must be paid on a "salary basis," rather than on a per hour basis. That is, an EAP employee must receive a predetermined and fixed payment that is not subject to reduction due to variations in the quantity or quality of work. The salary must bepaid on a weekly or less-frequent basis. Job titles alone do not determine exemption status for an employee. Rather, the Secretary, through issuance of regulations, specifies the duties that EAP employees must perform in order to be exempt from the overtime requirements of the law. In addition to the salary level, a "highly compensated employee" (HCE) is also exempt from overtime requirements if they perform at least one (among many) of EAP duties. The EAP exemptions apply to all employees in the U.S. territories, including American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The exemption for American Samoa has traditionally been set at 84% of the standard salary level while the other territories have been subject to the standard level. In the absence of action by the Board of Directors of the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (the Board, headed by a five-member board of directors) and by Congress, the provisions in any future final rules would not change the status quo. This report will be updated as events warrant.
For more than four decades, Congress has authorized and refined several programs to help communities address water supply and wastewater problems. The agencies that administer these programs differ in multiple ways. For example, in terms of funding mechanisms, projects developed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) typically require direct, individual project authorizations from Congress. In contrast, standing program authorizations provide project funding for other agencies, including the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The key practical difference is that with the individual authorizations there is no predictable assistance, or even guarantee of funding after a project is authorized, because funding must be secured each year in the congressional appropriations process. The programs, on the other hand, have set program criteria, are generally funded from year to year, and provide a process under which project sponsors compete for funding. Federal funding for the programs and projects discussed in this report varies greatly. Collectively, congressional funding for these programs in recent years has been somewhat eroded by overall competition among the many programs that are supported by discretionary spending, despite the continuing pressure from stakeholders and others for increased funding. While federal support for some traditional financing tools—project grants, formula grants, capitalization grants, direct and guaranteed loans—has declined, policymakers have begun to consider alternative financing approaches, such as trust funds, new types of federal loans, and options to encourage private sector investments in water infrastructure through public-private partnerships. Supporters of some of these newer ideas (e.g., the "Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program) see them as options to supplement or complement, but not replace, traditional financing Tools. This report focuses on municipal and industrial (M&I) water and wastewater activities. It does not address projects and programs that involve irrigation, flood control, power supply, and recreation. However, in some cases (noted below), a federal program may primarily support one or more of these other objectives while providing some support for M&I activities, even if only incidentally. Other federal authorities of USDA's Rural Utilities Service, Reclamation, and USACE may be available to assist with the provision of emergency water and Wastewater needs, including improving access to water supplies during a drought. These authorities are not discussed in the report. The Department of the Interior's (DOI's) Bureau of the Reclamation has a current inventory of 4,000 "constructed real property assets worth nearly $100 billion. Overall, these facilities serve approximately 31 million people, delivering a total of approximately 28.5 million-feet of water (an acre-foot is enough to cover one foot of land, or 325,851 gallons annually) in nondrought years. Reclamation owns and manages 475 dams and reservoirs, which are capable of storing 245 million-foot of water. In 2017, the state and local share of such projects (both capital and maintenance spending) was 96%, while the federal share was 4%. The federal share of the cost of these projects is generally limited to a maximum of 25% of total project costs and is nonreimbursable, resulting in a partial de facto grant to the local project sponsor or sponsor(s). For FY2019, the President's budget requested $1.109 billion for Reclamation's programs and activities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, P.L. 116-6, appropriated $1 billion for FY2019.
The House of Representatives has standing rules that govern how bills and resolutions are to be taken up and considered on the floor. However, to expedite legislation receiving floor action, the House may temporarily set aside these rules for measures that are not otherwise privileged for consideration. This can be done by agreeing to a special order of business resolution (special rule) or by adopting a motion to suspend the rules and pass the underlying measure. In general, special rules enable the consideration of complex or contentious legislation, such as major appropriations or reauthorizations, while the suspension of the rules procedure is usually applied to broadly supported legislation that can be approved without floor amendments or extensive debate in the chamber. The suspension procedure allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. Motions to suspension the rules require a two-thirds vote, so the procedure is typically reserved for bills that can meet a supermajority threshold. This report describes the suspension procedure, which is defined in clause 1 of House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under suspension during the 114th Congress (2015-2016). This report will be updated as warranted by legislative activity. For more information, see CRS Report RL33476, Suspension of the Rules in the House: Analysis of Legislation considered under Suspension, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10240, Suspention of the House Rules: Analysis and Analysis of Measures considered under the Suspension Procedure in the 114 th Congress (2007-2016), by [ author name scrubbing]. This report also includes a table that summarizes the final legislative status of measures initially considered in the Senate and House under suspension. The report will not be updated to reflect action on suspension measures in the 115 th Congress or any further action on such measures during the 113 th Congress.

The growth of the national debt, which is considered unsustainable under current policies, continues to be one of the central issues of domestic federal policymaking. The federal government incurs a budget deficit when total spending exceeds revenues over the course of a fiscal year. Over the past 50 years, the federal government has, on average, run budget deficits of 2.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), though the amount has fluctuated from a surplus of two.3% in 2000 to a deficit of 9.8% of GDP in 2009. A portion of the budget outcomes is a function of general economic conditions, and the remainder is a result of policy choices. For example, deficits tend to rise during recessions (through a combination of decreased revenues and increased spending on programs like unemployment), whereas the opposite is generally true during economic expansions. Policy choices, such as the decline in defense spending after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, may change the budget situation due to changes in national priorities. The accumulation of net deficits over time results in the federal debt. As shown in the table below, the cumulative federal debt in 2018 was 78% of the economy's GDP. The FY2018 deficit is 4% of economy-wide GDP—a situation viewed by most economists as unsustainable. This report examines alternative approaches to reducing annual budget deficits and decisions about how to bring the national Debt under control over the long term. To do this, the report first examines historical trends in federal spending and revenue policy to illustrate both the challenges and trade-offs inherent to making choices between (1) limiting the provision of defense and domestic public goods, (2) reducing transfers to persons including entitlements for the elderly and those with low income, (3) reducing support for state and local governments, and (4) raising taxes. The report then addresses how limiting reliance on one source of deficit reduction creates pressure on other sources. It concludes with a discussion of how different approaches to and constraints imposed on deficit reduction will have consequences for the menus of other available choices. If deficit reduction begins with a constraint that taxes will not rise, policy would almost certainly require significant cutbacks in Social Security and Medicare. If the benefits of these programs are to be maintained, an increase in taxes would likely be required. In contrast, if the burden of restoring solvency on the Social Security trust fund is to be shifted to the elderly, the burden would fall more heavily on lower-income individuals. The next section of this report examines the government's spending allocation, the method of its financing, and how these shares and sources have changed over time. It demonstrates that the surge in the debt is a recent phenomenon that has occurred with the recession and is inherently transitory. Going forward, however, the growth in transfers to elderly and spending for health care—a trend that has been under way for some time but was offset by a decline in spending for other purposes, relative to GDP—will increasingly contribute to unsustainable deficits.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent federal agency, with its five members appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. It was established by the Communications Act of 1934 (1934 Act, or "Communications Act") and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The mission of the FCC is to ensure that the American people have available, "without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges." The FCC is authorized to review the regulatory fees each year and adjust them to reflect changes in its appropriation from year to year. The Commission originally implemented the Regulatory Fee Collection Program by rulemaking on July 18, 1994. The most recent regulatory fee order was released by the Commission on August 29, 2018. On March 23, 2018, the Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Services Act of 2018 (the "RAY BAUM'S Act" or "2018 Act") became law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). The 2018 Act requires the FCC to transfer all excess collections for FY2018 and prior years to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury for the sole purpose of deficit reduction. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. This is $3,950,000 less than the authorization level of $339,610,000 included in the 2018 FCC Reauthorization. The FY2020 FCC request also represents a decrease of $3.340,000, or about 1.0%, from the FY2019 appropriated level of approximately $339.0 million. The FCC has also requested $132,538,680 for the spectrum auctions program, which included additional funds to implement the requirements of the 2018 Act that mandated significant additional work for the FCC related to the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund. The Consolidated appropriations act, 2018 also reauthorized the FCC for the first time since 1990 (the FCC Authorization Act of 1990, P.L., 101-396). The FCC's 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom Order (2017 Order) overturned the 2015 Open Internet Order (2015 Order) promulgated under the leadership of former Chairman Tom Wheeler, and the 2017 Order overturning those rules, promulgated by Chairman Pai, can be used to illustrate the contrast between the regulatory philosophies of the two chairmen: Some policymakers contend that more proscriptive regulations, such as those contained in the 2015 Order, are necessary to protect the marketplace from potential abuses which could threaten the net neutrality concept. On the other hand, Chairman Pai speaks about protecting and benefitting the public through the promotion of market incentives and efficiency. In the 115th Congress, the House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government held a hearing on the FCC's FY2020 budget on April 3, 2019. The hearing addressed issues including 5G deployment, federal preemption of state and local tower siting requirements, merger reviews, robocalls, and net neutrality. No bills that would affect the operation of the Commission have been introduced in the 116th Congress.
Cluster munitions are weapons that open in mid-air and disperse smaller submunitions—anywhere from a few dozen to hundreds—into an area. They can be delivered by aircraft or from ground systems such as artillery, rockets, and missiles. Cluster munitions are valued militarily because one munition can kill or destroy many targets within its impact area, and fewer weapons systems are needed to deliver fewer munitions to attack multiple targets. Many cluster munitions rely on simple mechanical fuzes that arm the submunition based on its rate of spin and explode on impact or after a time delay. Cluster bombs were first used in World War II, and inclusive of their debut, cluster munitions have been used in at least 21 states by at least 13 different countries. The U.S. military has used cluster munitions extensively in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, and the Balkans. In Kosovo and Yugoslavia in 1999, NATO forces dropped 1,765 cluster bombs containing approximately 295,000 submunition. From 2001 through 2002, the United States dropped more than 1,228 cluster bombs in Afghanistan containing 248,056 sub Munition in 2002, and almost 13,000 cluster munitions containing an estimated 1.8 million to 2 million Submunitions during the first three weeks of combat in Iraq in 2003. In 2006, Israeli use of cluster munitions against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon resulted in widespread international criticism. In 2008, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117), which the President signed into law December 16, 2009, prohibiting the provision of military assistance for cluster munitions, the issuing of defense export licenses for Cluster Munitions, or the sale or transfer of Cluster Munition or cluster munitions technology unless "the sub Munitions of the cluster munitions (after arming) do not result in more than one percent unexploded ordnance across the range of intended operational environments." Subsequent appropriations laws have included similar provisions; the most recent is the Consolidation Appropriations Act of 2019 (P,L. 116-6), which was signed into Law on February 15, 2019. In November 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) revised its policy on cluster munitions. The new policy requires that cluster munitions used after 2018 must leave less than 1% of unexploded submunctions on the battlefield, but it does not establish a deadline to replace cluster munitions exceeding the 1% rate, and these munitions will be removed only after new munitions that meet the standard are fielded in sufficient quantities to meet combatant commander requirements. However, the new DOD policy stipulates that the department will only procure cluster munitions "that meet the standards prescribed by this policy for procuring new cluster munitions" and that "the department will not transfer cluster munitions except as provided for under U. S. law." This policy reversal raises a number of issues for possible congressional consideration, including the following: How does this change in policy affect combatant commanders' operational plans in their respective theaters? Does this mean a lesser degree of military risk because commanders can employ cluster munitions to meet warfighting demands, possibly translating into fewer forces needed to achieve the same result when the 2008 policy was in effect? Will DOD funding restrictions slow or stall programs previously intended to replace systems that exceeded 1% because there no longer is an urgent operational need to replace those systems? In a similar manner, will defense industry view this as a renewed opportunity to develop systems with a 1% or less unexplodedSubmunitions standard or take a more sanguine view that since DOD is no longer time constrained to develop and field 1% and less weapons that funding these programs will be less of a priority and, therefore, an unprofitable venture? Another possible issue for consideration is how this policy reversal will be perceived by the international community and how this might affect future military treaty initiatives. This report will be updated as events warrant.
U.S. foreign intelligence relations are a component of U.S., international relations that involve cooperation between the United States and a foreign state or non-state intelligence service over an area of mutual interest. This cooperation may include simple liaison to discuss or exchange information, raw data, or finished intelligence. Intelligence liaison leverages the relative strengths of the interested intelligence services to provide tactical, operational, or strategic insight and perspective to provide warning of attack, corroboration of national sources, or additional, possibly unique, intelligence that the other service lacks. Other forms of cooperation include basing rights, joint operations, and training to improve the capacity and professionalism of a foreign intelligence service. In areas of the world where the Intelligence Community (IC) has few national intelligence assets, cooperative relations with foreign intelligence services based in the region can effectively increase the range of intelligence coverage by using the partner's source network and linguistic, political, and cultural expertise. In many—but not all—instances, intelligence relations with a foreign partner may be viewed as an approximate reflection of the strategic condition of the relationship between the U. S. and that partner generally. They indicate shared interests and a degree of trust in the professional ability of the partner to provide credible intelligence while protecting sources and maintaining security about the nature and extent of the Relationship. Although the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) provides the policy and criteria, and conducts oversight for all IC element intelligence relationships with foreignintelligence services, the IC elements themselves have the statutory authority to enter into agreements with foreign counterparts. Normally every relationship is formalized through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or other written agreement. This report provides a historic perspective of both traditional and nontraditional foreign intelligence partnerships with the U.,S. It also discusses their risks and benefits in the context of the broader public discussion over the sorts of relationships the United United States should have with various actors in the international community. The United States has cultivated intelligence liaison relations with many foreign partners through (1) the exchange of information and raw data; (2) base rights for conducting intelligence operations, or privileges to host technical intelligence equipment; (3) burden sharing in the collection and reporting on issues of mutual interests; (4) joint covert action, collection, or exploitation operations; and (5) training. The relationship with the United Kingdom is among the oldest and the best known. The IC also has multilateral relationships, with NATO member states, Five Eyes partners (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), and the intelligence organizations supporting coalition partners in operational theaters such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The CIA has solidified many of these partnerships through the establishment of a network of Counterterrorist Intelligence Centers (CTICs) around the world to facilitate sharing intelligence on terrorism, such as indications and warning of an attack, with a host-nation government to effect the killing or capture of high-value targets. The Counterterrorist Center (CTC) at CIA headquarters manages the CTICs overseas. The National Security Agency (NSA) is also represented in the CTics, underscoring the importance of signals intelligence (and the corresponding foreign partnerships) to counterterrorist operations.
The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) requires that states follow certain voter registration requirements for federal elections. NVRA does not set requirements for state or local elections. The stated purposes of NVRA are to establish procedures to increase the number of eligible citizens registered to vote in federal elections; enable enhanced voter participation in federal election elections; protect the integrity of the electoral process; and ensure accurate voter registration records. In addition to voter registration methods, NVRA included procedural requirements for states to follow when performing voter registration list maintenance or when adding, removing, or modifying records for registered voters. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) was required to provide guidance to the states for implementing NVRA and to publish a biennial election report assessing the impact of the act on federal election administration and offering recommendations for improvements to federal and state procedures, forms, and other matters affected by NVRA. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 (P.L. 109-295, 114th Congress) was enacted in 2002 and serves as another key piece of federal election policy, addressing a number of election administration elements in light of issues revealed during the 2000 presidential election. This report focuses only on the parts of HAVA that affected NVRA or voter registration in federal Elections, namely, the computerization of state voter lists; changes to the federal mail-based voter registration form; and transferring the FEC's role to a newly created Election Assistance Commission (EAC). More comprehensive information can be found in CRS Report RS20898, The HelpAmerica Vote Act and Election Administration: Overview and Selected Issues for the 2016 Election, by [author name scrubbed]. NVRA, as amended, provides much of the framework for federal voter registration policy. For example, the act requires states to establish voter registration procedures for eligible individuals to register to vote, or to update their registration records, simultaneously with their applications for motor vehicle driver's licenses or for any other form of personal identification provided by the state's department of motor vehicles (DMVs). In addition, states must also establish other in-person voter registration locations, including at federal, state, or nongovernmental offices that primarily provide public assistance or services to persons with disabilities, and at other locations as described in Section 7 of the motor-voter bill. The act also contains criteria for states' voter registration forms and requires states' to accept a national mail- based registration form created by the FEC. In the 115th Congress, legislation was introduced on a variety of voter registration-related measures, including legislation to expand the ways in which individuals can register tovote, as well as legislation to update the technologies states use to share and store voter registration data. Some of these bills were narrowly tailored to address a particular part of voter Registration, whereas other bills proposed broader policies affecting a numberof components of election Administration, including voter registration. The Appendix provides a full list of related bills introduced in the 115 th Congress.
For much of the past century, U.S. national security strategy focused on several core, interrelated objectives. These include enhancing U.N. security at home and abroad; promoting U. S. economic prosperity; and promoting free markets and democracy around the world. The United States has used both unilateral and multilateral mechanisms to achieve these objectives, with varying amounts of emphasis at different times. These mechanisms have included a range of military, diplomatic, and economic tools. Arms control and nonproliferation efforts are two of the tools that have occasionally been used to implement these objectives. They generally are not pursued as ends in and of themselves, and many argue that they should not become more important than the strategy behind them. But many believe their effective employment can be critical to the success of that broader strategy. Many analysts see them as a complement to, rather than a substitute for, military or economic efforts. Effective arms control measures are thought to enhance U. s national security in a number of ways. For example, they include monitoring mechanisms that can provide early warning of efforts to evade or ignore the obligations. They also promote transparency in a way that might increase knowledge about and understanding of the size, makeup, and operations of an opposing military force. Transparency measures can also build confidence among wary adversaries. They can also be designed to complement U.s. force structure objectives by limiting or restraining other nations' forces. During times of declining defense budget resources, such measures may also help ensure reciprocity in force reductions. Indeed, some analysts consider such measures essential to the successful implementation of our national military objectives. During the Cold War, arms control played a key role in the relationship between the United States and the former Soviet Union. Although the agreements rarely forced either side to accept significant changes in its nuclear forces, the arms control process, and the formal negotiations, were often one of the few channels for communication between theUnited States and Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Further, during the George W. Bush Administration, many in his Administration questioned the degree to which President Bush and his Administration extended assistance to Russia and other former Soviet states in an effort to reduce the threat that weapons of mass destruction might fall into the hands of hostile states or nonstate actors. It has explored the possible use of similar tools to provide other nations with assistance in containing and controlling weapons and weapons-grade materials. The Trump Administration has offered some support for existing arms control tools; it noted, in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, that it would continue to abide by the terms of the 2010 New START Treaty, although it had not decided whether to extend it past 2021. At the same time, the Administration has noted that it might be better served by bolstering its military capabilities than by negotiating additional limits or reductions. This report provides an overview of many of the key arms control agreements and endeavors of the last 40 years. It is divided into three sections. The first describes arms control efforts between the states of the Former Soviet Union, covering both formal, bilateral treaties and the cooperative threat reduction process. The second section describes multilateral nuclear nonproLiferation efforts, including both formal treaties and less formal accommodations that have been initiated in recent years. The final section reviews treaties and agreements that address chemical, biological, and conventional weapons. The report concludes with several appendices. These provide a list of treaties and treaties that the United states is a party to, a description of the treaty ratification process, a lists of international organizations tasked with implementing arms control treaties, and a list and list of arms control control efforts.
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with the People's Republic of China (China) remains a major source of bilateral tension. In March 2018, the Trump Administration reportedly asked China to develop a plan to reduce the bilateral trade deficit by $100 billion. On March 31, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13786, which states: Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative (USTR), in consultation with the Secretaries of State, the Treasury, Defense, Agriculture, and Homeland Security, and the heads of any other executive departments or agencies with relevant expertise, as determined by the Secretary and the USTR, shall prepare and submit to the President an Omnibus Report on Significant Trade Deficits (Report). President Trump also issued Executive order 13796, "Addressing Trade Agreement Violations and Abuses," on April 29, 2017. President Trump's executive order requires the Department of Commerce's and USTR's to "conduct comprehensive performance reviews" of "all trade relations with countries governed by the rules of the World Trade Organization with which theUnited States does not have free trade agreements but with which it runs significant trade deficits in goods." China is one such country. The United States and China have been engaged in a long-running debate over the size of the bilateral merchandise trade imbalance. According to official United States trade statistics, the bilateral deficit with China increased from about $83 billion in 2001 to more than $419 billion in 2018. However, according to official Chinese figures, China's bilateral trade surplus with the UnitedStates increased more than 11-fold, from $28 billion to $323 billion, from 2001 to 2018. China's figures for its exports to the United states differed from U. S. figures by $48.3 billion in2001 and $61.1 billion in2018. China has not accepted the "accuracy" of the official U.s. figure for the Sino-U.S." trade balance for at least two decades. The discrepancy between the two countries' official trade statistics is due to differences in the value of goods shipped directly between the countries, as well as differences in how the goods are categorized. The value of the goods may change between the date a shipment leaves China and the date when it arrives in the United Kingdom, for example, due to changes in the exchange rate between China's currency, the renminbi (RMB), or changes in ownership of the ship. In addition, the value may change due to mid-shipment transfers in ownership resulting in the new owner adding a markup in the price to the shipment, or it may be the result of intentional under-invoicing of exports. Some analysts believe that Chinese importers may intentionally under-value imports to lower the import tariff due on the shipment to maximize their net proceeds overseas for various tax and regulatory reasons. More recently, bilateral trade figures may have been distorted by "phantom goods" shipments from China tothe United States (and other locations) used to disguise attempts to move financial capital offshore. In April 2004, the 15th Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) established a statistical working group, with representatives of China's Ministry of Commerce, General Administration of Customs, and Office of the U.N. Trade Representative, to examine the "unusually large and growing statistical discrepancies in the bilateral goods trade data officially published by [the] two countries." The Working Group subsequently decided to conduct a reconciliation study to determine the causes of the discrepancies. The first report was released in October 2009; the second in December 2012. The main conclusions of the two studies are largely the same. The greatest discrepancy is in the "eastbound trade" data, which accounts for 80%-90% of the overall difference in annual trade balance. Roughly half of the " eastbound trade data discrepancy can be attributed to goods that "leave China, enter the commerce of intermediate countries or regions, and then [are] re-exported to theUnitedStates."
This report addresses a core issue facing the 116th Congress: What, if any, additional action should the federal government take to enhance small business access to capital? It discusses the role of small business in job creation and retention, provides an assessment of the supply and demand for small business loans, and discusses recently enacted laws designed to enhanceSmall Business Administration (SBA) programs designed to increase the supply of loans to small businesses. It also examines recent actions concerning the SBA's budget and concludes with a brief overview of three legislative options available to address small businessaccess to capital issues during the 116 th Congress: wait-and-see, enact additional programs, or reduce and consolidate existing programs. During the 111th Congress, the House passed the Small Business Financing and Investment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-240), which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) to make capital investments in eligible community banks ($4 billion was issued) and a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs. The Senate passed its version of the SBLF in 2010 (S.Rept. 112-81). The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 provided $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses and increased the maximum loan guaranty percentage for the 7(a) program from 85% to 90% for loans exceeding $150,000 or less and from 75% to 85% for all regular 7(A) loans. The SBA also provided $505 million (plus an additional $5 million for administrative expenses) to continue the fee subsidies and the 90% maximum loan guarantee percentage through December 31, 2010. The Small business Jobs Act also provided funding to extend SBA fee subsidies through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted, which occurred on January 3, 2011. The President signed into law P. l. 111–322, the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act of 2011, on January 4, 2012, which extended SBA fees subsidies and loan guarantees through March 5, 2012. The act also authorized $15 million in additional funding for the SSA's 7( a) loan guarantY program, increased the loan guarantee limits for the program from $2 million to $5.5 million, and for the 504/CDC program from    $1 million for "regular" borrowers, from $4 million to   million if the loan proceeds are directed toward one or more specified public policy goals, and from $3.5 to $4 billion for manufacturers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, increased SBA funding for its Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) venture capital program, which provides privately owned and managed SBA-licensed SBICs with loans at favorable rates (called leverage), and, in exchange, the SB ICs provide equity capital to small business concerns in various ways, including by purchasing small business equity securities (e.g., stock, stock options, warrants), making loans tosmall businesses, purchasing debt securities from small businesses, and providing small businesses a guarantee of their monetary obligations to creditors not associated with the SBIC. P.l. 114-38, the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, authorized and made permanent the Obama Administration's waiver of the up-front, one-time loan guarantee fee for veteran loans under the SBIC's SBAExpress program, and the act also increased the family of funds limit (the amount of outstanding leverage allowed for two or more SBIC licenses under common control) to $350 million from $225 million. In addition, during the 115 th Congress, P. L. 115-31, the Consolidated appropriations act for FY2017, and P.L.-115-141, the consolidated appropriations bill for FY2018, increased funding for SBA programs to provide disaster assistance in response to major hurricanes, disaster assistance supplemental, business loan credit subsidies, and other programs.
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952, as amended, enumerates categories of aliens, known as nonimmigrants, who are admitted to the United States for a temporary period of time and a specific purpose. Nonimmigrant visa categories are identified by letters and numbers, based on the sections of the INA that established them. The H-2B Nonagricultural Worker Visa allows for the temporary admission of foreign workers to the U.S. to perform nonagriculture labor or services of a temporary nature if unemployed United States workers are not available. By regulation, participation in the program is limited to designated countries, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) publishes a list of eligible countries each year. The INA grants enforcement authority with respect to the program to DHS, but allows the delegation of that authority to the Departments of Labor (DOL) and State. DHS has delegated this authority to DOL, and now DOL's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) has responsibility for enforcing compliance with the conditions of an H2B petition and temporary labor certification. In FY2019, Congress has enacted a special provision to allow for the issuance of an additional 30,000 H–2B visas beyond the annual statutory cap of 66,000 in response to high levels of demand for the visa. This is the fourth year in a row that Congress has authorized DHS to make these additional visas available subject to certain conditions. For FY2017 and FY2018, DHS used the authority to make an additional 15,000 visas available each year, and for FY2016 and FY2017, Congress exempted certain workers from the statutory cap. In May 2018, DHS and DOL jointly published a final rule to implement the FY2018 provision. The FY2018 rule temporarily amended DHS regulations to state that for FY2018 the Secretary of DHS had authorized issuance of up to15,000 additional H– 2B visas. In addition, DHS decided to limit eligibility for the additional visas to certain U. S. businesses that would likely suffer irreparable harm without the ability to employ all the requested H- 2B workers. As a result, it conducted a second FY2018 H-1B lottery on June 7, 2018, to randomly select a sufficient number of petitions to meet the supplemental cap. For the second half of FY2019 (FY2019), employer demand for H-3B visas and associated temporary labor certifications reached new heights. On January 1, 2019, DOL announced that due to high demand its iCERT online application filing system had "experienced a system disruption" that prevented some employers from submitting their applications for FY2019 certifications. When the system re-opened on January 7, it "handled the submission of approximately 4,749 applications covering more than 87,900 workers positions for an April 1,2019, start date of work within the first one hour of operation." This experience led DOL to announce additional process changes for FY2020, as described below. In February 2019, in light of its experience with the January 2019 submissions and the unanticipated "burdens" placed on "its electronic filing system, network infrastructure, and staff resources," DOL also announced new H-22B application processing changes for the first half of the FY2020 filing period. DOL plans for the new procedures to take effect on July 3, 2019.
The Good Friday Agreement (also known as the Belfast Agreement) was signed by the United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland on April 10, 1998 (the day on which it was concluded). It sought to bring an end to the long-running political conflict in Northern Ireland, which had claimed almost 3,500 lives between 1969 and 1999. The agreement called for the establishment of a new devolved government in Belfast, with unionist and nationalist parties sharing power in a new Assembly and Executive. It also contained provisions on several issues viewed as central to the peace process: decommissioning (disarmament) of paramilitary weapons; policing; human rights; UK security normalization (demilitarization); and the status of prisoners. After 27 years of direct rule from London, authority over local affairs was transferred from London to Belfast in December 1999 and devolved to Belfast's Assembly in December 2000. After a period of instability in 2002-2003, the Assembly was restored in October 2002, and a power-sharing government was established in March 2007. In March 2007, the British army ended its 38-year-long military operation in Northern Belfast in the context of the improved security situation and the Good Friday agreement. In 2010, the UK government transferred policing and justice powers to Belfast, and in March 2011, the Northern Ireland Assembly concluded its first full term in office in 40 years. The regularly scheduled Assembly elections in May 2011 and May 2016 produced successive power- sharing governments led by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein. In January 2017, after only 10 months in office, the DUP-Sinn Fein government led by First Minister Arlene Foster of the DUP and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein collapsed, prompting snap Assembly elections. For the first time in the Assembly, unionist parties will not have an overall majority (a largely symbolic status but highly emblematic for the unionist community). The DUP retained the largest number of seats, but Sinn Fein was widely regarded as the biggest winner given its success in reducing the previous gap between the two parties from 10 seats to 1. A high voter turnout of almost 65%—fueled by anger over the RHI energy scandal and a perceived lack of concern from London about the pending exit from the European Union (EU)—appears to have favored Sinn Fein and the cross-community Alliance Party. Two years after Assembly elections, Northern Ireland remains without a devolution government. Negotiations have proceeded in fits and starts but appear to be stalemated at present. Press reports indicate that the biggest sticking point is Sinn Fein's demand for a stand-alone Irish Language Act, which the DUP continues to oppose. Some analysts suggest that the June 2017 UK general election, which resulted in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party losing its majority in the House of Commons and forming a minority government that relies on support from the DUP, has hardened the positions of both parties and made reaching an agreement on a newdevolved government more difficult. In February 2018, media reports signaled that the parties were close to reaching a deal to restore the devolution of power, but no deal materialized. Some observers contend that the ongoing internal debate within the UK on Brexit—and in particular, the "backstop" designed to ensure no "hard" land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland following the UK's departure from the EU—has consumed UK and Northern Ireland politicians' time and attention and has largely overshadowed discussions on reestablishing a new government. Many in the UK have expressed concern that Brexit could lead to a return of a hard border with Ireland and destabilize the fragile peace process. The Irish government, however, has resisted making any plans for physical infrastructure on the Irish border and insists that an arrangement similar to the backstop would have to be negotiated even if there is no approved UK withdrawal agreement. The UK Parliament decisively rejected the withdrawal agreement by a vote of 432 to 202 on January 15, 2019. This has intensified fears about a disorderly "no deal" scenario in which the UK would "crash out" of the EU at the end of March without a transition period and settled arrangements in place.
The Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Surety Bond Guarantee Program is designed to increase small businesses' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracting, by guaranteeing bid, performance, payment, and specified ancillary bonds "on contracts … for small and emerging contractors who cannot obtain bonding through regular commercial channels." A surety bond is a three-party instrument between a surety (that agrees to be responsible for the debt or obligation of another), a contractor, and a project owner. The agreement binds the contractor to comply with the contract's terms and conditions. If the contractor is unable to successfully perform the contract, the surety assumes the contractor's responsibilities and ensures that the project is completed. Surety bonds are viewed as a means to encourage project owners to contract with small businesses that may not have the credit history or prior experience of larger businesses and are considered to be at greater risk of failing to comply in the event of a contract breach. The SBA guarantees up to $6.5 million in bonds for each contract awarded under the program, and up to a maximum of $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds (a payment bond, performance bond, or both a payment and performance bond) with a total contract value of nearly $5.5 billion. The number and amount of final bonds guaranteed by the program has generally increased in recent years. The program has experienced a net positive cash flow in each of the past 12 fiscal years. Historically, the program's default rate has averaged about 3% to 5%. The program's maximum individual contract amount has increased from $2 million to $5 million, and the maximum contract amount that can be guaranteed has increased to $10 billion. In addition, the maximum individual surety contract amount is periodically adjusted for inflation. In the 111th Congress, P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, provided the program an additional appropriation of $15 million and temporarily increased, from February 17, 2009, through September 30, 2010, the amount of the maximum bond amount. The act also authorized the program to guarantee a bond of up to the size standard for the primary industry in which such business concern, and its affiliates, is engaged, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with the North American Industry Classification System. The Obama Administration advocated, as part of its proposed American Jobs Act, a temporary increase in the bond limit to $3 million until the end of FY2012. On December 12, 2012, the Senate Committee on Appropriations released its draft of the Hurricane Sandy Emergency Assistance Supplemental bill (H.R. 4310), which would have provided an additional $60.4 billion in federal resources to address damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. The draft bill included a provision to increase the programs guarantee rate from not to exceed 70% to 90% of losses and to specify requirements concerning the pledge of assets by individual sureties, subject to a one-year delay "to allow for the necessary rulemaking." This provision was later removed from the final version of the bill, which was passed by the House on May 22, 2014, and became law on a permanent statutory basis on June 30, 2014. The House-passed version of H.J.Res. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, included the provision, but the Senate version did not. The conference agreement for the bill did not, and it was not reported by a committee for consideration by either the House or the Senate. This report provides a brief overview of the program and its legislative origin. It also provides a historical summary of the major issues that have influenced its development, including the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with a Preferred Surety bond guarantee program (PSB program) that initially provided SBA-approved su reties a lower guarantee rate than those participating in the prior program (not to exceed 80% or 90%, depending on the size of the contract and the type of small business) in exchange for allowing preferred suretied bonds to be issued to small businesses without SBA's prior approval;    the decision in FY2016 to raise the PSB program's guarantee rate to 90%, and the decision, as of September 20, 2017, to increase its maximum
The Small Business Administration (SBA) currently administers several types of programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small businesses' access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to aid in their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist in business formation and expansion. Congressional interest in these programs has increased in recent years, primarily because small businesses are viewed as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. Many Members of Congress also regularly receive constituent inquiries about the SBA's programs. SBA appropriations, as a whole, have varied significantly from year to year since FY2000 and across all three major SBA spending categories: appropriations for disaster assistance, business loan credit subsidies, and "other programs," a spending category that includes appropriations for salaries and expenses, business loans administration, the Office of Inspector General, the offices of Advocacy and Advocacy, and entrepreneurial development noncredit programs. The variation in appropriations for Disaster Assistance is largely due to supplemental appropriations provided to address disaster needs arising from the impact of major hurricanes, such as Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Business Loan Credit subsidies represent the net present value of cash flows to and from the agency over the life of the agency's loan portfolios. During good economic times, revenue from fees and collateral liquidation is typically sufficient to cover the costs of purchasing defaulted loans. During and immediately following economic slowdowns, however, revenue is typically insufficient to cover those costs. The shortfall occurs because the cost of purchasing guaranteed loans tends to increase when the economy slows and revenue from loan liquidation tends to be constrained during slow economic times. As a result, additional appropriations are needed to cover these expenses, which are guaranteed by the "full faith and credit of the United States." Since FY2000, appropriations for the other programs spending category have generally increased at a pace that exceeds inflation. In addition, Congress approved significant, temporary increases for SBA programs in the other program spending category in FY2009 and FY2010. These increases were intended primarily to enhance the access of small businesses to capital, which had become constrained during and immediately after the Great Recession (December 2007 to June 2009). Other programs spending includes the following five main components: (1) salary and expenses; (2) business loan administration; (3) office operating budgets; (4) employee compensation and benefits; (5) reimbursable expenses for programs for which the agency receives reimbursements from other federal government agencies; (6) entrepreneurial development (ED) non credit programs; and (7) the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) program, which provides free or low-cost assistance to small businesses using programs customized to local conditions. The SBA also provides financial assistance to SCORE (formerly the Service Corps of Retired Executives) to provide in-person mentoring and online training to small business owners and prospective owners. Women Business Centers (WBCs) provide financial, management, and marketing assistance to start-up businesses owned and controlled by women.
The role of cash as a payment system in the U.S. economy has been steadily declining in recent years. Electronic forms of payment have become increasingly available, convenient, and cost efficient. In addition, new payment methods (e.g., PayPal's Venmo app and Square's point-of-sale hardware, among others) use underlying traditional banking and payments systems to make electronic payments less expensive and more available to individuals and small businesses. Newer digital currencies, such as cryptocurrencies, offer alternative (though not yet widely adopted) options that have a high degree of independence from traditional systems. Although cash remains an important method of payment in the United States, anecdotal reporting suggests that various electronic payment systems have become so effective and inexpensive relative to cash payments that some businesses—even those at which sales generally have a low dollar value—are increasingly choosing not to accept cash. Some observers have examined the consequences of an evolution away from cash. Proponents of reducing the use of physical currency (or even eliminating it all together and becoming a cashless society) argue that it will generate important benefits, including potentially improved efficiency of the payment system, a reduction of crime, and less constrained monetary policy. Critics argue that significant reductions in cash usage and acceptance would further marginalize people with limited access to the financial system, increase the financial systems' vulnerability to cyberattack, and reduce personal privacy. Although it is difficult to imagine conditions under which cash would be replaced entirely, and disappear from the economy, at least in the near future, policymakers may face decisions about whether to impede or hasten the decline of cash and consider the implications of doing so. If noncash payment systems significantly displace cash and cash use and acceptance significantly declines, there would be a number of effects (both positive and negative) on the economy and society. For example, reducing or eliminating cash payments could reduce crime by making operating an illegal enterprise more difficult and certain crimes less remunerative. It could also reduce the ability of the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to implement monetary policy by reducing the amount of cash in circulation, which could reduce the Fed's ability to transmit negative interest rates to the economy. However, reducing cash could also have negative effects on certain segments of the population who lack access to financial services, including the unbanked and underbanked, as well as individuals who have low balances in their bank accounts. Finally, eliminating cash could have a negative effect on the government, as it could reduce government revenues, which are already low because of the tax gap—the difference between what the government is owed and what is actually paid. The potential implications of a reduced role for cash in the economy are discussed in this report. This report will be updated as events warrant.
Water infrastructure issues, particularly regarding funding, continue to receive attention from some Members of Congress and a wide array of stakeholders. Localities are primarily responsible for providing wastewater and drinking water infrastructure services. Capital investments in water infrastructure are necessary to maintain high quality service that protects public health and the environment, and capital facilities are a major investment for local governments. The vast majority of public capital projects are debt-financed (i.e., they are not financed on a pay-as-you-go basis from ongoing revenues to the water utility). The principal financing tool that local governments use is the issuance of tax-exempt municipal bonds. At least 70% of U.S. water utilities rely on municipal bonds and other debt to some degree to finance capital investments. Beyond municipal bonds, federal assistance through grants and loans is available for some projects but is insufficient to meet all needs. Finally, public-private partnerships (P3s), which are long-term contractual arrangements between a public utility and a private company, currently provide only limited capital financing in the water sector. In 2014, Congress established the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, which creates a new mechanism of providing financial assistance for water infrastructure projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014, P.L. 113-121) established a five-year WIFIA pilot program. The act authorized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide credit assistance (loans or loan guarantees) for a range of drinking water and wastewater projects and the Army Corps of Engineers to provide similar assistance for flood control or hurricane and storm damage reduction projects. To implement the program, the act authorized appropriations of $175 million over five years to both EPA and the Corps (beginning with $20 million for each agency in FY2015 and increasing to $50 million in FY2019). Congress provided appropriations to EPA to administer the program in FY2014. In FY2017, Congress provided the first appropriations for EPA to offer credit assistance, such as direct loans, under the program. In 2018, America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA) reauthorized appropriations for the program and amended certain WifIA provisions. AWIA, enacted on October 23, 2018, authorized an additional $5 million in appropriations for FY2020 and FY2021 to provide additional credit assistance to state finance authorities to support combined projects eligible for assistance from the WIFI program. This additional appropriation authority is available only if (1) Congress appropriates funding for both the Water Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (CWSRF) and the Water infrastructure program (WRCF) at FY2018 levels or 105% or more of the previous year's funding, whichever is greater, and (2) EPA receives at least $50.0 million in W IFIA appropriations. In addition, AWIA required the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to Congress (four years after enactment, i.e, June 10, 2018) on the program's status and provide recommendations for continuing, changing, or terminating the program; AWIA extended the deadline for this report. In the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget proposal, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated a 0.91% subsidy rate for WIFia. This equates to a 1:110 ratio. At this subsidy rate, a $10 million appropriation could support a direct loan (or loans) totaling $1.10 billion in FY2020. However, OMB's subsidy rate is an estimate for budgetary purposes, and the actual subsidy rate will be determined for each project at the time of loan obligation.
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires that the nation's transportation fuel supply contains renewable fuels. This mandate—established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05; P.L. 109-58) and expanded in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P,L. 110-140)—requires the use of renewable fuel, although it does not explicitly require the production of that fuel. Rather, it requires that, on an annual average basis, transportation fuel sold or introduced into commerce in the United States contain a specified amount of a renewable fuel. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the mandate, which is an amendment to Clean Air Act (CAA) provisions governing the regulation of fuels. The statutory renewable fuel volume increases annually until 2022, with EPA determining the volume after 2022 within certain limitations. In general, EPA has the authority to waive the RFS requirements, in whole or in part, if certain conditions outlined in statute prevail. The RFS mandate, as amended by EISA, calls for the consumption of 9 billion gallons of total renewable fuel in 2008, ascending to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The statute identifies four categories of renewable fuels that must be used to meet the mandate. However, these four categories can be aggregated into two major categories: unspecified biofuel (mainly cornstarch ethanol) and advanced bio fuel (e.g., cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, and other advanced biofuels), shown in Figure 1. Over time, the growth in theRFS transitions from biofuELs that, in practice, are made mostly from food and feed crops to biofuels made from nonfood and nonfeed crops. For instance, in 2022, the statute requires that advanced biofuel volumes constitute close to 60% of the 36 billion gallon mandate and unspecified bio fuels constitute about 40%. The statutory provisions also contain three separate waivers that the EPA Administrator may use to waive, in part or in whole, the renewable fuel volumes specified in statute. The Administrator has used the waivers for 2014, 2015, and 2016 to reduce the total renewable Fuel (including a lowering of the unspecified bio fuel mandate), advanced Biofuel, and Cellulosic Biofuel volume requirements. For example, in November 2018, the Administrator announced that he would waive the cellulosIC biofuel volume requirement for 2019. The waiver authority is intended to assist EPA with implementation of the R FS. In addition, the waiver authority allows the Administrator to modify the applicable volumes of the mandate starting in 2016 if certain requirements are met. The EPA Administrator is required to set the modified amounts by November 30 of the preceding year. In early 2019, EPA reports that it will issue a rulemaking that proposes to "reset" the target volumes for the years 2020-2022. The reset section of the waiver provision for total renewable fuels has triggered the 2019 final rule. Previous final rules had already triggered a reset for both advanced bio fuels and cellulosics. Going forward, reset implementation could have implications for the entire fuel industry, given the potential for EPA to reduce applicable volumes or maintain ambitious targets.
U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF) are those active and reserve component forces of the services designated by the Secretary of Defense and specifically organized, trained, and equipped to conduct and support special operations. Special operations are military operations requiring unique modes of employment, tactical techniques, equipment, and training. These operations are often conducted in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive environments and are characterized by one or more of the following elements: time sensitive, clandestine, low visibility, conducted with and/or through indigenous forces, requiring regional expertise, or a high degree of risk. In 1986, Congress passed legislation (P.L. 99-661) to strengthen special operations' position within the defense community and to strengthen interoperability among the branches of U. S. SOF. These actions included the establishment of USSOCOM as a new unified command. As of 2019, USSOCom consists of over 70,000 active duty, reserve, National Guard, and civilian personnel assigned to its headquarters (about 2,500 personnel), its four components, and sub-unified commands.USSOCOM's components are the Army Special Operations Command (USASOC); the Naval Special Warfare Command (NSWC); the Air Force Special Operationscommand (AFSOC); and the Marine Corps Forces Special OperationsCommand (MARSOC). The Joint Special Operations command (JSOC) is a sub- unified command of the U.N. Command, located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Theater-level command and control responsibilities are vested in Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs). TSOCs are special operational headquarters elements designed to support a Geographic Combatant Commanders' (GCC) special operations logistics, planning, and operational command andcontrol requirements, and are normally commanded by a general officer. In February 2013, based on a request from USSOC OM and with the concurrence of every geographic and functional combatant commander and military service chiefs and Secretaries, the Secretaryof Defense transferred combatant command of TSOC's from the GCCs to USS OCOM. This means USSOCCOM has the responsibility to organize, train, and equip TSOC, as it previously had for all assigned SOF units as specified in U.s. Code, Title 10, Section 167. This change is intended to enable USSOCO to standardize, to the extent possible, TSOC capabilities and manpower requirements. While USSOCOCOM is now responsible for the organizing, training, and equipping of TS OCs, the GCC's continue to have operational control over the TSOC and all special operations in their respective theaters. TSOC commanders are the senior SOF advisors for their respective GCCs. Each TSOC is capable of forming the core of a joint task force headquarters for short-term operations, and can provide command and Control for all SOF in theater on a continuous basis. The services have what the DOD calls "Combatant Command Service Agency (CCSA)" responsibilities for providing manpower, non-SOF peculiar equipment and logistic support to the TSOs. This report will be updated as events warrant.
This report provides an introduction to select issues related to sub-Saharan Africa (henceforth, "Africa," unless othrwise noted) and U.S. policy toward the region. It includes general information concerning Africa's economic and development challenges, governance and human rights trends on the continent, and key issues relating to peace and security. It also provides an overview of U. S. engagement in Africa and currentU.S.-Africa policy approaches. This report is intended to serve as a primer to help inform deliberations on key enduring issues for Congress, which include the authorization and appropriation of funding for foreign aid programs and military activities in the region and oversight of these programs and policies. Other CRS products address in greater depth many of the topics considered in this report; several are cited in footnotes. Starting in the early 2000s, many countries in Africa exhibited high rates of economic growth. Buoyed by high commodity prices and strong domestic demand, some countries experienced middle class expansion, rapid growth in access to digital communications, and progress toward some of the U.N. Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), albeit starting from a low base by global standards. Outcomes varied widely across the region, however. Resource-rich states broadly recorded higher growth but achieved smaller declines in poverty and poorer progress toward human development than their resource-poor counterparts. Many African countries have confronted economic headwinds since 2014, as weak global commodity prices have hampered economic activity. Regional average gross domestic product (GDP) growth dropped from 5% in 2013 to 2.7% in 2016, before recovering slightly to 3.3% in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Many African economies remain undiversified and rely on raw or minimally processed commodity exports, especially in the energy, mining, and agricultural sectors. Meanwhile, public debt-to-GDP levels, which fell sharply in the 2000s due to concerted debt relief efforts by international lenders, are rising in multiple countries. In early 2018, the World Bank classified 18 African countries as being "at high risk of debt distress," up from eight in 2013. The World Bank attributed the trend to rising fiscal deficits and weak exchange rates, notably in commodity exporting states. Since the early 1990s, nearly all African states have transitioned from military or single-party rule to at least nominally multiparty political systems in which elections are held regularly. Broadly, while states in Southern and coastal West Africa have seen substantial improvements in democratic governance, East and Central Africa "have suffered major setbacks." Civil liberties trends generally follow this pattern. Progress in West and Southern Africa, however, remains fragile. Several Southern African states with relatively strong institutions (e.g., South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia) remain dominated by single parties born during liberation struggles against colonial or white-minority rule. In much of Africa, the development of accountable, functional democratic institutions remains limited. Even some countries that regularly hold democratic elections exhibit few effective internal checks and balances. Accountability for high-level crimes, such as the resignation of President Jacob Zuma of South Africa in early 2018 due to multiple corruption scandals, remains the exception rather than the rule in Africa. State institutions in Africa often fail to respond adequately to citizens' needs because they lack human and financial capacity or are beset by corruption and mismanagement. Human rights conditions vary widely across Africa. Several countries have maintained generally positive human rights records in recent years but continue to face challenges such as security abuses, poor prison conditions, violence against women and children, discrimination against vulnerable groups, and human trafficking. Armed conflict and instability continue to threaten regional security, impede development, and contribute to human suffering in parts of Africa. Beyond internal conflicts, the region faces diverse transnational threats, including from terrorist groups, illicit trafficking, wildlife crime, and maritime piracy. The United States has a large military presence in Africa, including in Somalia, Djibouti, and Libya, as well as in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, and Mali. The Trump Administration has broadened the scope of the United States' role in Africa to include counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and humanitarian assistance, among other areas. The Administration has also sought to reduce and reallocate aid funding for Africa. The 115th Congress in the House (H.R. 6385) and Senate (S. 3108) largely did not adopt the Trump Administration's FY
The President's budget for FY2020 consists of a multivolume set of materials issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The materials contain information on new budget proposals, summary tables, detailed financial information on individual programs and accounts, economic analysis, historical data, explanations of the budget processes, and supporting documents. The President's submission is required on or after the first Monday in January, but no later than thefirst Monday in February (31 U.S.C. §1105(a). This year the President released the budget submission, in two installments, on March 11, and March 18, 2019. This report provides an analysis of the President's budgetary proposals and the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) updated baseline budget projections. The FY2020 report should be forthcoming. (GPO ordering information is currently not available.) Budget and Economic Outlook: FY2019-FY2029 CBO's baseline budget projection reports typically span 11 fiscal years in its reports. It includes projections of budget baselines, receipts, and outlays; deficits; debt; discretionary spending; and economic projections from FY2019 to FY2029. The Budget of the United States Government, FY2020: Major Savings and Reforms The annual budget volume contains information, charts, and graphs pertaining to the Administration's new budget proposal and overviews of government activities by topic (e.g., "Modernizing Government" and "A Budget for a Better American") within the FY2020 Budget volume. Federal programs that have been recommended by the Administration for termination or reduction are detailed in the document entitled Major savings and reforms, available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/msar-fy2020.pdf . The Congressional Research Service (CRS) products on the federal budget process include Explanations of budget concepts, terminology, congressional and executive budget process, congressional budget timetable, budget resolutions and reconciliation, the authorization and appropriations process, entitlements and discretionary spending, the Budget Enforcement Act, sequestration, and surpluses/deficits. The public may access Congress.gov, the legislative website produced by the Library of Congress. The site includes a Status of Appropriations Legislation for the current year and several previous fiscal years, which includes links to bills, committee and conference reports, and votes for the 12 regular, and any supplemental, appropriations bills. The CRS Appropriations Status Table, a table which tracks the progress of major actions related to appropriations bills, is available at https://crsreports.congress.gov/. This report will be updated as warranted.
The Social Security full retirement age (FRA) is the age at which workers can first claim full Social Security retired-worker benefits. The FRA was 65 at the inception of Social Security in the 1930s. As part of legislation enacted in 1983, the FRA is increasing gradually from 65 to 67 over a 22-year period that started for those who turned age 62 in 2000. The increase in the age to claim benefits is intended to ensure that workers who claim benefits after the age of 62 receive roughly the same total lifetime benefits as if they had claimed benefits earlier (based on average life expectancy). The Social Security system once again faces projected long-range funding shortfalls. Over the years, many proposals have been designed to improve Social Security's financial outlook as well as achieve other policy goals. A common proposal is to increase the early eligibility age or further increase the full retirement rate. In 2010, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (also called the Simpson-Bowles Commission after co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles) recommended increasing both the early retirement age and the retirement age, among other Social Security changes. In 2016, the S.O.S. Act of 2016 (H.R. 5747, the 114th Congress) proposed increasing the age for claiming Social Security retirement benefits to 67 for those attaining 62 in 2022. Under the proposal, the age would increase by two months per year until it reaches 69 for those reaching 62 in 2034. Thereafter, it would increase one month every year until the age reaches 69. SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) projects that this option would improve the Social Security trust fund outlook by eliminating 39% of the system's long-term funding shortfall. In addition, OCACT estimates that this proposal would improve Social security's financial condition by eliminating 15% of its projected long range funding shortfall, based on intermediate assumptions. This report will be updated as warranted by legislative events. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33487, Social Security: Issues for Congress, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10130, Social security: Social Security Trust Fund Outlook and Policy Considerations for Congress and the 111th Congress, both by [ author name scrubbing]. For additional background on Social Security, see also CRS Issue Brief IB95033, The Early Eligibility Age (EEA) and Full Retirement Age (FFR) for Social Security.

Section 420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288, hereinafter the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to "declare" a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG). The current FMAG system was established by regulation in October of 2001. These grants provide federal assistance for fire suppression activities. FMAGs are funded through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), the main account FEMA uses to provide disaster assistance. The DRF is a no-year account—unused funds from the previous fiscal year are carried over to the next fiscal year. The FMAG is a direct relationship with the states to assist the state in fighting the fire on state lands. The Forest Service and other federal agencies do provide other types of assistance related to wildfire management, such as postfire recovery assistance, or assistance planning and mitigating the potential risk from future wildfires. This report discusses the most frequently asked questions received by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) regarding the FMAG process. It addresses questions regarding how requests are requested, how requests for assistance are evaluated using thresholds, and the type of assistance provided under an FMAG declaration. It will be updated as events warrant.

The diminishment of Arctic sea ice has led to increased human activities in the Arctic, and has heightened interest in, and concerns about, the region's future. Issues such as Arctic territorial disputes; commercial shipping through the Arctic; Arctic oil, gas, and mineral exploration; endangered Arctic species; and increased military operations could cause the region in coming years to become an arena of international cooperation or competition. The United States, by virtue of Alaska, is an Arctic country and has substantial political, economic, energy, environmental, and other interests in the region. Decisions that Congress makes on Arctic-related issues could significantly affect these interests. This report provides an overview of Arctic- related issues for Congress, and refers readers to more in-depth CRS reports on specific Arctic-specific issues. Congressional readers with questions about an issue discussed in this report should contact the author or authors of the section discussing that issue. The authors are identified by footnote at the start of each section. For tracking of legislative activity, see the CRS report relating to specific Arctic issues that are listed at the end of this report, just prior to Appendix A. The Arctic Research and Policy Act (ARPA) of 1984 (Title I of P.L. 98-373 of July 31, 1984) defines the Arctic as the land and sea area north of the Arctic Circle (a circle of latitude at about 66.34 o North). The Arctic Circle definition includes the northernmost third or so of Alaska as well as the Chukchi Sea, which separates that part of Alaska from Russia, and U.S. territorial and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters north of Alaska. It does not include the lower two-thirds or more of Alaska or the Bering Sea. The area within the Arctic circle is about 14.5 million square kilometers, or about 5.6 million square miles. This equates to about 2.8%, or about 1/36th, of the world's surface. About 4 million people, or 0.05% of theworld's population, live within this area, of which roughly half (roughly 2 million) live in Russia's part of Arctic. Eight countries have territory north of Arctic Circle: the United States (Alaska), Canada, Russia, Norway, Denmark (by virtue of Greenland, a member country of the Kingdom of Denmark), Finland, Sweden, and Iceland. These eight countries are often referred to as the Arctic countries. A subset of the eight Arctic countries are the five countries that are considered Arctic coastal states: theUnited States, Canada, Russian, Norwegian, and Denmark. These five countries are also member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Arctic Council (Arctic Council). The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (U.N. Convention on Climate Change, or UNCLOS) was established in 1992 to address climate change and its effects on the Arctic. The U.N.'s Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (UNICEF) was created in 1993 to address the plight of threatened and endangered species. The Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution and its protocols and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (the Montreal Protocol) were established in 1994 to address air pollution in the Montreal region of Canada and the Pacific Ocean. In the Arctic region, the United Nations and its specialized agencies have established a number of agreements and treaties to address environmental, social, and economic issues related to the region, such as the Convention for the Implementation of the Provisions of the UN Convention on climate change, the Convention on Endangered species of wild fauna andFlora, and the Convention to protect the Arctic's vulnerable marine ecosystems. In May 2013, the Obama Administration released a document entitled National Strategy for the Arctic Region. The executive summary of the document states that the strategy is intended to position the United states to respond effectively to challenges and emerging opportunities arising from significant increases in Arctic activity due to the diminish of sea ice and the emergence of a new Arctic environment. On January 30, 2014, the Administration released an implementation plan for the May 2013 national strategy. The plan states that it complements and builds upon existing initiatives by Federal, State, local, and tribal authorities, the private sector, and international partners, and focuses efforts where opportunities exist and action is most needed. The Implementation Plan reflects the reality of a changing Arctic
In the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Navy carried out a variety of irregular warfare (IW) and counterterrorism (CT) activities. Among the most readily visible of these were operations carried out by Navy sailors serving ashore in the Middle East and Afghanistan. The Navy's IW and CT activities pose a number of potential oversight issues for Congress, including how much emphasis to place on these activities in Navy budgets, particularly in a context of constraints on Navy budgets and Navy desires to devote resources to developing "high end" combat capabilities for countering improved conventional military capabilities of countries such as China and Russia. This report focuses on Navy IW operations. Another CRS report discusses U.S. special operations forces (SOF) across the military services. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which Navy Iw and CT operations may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke. The Department of Defense's (DOD's) proposed FY2020 budget requests, among other things, $72.6 million in the FY2020 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Defense-Wide (RDT&EDW) account for Program Element (PE) 1160483BB, (Special Operations Command [SOCOM] maritime systems, including $45.2 million for Project S0417: Underwater Systems, and $27.4 million for S1684: Surface Craft; and $59.0 million for procurement of underwater systems for SOCOM (line 63 in the PDW account). The Navy has a long history of conducting irregular warfare and counterterrorism operations, including operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, and other locations in Africa, and operations in the Persian Gulf region. In recent years, the Department of the Navy has taken actions intended to improve its IW capabilities and activities, including the establishment of a Navy Irregular Warfare Office (NIWO) in July 2008 to institutionalize current ad hoc IW missions of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency and the supporting missions of information sharing, intelligence operations, foreign defense operations, and unconventional warfare as they apply to [CT] and [counter insurgency] operations. In January 2010, the Secretary of Defense issued a vision statement for irregular warfare that outlined the Navy's vision for IW activities. The vision statement included the following: "The Navy will continue to maintain a forward-deployed presence around the world to prevent conflict, increase interoperability with our allies, enhance the maritime security and capacity of our traditional and emerging partners, confront irregular challenges, and respond to crises. To continue as a global force in the preventive and responsive mission areas that confront irregular Challenges, including those of irregular Challenges the Navy will be faced with increasing demand in a fiscally induced capacity constrained environment. Constrained capacity requires a prioritization of areas requiring persistent presence, to include those regions of current or forecast instability. Also required is an understanding of the risk incurred to mission, and to force, if we do not get that priority correct. We must ensure our Navy remains the finest, best trained, and most ready in the world, to sustain key missions that support confronting irregular challenges and has the ability to face a highly capable adversary." This report will be updated as events warrant.
The Constitution (Article I, Section 5) states that "the Yeas and Nays of the Members ... on any question" shall be obtained "at the Desire of one fifth of those present." Under this provision, it does not matter if a quorum of the House (218 Members when the House has no vacancies) is not present to conduct business, because any Member can say, "Mr. or Madam [or Madam] Speaker, on that vote, I demand the yeas and nays." If at least one-fifth of the quorum (44 of 218) supports the request, then the recorded vote will be taken by electronic device. In the House, there are four forms of votes: voice vote, division vote, yea and nay (or roll call) vote, and recorded vote. The Speaker counts division votes and determines if there is sufficient support for yea or nay votes and recorded votes. In addition, the Speaker also has the authority to postpone and cluster certain votes. For most questions, postponed votes occur within two legislative days. A vote to agree to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, however, is to occur within the same legislative day. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants.

The federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. ), and is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA). The program is designed to protect crop producers from risks associated with adverse weather, as well as weather-related plant diseases and insect infestations and declines in commodity prices. Crop insurance is available for most major crops and many specialty crops (including fruit, tree nut, vegetable, and nursery crops), aswell as forage and pastureland for livestock producers. A producer who chooses to purchase an insurance policy must do so by an administratively determined deadline date, which varies by crop and usually coincides with the planting season. Insurance products that protect against loss in revenue and profit margins are also available. Policies are typically available in major growing regions. For many insurable commodities, an eligible producer can also purchase revenue insurance. Under such a policy, a farmer could receive an indemnity payment when actual farm revenue for a crop falls below the target level of revenue, regardless of whether the shortfall in revenue was caused by poor production or low farm commodity prices, among other factors. Insured producers are also eligible for reduced coverage if they are late or prevented from planting because of flooding. The federal government also subsidizes the costs of selling and servicing the policies (as delivery subsidies to Approved Insurance Providers) and absorbs underwriting losses (indemnities in excess of premiums received) in years when indemnities are high. The annual agriculture appropriations bill traditionally makes two separate appropriations for the program. It provides discretionary funding for the salaries and expenses of the RMA. It also provides "such sums as are necessary" for the FederalCrop Insurance Corporation, which finances all other program expenses, including premium subsidies, indemnity payments, and reimbursements to the private insurance companies. The total cost of the program varies by year, primarily due to fluctuating levels of indemnities. Across all policies, the average premium subsidy was about 63% of total premiums in 2017. For a more detailed analysis of the federal crop Insurance program, see CRS Report R45193, Federal C crop insurance: Program Overview for the 115th Congress, by [author name scrubbed]. The USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers several disaster assistance programs to help producers recover from natural disasters, including the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), and Tree Assistance Program. The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) are administered by FSA. For both programs, FSA pays participants a percentage of the cost to restore the land to a productive state. ECP also funds water for livestock and installing water conserving measures during times of drought. EFRP was created to assist private forestland owners with losses caused by a natural disaster on nonindustrial private forest land. The EWP floodplain easement program is a mitigation program that pays for permanent easements on private land meant to safeguard lives and property from future floods and drought and the products of erosion. The Natural Resources Conservation Service's Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program and the U. S. Forest Service's EWP Floodplain Easement Program are two other programs that assist sponsors, landowners, and operators in implementing emergency recovery measures for runoff retardation and erosion prevention to relieve imminent hazards to life and property. The Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance Programs (LIP, LFP, TAP, and the Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program) and Emergency Disaster Loans (EDLs) are permanent programs that provide disaster assistance for livestock, fruit, and vegetable crops. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-334) authorized $2.36 billion for production losses not covered under NAP or crop insurance. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, also provided supplemental assistance but through an existing program—TAP.
The U.S. farm sector is vast and varied. It encompasses production activities related to traditional field crops (such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton) and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy, and eggs), as well as fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables. The intensity and economic importance of each of these activities vary regionally based on the agro-climatic setting, market conditions, and other factors. As a result, farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the United States. Annual U. S. net farm income is the single most watched indicator of farm sector well-being, as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes, input expenses, and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period. When national net farmincome is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt-to-asset ratio, the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economy as a whole. In the first of three official farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2019, USDA's Economic Research Service (ESR) projects that U.s.net farm income will rise slightly in 2019 to $69.4 billion, up $6.3 billion (+10%) from last year. Net cash income (calculated on a cash-flow basis) is also projected higher in 2019 (+4.7%) to $95.7 billion. However, the initial 2019 net farm Income forecast is below (-18%) the 10-year average of $84.8 billion and represents continued agriculture-sector economic weakness since 2013's record high of $123.9 billion. Abundant domestic and international supplies of grains and oilseeds suggest a fourth straight year of relatively weak commodity prices in 2018, but considerable uncertainty remains concerning the outlook for 2019. The outlook for agricultural exports remains mixed as a result of a tariff-related trade dispute with China and other major trading partners that has reduced China's purchases of U.N. agricultural products in 2018 and likely will continue to do so in 2019. Farm asset values and debt levels are projected to reach record levels in 2019—asset values at $3.1 trillion (+1.5%) and farm debt at $427 billion (+3.9%)—pushing the projected debt-To-Asset ratio up to 13.9%, the highest level since 2002. Farm production choices in 2019 will largely be determined by producers' expectations for relative net returns from both the market and government programs across the various crops and livestock activities. Growing-season weather, yields, and harvest-time market prices are unknown early in the year when producers must lock in their production decisions for the year. Heading into 2019, most of the major growing zones across the Corn Belt, Plain States, Delta, and Southeast are largely free of drought. Some dryness persists primarily in the mountain states, the Pacific Northwest, and southern Texas. Instead of dryness, excessive precipitation and early spring flooding present potential hindrances to the normal crop-choice and planting routines for2019, particularly in the western Corn Belt. Large Corn and Soybean Crops Continue to Dominate Commodity Markets Corn and soybeans are the two largest commercial crops in terms of both value and acreage. The United States is traditionally one of the world's leading exporters of these crops and soybean products—vegetable oil and meal—and the export outlook for these two crops is critical to both farm sector profitability and regional economic activity in large swaths of the United states as well in international markets. The soybean and corn sectors have been particularly affected by the ongoing trade dispute between the UnitedStates and China. The trade dispute has resulted in lower purchases of agricultural products by China in 2018 with continued diminished prospects for2019.
In recent years, the House has adopted a number of changes to House rules related to the consideration of revenue and direct spending legislation. In the 114th Congress, for example, House rules required that any budgetary estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) include, to the extent practicable, a macroeconomic impact analysis as well as a requirement that any estimate provided to CBO by the Joint Committee on Taxation also include a macro economic impact analysis. This language was dropped from Rule XIII for the 116th Congress. In addition, a provision was added to House Rules in the 104th Congress that required the vote of a three-fifths majority to approve a federal income tax rate increase. This provision was dropped in the 105th Congress and was replaced by a provision in Rule XXI that requires the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means to request a dynamic estimate of revenue changes proposed in a measure designated by the majority leader as major tax legislation. The House also adopted a new PAYGO rule in the House that prohibits consideration of direct spending or revenue legislation that is projected to increase or cause a deficit in either of two time periods: (1) the period consisting of the current fiscal year, the budget year, and the four ensuing fiscal years following the budget years or (2) the 11-year period consistingof the current year and the ensuing nine fiscal years. This rule replaced the House CUTGO rule that was adopted at the beginning of the 112th Congress (H.Res. 5 (112th Congress) and was in effect through the end of the 115th Congress). This rule prohibited the House from considering legislation that would have the net effect of increasing direct spending over the two periods noted above. This report provides a brief overview of these rule changes and will be updated as events warrant. For additional information on House rules, see CRS Report RL33498, House Rule Changes Related to the Consideration of Revenue and Direct Spending Legislation, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10101, House Rules Changes Related To the Considerations of Legislation That Is Projected to Increase or Cause A Deficit in Two Time Periods: H.R. 6 and H.Rept. 112th and 115thCongresses, by (author name also scrubbed). This report will not be updated to reflect any further changes in House rules or legislative activity in the 116 th Congress.

The "10-20-30 provision" was implemented in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5). Title I, Section 105 of ARRA required the Secretary of Agriculture to allocate at least 10% of funds provided in that act from three rural development program accounts to persistent poverty counties; that is, to counties that have had poverty rates of 20% or more for the past 30 years, as measured by the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses. One notable characteristic of this provision is that it did not increase spending for the rural development programs addressed in ARRA, but rather targeted existing funds differently. This report discusses how data source selection, and the rounding of poverty estimates, can affect the list of counties identified as persistently poor. In addition, this report explores how "persistent poverty" is defined and measured, and how different interpretations of the definition and different data source selections could yield different lists of counties identify as persistent poverty. The report does not compare the provision's advantages and disadvantages against other policy options, nor does it examine the range of programs or policy goals for which the provision might be an appropriate policy tool. In the 116th Congress, much of the language used in these previous bills was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 116-6). This report will be updated as warranted by legislative events.

This report answers frequently asked questions about U.S. trade policy, focusing on the role of trade in the United States and the global economy. The United States is a major global trader, with trade as a share of global gross domestic product (GDP) rising from 25% in 1960 to about 57% in 2017. In 2017, the top-five largest trading economies (in terms of the value of goods and services trade) were theUnited States, China, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union (EU). China was the largest exporter and the largest importer, while the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) reported that China was also the largest destination for global foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2017, followed by Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Japan. In general, economic globalization broadly refers to the increasing integration of national economies around the world, particularly through trade and financial flows. There have been several periods of economic globalization; some experts also contend there have been periods of deglobalization—the slowdown or reverse of globalization. The growing integration of the world economy has been facilitated by myriad technical advances in transport and communication, which have significantly reduced natural geographic barriers that separate economies. In addition, both domestic and multilateral policies have steadily lowered man-made barriers to international exchange since World War II (such as tariffs, quotas, subsidies, immigration regulations, and capital controls). While most economists argue that globalization has lifted living standards worldwide, an ongoing debate remains regarding the extent to which greater economic integration has been inclusive, benefited some groups more than others, and contributed to inequality within countries. A global value chain (GVC) is the interrelated organizations, resources, and processes that create and deliver a product to the final consumer. GVCs, organized mostly by multinational corporations (MNCs), mean that products once produced in one country may now be produced by assembling parts and components produced in several countries, often traded across borders multiple times. The international fragmentation of production has raised the level of trade associated with a particular final product, as well as trade with advanced economies/emerging markets and developing countries. The growth of global value chains has helped facilitate lower trade barriers and technological advances, making international transport faster and accelerating the flow of information across borders. These linkages have blurred the distinction between exports and imports as strictly domestic or foreign activities. This, in turn, has made it increasingly difficult to understand who benefits from global trade and complicated the interpretation of bilateral trade balances. Trade in intermediates means that imports have become essential inputs into the production of exports; as a result, policies that affect a nation's imports ultimately affect its exports and vice versa. Trade and investment flows are considered to be a major driver of global economic growth. Foreign direct investment is a type of cross-border capital flow, which takes place when a resident of one country (including a company) obtains a lasting interest in—and a degree of influence over—the management of a business enterprise in another country. FDI has supported the significant expansion of inter- and intra-firm trade, which represents trade between parent companies and their foreign affiliates. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) often involves the purchase of foreign equities or bonds, loans to foreign residents, or the opening of foreign bank accounts, and often involves a long-term commitment and can have the advantage of stimulating direct employment for the host country. Foreign firms, particularly those owned or controlled by a foreign government, can raise concerns about national security, particularly by firms owned or owned by foreign governments. Foreign investment can also be viewed as a source of foreign aid, humanitarian assistance, and other types of official assistance to developing countries, such as trade capacity building, to help developing countries improve their capacity to benefit from increased trade. The report begins with a brief explanation of the basic economics of trade, including the basic concept of comparative advantage, which predicts that a country will have comparative advantage in activities that make intensive use of the country's relatively abundant factors of production—such as labor, physical capital (plants and equipment), human capital (skills and knowledge, including entrepreneurial talent), and technology. It then provides a brief overview of the role that trade plays in the U. S. economy, including its role as a driver of economic growth, jobs, wages, and income, and discusses some of the policy issues that may be of interest to Congress.
U.S. policy toward Cuba since the early 1960s has consisted largely of isolating the island nation through comprehensive economic sanctions, including an embargo on trade and financial transactions. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR), which include a prohibition on most financial transactions with Cuba and a freeze of Cuban government assets in the United States, remain the main body of Cuba embargo regulations and have been amended many times over the years to reflect changes in policy. They are administered by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and prohibit financial transactions as well as trade activities with Cuba. The CACR also require that all exports to Cuba be licensed by the Departments of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), under the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (P.L. 96-72; 50 U.C. Appendix 2405(j)). The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are found at 15 C.F.R. Sections 730-774. In addition to the embargo, Congress enacted numerous other laws to impose sanctions on Cuba, including restrictions on trade, foreign aid, and support from international financial institutions. The State Department also designated the government of Cuba as a state sponsor of international terrorism in 1982 because of the country's alleged ties to international terrorism. Beyond sanctions, another component of U.S.-Cuban policy has consisted of support measures for the Cuban people. This support includes private humanitarian donations, medical exports, and radio and television broadcasting to Cuba. Since the end of the Cold War, Congress has played an active role in shaping U. S. policy towards Cuba, first with the enactment of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 (CDA, Title XVII) and then with the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 (LIBERTAD Act, Title III) and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (TSRA, Title IX). Both acts codified the Cuban embargo as permanent law, including all restrictions imposed by the executive branch. The executive branch is prevented from lifting the economic embargo without congressional concurrence through legislation until certain democratic conditions set forth in the law are met, although the President retains broad authority to amend the regulations therein. Another significant sanction in Title III of the law holds any person or government that traffics in Cuban property confiscated by the Cuban government liable for monetary damages in federal court. All Administrations (including the Trump Administration) have suspended the implementation of Title III at six-month intervals, most recently in June 2018 (effective August 1, 2018 through January 2019). In November 2018, National Security Adviser John Bolton maintained in a press interview that the Administration was exploring whether to continue to suspend Title III or to allow lawsuits to go forward. In December 2018, the 115th Congress approved the conference report (H.Rept. 115-1072) to the 2018 farm bill, which retains a Senate provision that permits funding for certain U.N. export promotion programs (Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Cooperation Program) for U.s. agricultural products in Cuba, with the caveat that funds could not be used in contravention of directives under the National Security Presidential Memorandum issued by President Trump in June 2017 that prohibits transactions with entities owned, controlled, or operated by or on behalf of military, intelligence, or security services of Cuba. Congress also approved the FY2018 omnibus appropriations measure, H.R.-3354, in September 2017, which provided $28.936 million for Cuba broadcasting, $5.28 million more than requested, in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which was signed into law in March 2018. For FY2019, the Administration requested $13.656 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), $10 less than the Administration's FY2018 request and $15.3 million less than in FY2017. The rationale for the proposed cut in funding for the OCB was to find efficiencies between OCB and the Voice of America's Latin American division. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2019 State Department and Foreign Operations bill would have provided $29.1 million for OCB, while the Senate Committee's bill, S. 3108, would has provided $ 29.2 million. Congress did not complete action on FY2019 appropriations, leaving the task to the 116th Congress. Nevertheless, a series of continuing resolutions that continued FY2019 funding at FY2018 levels through December 21, 2018 (
Congress has created a wide array of advisory bodies, separate from each chamber's committees and officers, in order to better exercise its legislative, oversight, and investigative mandates, and to attend to both temporary and ongoing administrative tasks and responsibilities. During the past two decades, Congress has established or renewed the existence of hundreds of statutory entities to study, advise on, coordinate, or monitor matters of particular interest to Congress. These entities vary in several dimensions, including their official designation, purpose, lifespan, membership, and mechanism by which members are appointed. Many of these bodies are expressly identified as commissions, but others are designated as boards, advisory committees, or other terms. The statutory provisions creating a substantial proportion of congressional advisory bodies provide for a membership that, either entirely or in part, (1) includes, (2) is chosen by, or (3) is recommended by Members of Congress. This report addresses only those statutory groups whose membership involves congressional participation in one or more of these forms. It provides selected background information on these groups and specific information relating to the role of members of Congress in the appointment process. It also provides a brief overview of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, which authorizes the President to make appointments to advisory bodies established by Congress. The report concludes with observations regarding the rationale and effects for the many variations in the membership schemes for existing advisory bodies. These observations are intended to provide some alternatives to legislators to facilitate the drafting of membership language in potential future statutes. For each advisory body identified in this report, a brief summary of its purpose or role is provided, as well as the following information: Statutory designation of the advisory body; membership composition; appointment structure; membership of the body; appointment of members; role of non-congressional officials; term of appointment; membership recommendations; statutory qualifications; and termination date, where appropriate. For example, this report will be updated as legislative activity warrants.

Enacted in 1937, the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, now known as the Pittman-Robertson Wildli fe Restoration Act (hereinafter referred to as Pittman/Robertson), provides funding for states and territories to support projects that promote the conservation and restoration of wild birds and mammals and their habitats and programs that provide hunter education and safety training and opportunities. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), an agency within the Department of the Interior, administers Pittman–Robertson as part of its Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program. Revenues generated through excise taxes on pistols and revolvers, other firearms, ammunition, bows, and other archery equipment provide the funding for the program. After collection, receipts from these excise taxes are deposited into the Federal Assistance to Wildlife Restoration Fund in the Treasury, and monies from the fund are made available for FWS in the fiscal year following their collection without any further action by Congress. For three programs within the program, FWS apportions the funds directly among the states and the territories. All 50 states as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U. S. Virgin Islands are eligible to receive funding through this program. However, the caps for territorial apportionments for wildlife restoration activities are set in statute: Puerto Rico receives not more than one-half of 1% (0.5%) of the total funds apportioned, and Guam, the Virgin Islands,American Samoa, and American Samoa each receive not-more-than-one-sixth of 1%. Washington, DC, does not receive funding under these programs. States and territories can use their apportionment to support the federal share of wildlife and hunter and safety projects that receive Pittman Robertson funding. For FY2015 through FY2019, states received an average of $4.5 million and territories received $3.3 million per year, on average, for Wildlife Restoration and Hunter Education and Safety programs. For the Wildlife Restoration program, states receive a minimum of 0.5% of the program's total apportioning, Puerto Rico received 0.4%, and each of the remaining four eligible territories received no more than 0.17%. For the Basic Hunter education and Safety program (Section 4(c), states receive at least 1% and territories receive 0.3%, and for the Enhanced Hunter Education & Safety Grants program states receive 1%, and the remaining territories receive 1%. In recent Congresses, some Members have introduced several bills that would amend the way states and Territories are able to spend their apportments. Some bills have proposed amending Pittman—Robertson to allow additional uses, such as hunter recruitment and retention; others have proposed modifying the federal share and eligible uses of funds for existing or related activities. In the 116th Congress, Congress may continue to consider these issues.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology that is capturing the attention of commercial investors, defense intellectuals, policymakers, and international competitors alike, as evidenced by a number of recent initiatives. On July 20, 2017, the Chinese government released a strategy detailing its plan to take the lead in AI by 2030. Less than two months later Vladimir Putin publicly announced Russia's intent to pursue AI technologies, stating, "[W]hoever becomes the leader in this field will rule the world." Similarly, the U.S. National Defense Strategy, released in January 2018, identified artificial intelligence as one of the key technologies that will "ensure [the United States] will be able to fight and win the wars of the future." These dynamics raise several questions that Congress addressed in hearings during 2017 and 2018: What types of military AI applications are possible, and what limits, if any, should be imposed? What unique advantages and vulnerabilities come with employing AI for defense? How will AI change warfare and what influence will it have on the military balance with U. S. competitors? Congress has a numberof oversight, budgetary, and legislative tools available that it may use to influence the answers to these questions and shape the future development of AI technology. Congress may assess the need for new policies or modifications to existing laws to account for AI developments and ensure that AI applications have the potential to be used in a manner that is free from bias. For example, the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) provides a definition of AI for the purposes of Section 238:  Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets. Section 238 of the NDAA also directs the Secretary of Defense to produce a defined definition of artificial intelligence by August 13, 2019. In addition, Congress may consider the adequacy of current DOD funding levels for AI. Although DOD funding for AI has increased in 2018—to include the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center's (JAIC's) $1.75 billion six-year budget and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's $2 billion multiyear investment in over 20 AI programs—some experts have argued that additional DOD funding will be required to keep pace with its competitors and avoid an "innovation deficit" in military technology. Critics of increased federal funding contend that significant increases to appropriations may not be required, as the military should be leveraging research and development (R&D) conducted in the commercial sector. Some experts in the national security community also argue that it would not be a responsible use of taxpayer money to duplicate efforts devoted to AI R&D in the private sector when companies take products 90% of the way to a useable military application. Others contend that anumber of barriers stand in the way of transitioning AI commercial technology to the Department of Defense (DOD), and that reforming aspects of the defense acquisition process may be necessary. These issues are discussed in more detail later in this report.
The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (JJDPA, P.L. 93-415) authorizes a number of federally funded juvenile justice grant programs. The JJDPA has been the primary channel through which the federal government has provided juvenile justice funding to states over the past 40 years. However, other programs also administered by the Department of Justice (DOJ) have contributed to overall federal funding for juvenile justice programs. These include the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) program, which authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to states and units of local government to strengthen their juvenile justice systems, including holding juveniles accountable for their actions; the Victims of Child Abuse Act grants, which provide technical assistance, training, and administrative reforms for state juvenile and family courts to improve the way they handle cases of child abuse and neglect; and the Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Program, which provides grants to state, local, and tribal governments and nongovernmental organizations for programs to develop, test, or demonstrate promising new initiatives that may prevent, control, or reduce juvenile delinquency. Congress appropriates funding for these programs as well as for other juvenile justice-related grant programs through the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. For FY2018, Congress appropriated nearly $283 million for juvenile Justice programs. This was the largest juvenile justice appropriation since FY2010, when Congress appropriated $424 million. From FY2010 to FY2017, total juvenile justice program funding decreased by nearly 42%, from $424.5 million to $247 million. The majority of this reduction came from cuts to the JABG program. During this time period, however, Congress also started appropriating funding for programs that had not previously been funded under the juvenile justice Programs account (including funding for missing and exploited children programs, child abuse training programs for judicial personnel and practitioners, and grants and technical assistance in support of a National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention). Congress increased funding in both FY2018 and FY2019. Congress most recently appropriated $287 million in FY2019 for juvenile programs, which is the largest amount appropriated since FY2012. This report provides a brief overview of juvenile justice legislation and grant programs authorized by the J JDPA. It will be updated as legislative activity warrants. For additional information on juvenile justice, see CRS Report RL33498, Juvenile Criminal Justice: Issues for Congress, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10240, Juveniles in Juvenile Detention: Overview of Federal Programs and Grant Programs authorized under the Juveniles' Criminal Justice Reform Act of 2018.
During the Vietnam War, the U.S. military conducted Operation Ranch Hand, a program that sprayed an estimated 18-20 million gallons of herbicides—including approximately 11-12 million gallon gallons of Agent Orange—over about 12,000 square miles of southern Vietnam between 1961 and 1971. A contaminant of the manufacture of Agent orange (as well as two other herbicides used, Agent Pink and Agent Purple) was 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a developmental toxicant and a probable human carcinogen. Environmental surveys conducted in Vietnam have identified a number of dioxin "hot spots," including the airbases at Bien Hoa, Danang, and Phu Cat, that are contaminated with TCDD well above internationally acceptable levels. In addition, the A Luoi (or A Shau) Valley, south of Quang Tri and west of Danang was considered an important segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a key supply route used by North Vietnamese forces and their allies, and was therefore heavily sprayed. In recent years, the United States' response to the environmental damage and health problems caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam has been viewed as helping to advance bilateral relations between the two nations. Since 2007, Congress has appropriated a total of $254.8 million for environmental remediation and health and disability programs in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or otherwise contaminated with dioxins in Vietnam. The State Department and the United Nations Agency for International Development (USAID) have been responsible for the administration and obligation of the appropriated funds. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), the 115th Congress appropriated in March 2018, "not less than $20 million" for "activities related to the remediation of Dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam." The act also provided that the funds "may be made available for assistance for the Government of Vietnam, including the military, for such purposes." In February 2019, 116th Congress appropriates "not more than $12,500,000 … for health and Disability Programs in Areas Sprayed With Agent Orange and Otherwise Contaminated with Dioxins to assist individuals with severe upper or lower body mobility impairment and/or cognitive or developmental disabilities." Congress has provided oversight of the use of the funds appropriated for these purposes. In particular, it has focused on the rate at which the funds are being obligated, and on USAID's approach to administering those funds. As of May 2018, USAID has obligated 81% of the $127 million appropriated for FY2011-FY2017 for environmental cleanup projects, and 63.5% for health- and disability-related services. Of the $21 million appropriated in FY2007-FY2011 for either environmental cleanup or health-and-disability-related activities in Vietnam, the State Department has obligated $20.3 million, or 96.9%. The manner in which USAID is obligated the funds has, at times, been an issue with Congress. While the rate of obligations for environmental cleanups generally has not been a matter of concern, how USAID have obligated appropriations for health services has drawn some congressional attention. The two main concerns about the health services obligations are the seemingly slower pace of utilization, and the types of programs being funded. The second issue is oversight of how such assistance has been utilized by USAID. In FY2007, Congress appropriated $3 million to support health programs in communities near contaminated sites, and in FY2009 and FY2010 appropriated $18 million for cleanup and related health services in Danang and other parts of Vietnam. Congress has also appropriated $1.9 million in Development Assistance funds in FY2010 for the Danang airport cleanup, and $7 million in FY2013 and FY2014 for health/disability services in areas contaminated with Agent orange. In March 2015, the 114th Congress provided $7.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively, for environmental and health services.
The Jones Act, which refers to Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (P.L. 66-261), requires that vessels transporting cargo from one U.S. point to another U. S. point be U.s.-built, and owned and crewed by American citizens. The act provides a significant degree of protection from foreign competition for U. s. shipyards, domestic carriers, and American merchant sailors. It has been an issue in recent Congresses, coming into prominence amid debates over Puerto Rico's economic challenges and recovery from Hurricane Maria in 2017; in the investigation into the sinking of the 40-year-old ship El Faro with 33 fatalities during a hurricane in 2015; and in discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been the subject of attention in conjunction with a congressional directive that the Administration develop a national maritime strategy, including strategies to increase the use of short sea shipping. In May 2018, the Office of Management and Budget requested public comment on federal requirements that could be modified or repealed to increase efficiency and reduce or eliminate unnecessary or unjustified regulatory burdens in the maritime sector. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships. This is because the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has determined that a cruise ship serving a United States port does not have to be Jones Act-compliant as long as it has visited a distant foreign port (any port outside North and Central America, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Virgin Islands). Thus, for example, if the cruise ship includes Aruba or Curacao in its itinerary, it does not need to be "Jones Act compliant." The reasoning is that the main objective of such a cruise itinerary is to visit such foreign ports, not to transport passengers from one United States to another. In the offshore oil market, CBP's interpretations have affected "lightering" (the transfer of oil offshore from an oil tanker too large to transit a harbor to a smaller vessel) and offshore supply vessels (OSVs) used to supply oil platforms. CBP has decided that if a tanker to be lightered is anchored to the seabed and within 3 nautical miles of shore, it is a "U.S.-owned and -crewed" vessel. However, if a vessel is transporting supplies or workers to an offshore oil rig, or if the vessel is involved in installing equipment necessary for the operation of the rig, it must be " Jones Actcompliant." Some question whether the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act applies to offshore wind farms located beyond 3 miles from shore. Currently, wind farm developers are being guided by CBB's interpretations of the Jones Act with respect to OSVs and oil rigs. Congress has enacted numerous exemptions or exceptions to the act. For instance, in 1984, Congress exempted passenger travel between Puerto Rico and any other U.N.-designated port because no Jones Act qualified operator was able to provide comparable service. This exemption remains in force. In 1996, Congress enacted an exemption for vessels participating in oil spill cleanup operations when an insufficient number of Jones Actqualified vessels are available. In 2011, Congress granted waivers to three liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers built in the United States in the late 1970s that subsequently became foreign-registered. Since 1989, at least 133 specific vessels have been granted Jones Act waivers by Congress in 16 separate legislative acts.
The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) is an exercise of Congress's power to raise and support armies and to declare war. The purpose of the act is to provide for, strengthen, and expedite the national defense by protecting servicemembrance, enabling them to "devote their entire energy to the defense needs of the Nation." The SCRA temporarily suspends certain judicial and administrative proceedings and transactions that may adversely affect a person's legal rights during military service. It does not provide forgiveness of all debts or the extinguishment of contractual obligations on behalf of active-duty servicemember, nor does it grant absolute immunity from civil lawsuits. Instead, the SCRA provides for the suspension of claims and protection from default judgments against military personnel. In this way, it seeks to balance the interests of military personnel and their creditors, spreading the burden of national military service to a broader portion of the citizenry. Courts are to construe theSCRA liberally in favor of military families, but retain discretion to deny relief in certain cases. Many of the SCRC provisions are especially beneficial for Reservists activated to respond to a national crisis, but some provisions are also useful for career military personnel, including the cap on interest at an annual rate of 6% on debts incurred prior to entering active duty. Other measures protect military families from being evicted from rental or mortgaged property; from cancellation of life insurance; from taxation in multiple jurisdictions; from foreclosure of property to pay taxes that are due; and from losing certain rights to public land. This report provides a section-by-section summary of the SSCRA. It begins by providing a general definition of the term "servicemember," followed by a brief discussion of the provisions of Title I, Title II, Title III, and Title IV. The report then provides a brief overview of Title V, Title VI, Title VII, Title VIII, and Titles IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XI. Finally, the report provides an overview of the report's sections that pertain to the rights and protections available to individuals in military service and their dependents, as well as a discussion of some of the issues that may arise during the course of military service that may affect a family's ability to meet its financial obligations. The section on veterans' benefits is titled "Veterans' Benefits." This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33487, Veterans' Benefits: A Brief Overview, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10101, Military Benefits: An Overview of Selected Provisions of Title VII of the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 (Pursuant to P.L. 110-246, as amended).
The Second Chance Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Title V of the First Step Act) reauthorizes many of the grant programs that were initially authorized by the Second Chance Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-199). The act amends the authorization for the Adult and Juvenile State and Local Offender Demonstration Program so grants can be awarded to states, local governments, territories, or Indian tribes, or any combination thereof, in partnership with interested persons (including federal correctional officials), service providers, and nonprofit organizations, for the strategic planning and implementation of reentry programs. The act also reauthorized a BOP pilot program to provide early release to elderly prisoners. It also authorized appropriations for reentry-related research projects, including a study by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) identifying the number and characteristics of children with incarcerated parents and their likelihood of engaging in criminal activity. The Second Chance reauthorization act also authorized a grant program to evaluate and improve academic and vocational education in prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities, and required the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to develop policies for wardens of prisons and community-based facilities to enter into recidivism-reducing partnerships with nonprofit and other private organizations, including faith-based and community based organizations, to deliver recidivist reduction programming. In addition to correctional and sentencing reform, the act contained a series of other criminal justice-related provisions. These included a modification of the good time credit provision to allow prisoners to earn up to 54 days of good time credits for every year of their imposed sentence rather than for every years of their sentenced served; a requirement that BOP provide a secure storage area outside of the secure perimeter of a correctional institution for qualified law enforcement officers employed by BOP to store firearms; a prohibition on the use of restraints on pregnant inmates in BOP's custody; and a requirement to place prisoners with lower risk levels and lower needs on home confinement for the maximum amount of time permitted under the BOP Early Release Pilot Program for low-risk prisoners. This report provides a brief overview of the provisions contained in the act. The report also includes a discussion of some of the key provisions of the act, such as the reauthorizations of the Offender Reentry Substance Abuse and Criminal Justice Collaboration Program, the Community-based Mentoring and Transitional Service Grants to Nonprofit Organizations Program, and the National Prisoner Statistics Program. It will be updated as legislative activity warrants. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33487, The Second-Chamber Reform and Reentry of Federal Prisoners, by [author name scrubbed].
The Social Security program pays benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members and to the family members of deceased workers. As of March 2019, there were 63.3 million Social Security beneficiaries. Approximately 70% of those beneficiaries were retired workers and 13% were disabled workers. The remaining beneficiaries were the survivors of deceased insured workers or the spouses and children of retired ordisabled workers. Social Security is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by covered workers and employers. The program is also credited with federal income taxes paid on a portion of benefits paid by some beneficiaries, reimbursements from the General Fund of the Treasury for various purposes, and interest income from investments held by the Social Security trust funds. The Social Security Administration (SSA) and the U.S. Treasury are authorized to pay Social Security benefits in full and on time as long as there is an adequate balance in the social security trust funds (the designated accounts). When current Social Security revenues are not sufficient to pay benefits, however, the federal government must raise the funds necessary to honor the redemption of federal government obligations held in the trust funds as they are needed to pay the benefits scheduled under current law. In the past, Congress has authorized temporary interfund borrowing and payroll tax reallocations between the Old-Age, Survivors, and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) trust funds to address funding imbalances. This CRS report discusses the operations of the OASI and DI trust funds on a combined basis, referring to them collectively as the Social security trust fund. The report also provides a discussion of the current status of the DI trust fund, which is projected to have a balance of $2.9 trillion at the end of 2018 (a positive balance) and will have sufficient asset reserves to pay all scheduled benefits until 2035, at which point it will have a negative balance (a negative balance) of $1.0 trillion (a cash flow deficit). The report concludes by discussing the impact of the balance of the trust fund balance on the federal debt limit. This report will be updated as events warrant.

This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler shipbuilding program, a program to build a new class of 20 fleet oilers for the Navy. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the fifth and sixth ships in the program. Issues for Congress regarding the program include the following: whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the program; the number of oilers the Navy will require in coming years to support its operations; and whether to encourage or direct the Navy to build TAO- 205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned. Decisions that Congress makes on the program could affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the TAO -205 program and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues forCongress, by Ronald O'Rourke. This report will be updated as warranted by events.

Patents and regulatory exclusivities—two principal forms of intellectual property (IP) protection in pharmaceuticals—are generally distinct, but at times overlap and interact. Complicating matters further is the fact that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates pharmaceutical products differently depending on whether they derive from natural sources. In particular, before they can be marketed or sold, nonbiological "drugs" must be approved by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), whereas "biologics" must have been licensed under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Finally, patents on pharmaceutical drugs or biologics are subject to specialized patent dispute resolution procedures that can affect a manufacturer's ability to bring a follow-on product (i.e., a generic drug or biosimilar) to market. In light of these complexities, a fair amount of background is necessary to understand how IP rights are obtained in pharmaceutical products, how these rights may impact drug prices, and the various reforms that have been proposed in Congress to reduce drug prices for consumers. This report reviews patent law, including the requirements for obtaining a patent, the rights granted to patent holders, and various limitations on those rights. It also discusses FDA requirements for obtain approval to market a drug or biological product, the abbreviated pathways for generic drug approval under the Hatch-Waxman Act and biosimilar licensure under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), and different regulatory exclusivity that FDA grants to certain types of approved pharmaceutical products. Finally, this report describes and compares the different specialized patent disputes procedures for generic drugs and biosimilars under Hatch-waxman and the BPCIA, respectively. The report also reviews a number of legislative proposals in the 115th and 116th Congresses that seek to reduce pharmaceutical drug and biological product prices through reforming IP laws and/or facilitating increased competition from generic drug and biologic manufacturers. This review is not intended to be comprehensive, nor does it evaluate the merits of these proposals. Rather, proposals are reviewed merely as representative examples of the various types of legal changes under consideration. Related or similar proposals are referenced in the footnotes. As noted above, IP rights is only one factor that may contribute to consumer prices in a highly complex pharmaceutical market. Thus, congressional proposals related to IPrights are merely one potential means to reduce prescription drug prices that is currently under consideration in Congress. Other legislative proposals would, for example, permit the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate drug prices in Medicare Part D, allow consumers to import (often cheaper) pharmaceuticals from Canada under certain circumstances, or reform health insurance requirements to institute a cap on consumers' out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. Because these and other similar proposals relate only indirectly to IP rights in prescription drugs, they are outside the scope of this report. In part due to the complexity of the legal regimes governing IP rights, there are many different approaches that legislators seeking to reduce Drug and Biologic prices might take. These approaches include efforts to facilitate generic and Biosimilar market entry, curtail practices perceived to be anticompetitive, limit IP rights based on pricing behavior, and increase patent transparency.
This report provides background information and issues for Congress on three new ship-based weapons being developed by the Navy—solid state lasers (SSLs), the electromagnetic railgun (EMRG), and the gun-launched guided projectile (GLGP), also known as the hypervelocity projectile (HVP). Any one of these three new weapons, if successfully developed and deployed, might be regarded as a "game changer" for defending Navy surface ships against enemy missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Rarely has the Navy had so many potential new types of surface-ship air-defense weapons simultaneously available for development and potential deployment. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's acquisition strategies and funding requests for these three potential new weapons. Congress's decisions on this issue could affect future Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the defense industrial base. This report supersedes an earlier CRS report that provided an introduction to potential Navy shipboard lasers. The Navy in recent years has leveraged both significant advancements in industrial SSLs and decades of research and development work on military lasers done by other parts of the Department of Defense (DOD) to make substantial progress toward deploying high-energy SSLs on Navy ships. High-energySSLs would generally be short-range defensive weapons—they would generally counter targets at ranges of about one mile to perhaps eventually a few miles. In addition to a low marginal cost per shot and deep magazine, potential advantages of shipboard Laser Weapon Systems include fast engagement times, an ability to counter radically maneuvering missiles, a ability to conduct precision engagements, and the ability to use lasers for graduated responses ranging from detecting and monitoring targets to causing disabling damage. Potential limitations include line of sight; atmospheric absorption, scattering, and turbulence; an effect known as thermal blooming that can reduce laser effectiveness; countering saturation attacks; possible adversary use of hardened targets and countermeasures; and the risk of collateral damage, including damage to aircraft and satellites and permanent damage to human eyesight, including blinding. In recent years, the Navy has made considerable progress in developing SSLs, EMRG, and GLGP. However, a number of significant development challenges remain. Overcoming these challenges will likely require years of additional development work, and ultimate success in overcoming them is not guaranteed. In the near term, many challenges remain to develop and operate high- energy laser systems in the maritime environment that are unique to the Navy and Marine Corps. Among these challenges is dealing with the heat generated as power levels increase. A second issue is packing sufficient power on the platform, which will require advanced battery, generator, power conditioning, and hybrid energy technologies. Current laser technologies are approximately 30 percent electrically efficient. Corrosion and contamination of optical windows by shipboard salt spray, dirt, and grime also are technical challenges. Turbulence can cause the air over long distances to act like a lens, resulting in the laser beam's diffusing and distorting, which degrades its performance. Laser proponents acknowledge the record of past unfulfilled predictions, but argue that the situation has now changed because of rapid advancements in SSL technology and a shift from earlier ambitious goals (such as developing megawatt-power lasers for countering targets at tens or hundreds of miles) to more realistic goals (e.g., developing kilowatt- power lasers for attacking targets at no more than few miles). Laser proponents might argue that laser skeptics are vulnerable to what might be called cold plate syndrome (i.e., a cat that sits on a hot plate will not sit on ahot plate again—but it will not sitting on a cold plate, either).
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is rich in minerals, forest resources, freshwater, and agricultural potential, but most Congolese live in poverty. It is also home to one of the world's poorest countries, with per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) and human development indicators among the lowest in the world. In recent years, DRC has been beset by civil war, political instability, and humanitarian crises that have displaced millions of people and contributed to an estimated 3.3 million deaths. In December 2018, the United States welcomed opposition figure Felix Tshisekedi's victory in DRC's December 2018 presidential election, applauding theCongolese people "for their insistence on a peaceful and democratic transfer of power." Election day was indeed largely peaceful, and alternate scenarios that outgoing President Joseph Kabila might have preferred (e.g., his own reelection or the election of his chosen successor, former Interior Minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary) ultimately did not materialize. Whether the election was "democratic" is debatable, however, as is the degree to which Tshidkei's presidency represents a "transfer of power" Former President Kabila—whose decision to cling to power past the end of his two constitutionally permitted terms in 2016 sparked a national political crisis and widespread protests—appears poised to retain significant political influence. Kabila, who first assumed the presidency in 2000, now holds the title of "Senator-for-Life," while his Common Front for Congo (FCC) coalition won sweeping majorities in parliament and provincial assemblies, and in subsequent indirect elections for the Senate and provincial governors. Tshiskeldi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) won very few sub-national contests, and it has agreed to form a coalition government with the FCC. The challenges facing DRC are stark. Security threats, political uncertainty, "endemic corruption," poor infrastructure, and unpredictable regulatory enforcement have contributed to a poor business climate. Enduring conflicts and humanitarian suffering in the east both reflect and contribute to regional instability. In April 2019, the Islamic State (IS, a.k.a. ISIS/ISIL) organization claimed an attack on local security forces in eastern DRC. This appeared to be the latest in a series of developments linking the group to a nebulous locally based armed group known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), although the extent of ties is subject to debate. U.S. Policy The Trump Administration welcomed the 2018 election results and has pledged to work with the new president, while strongly criticizing the process that delivered him the presidency. The Administration's broad emphasis on encouraging trade and investment ties while countering "great power competitors" in Africa may contribute to its interest in establishing a positive relationship with Tshiekedi. The United States has sought to promote stability, economic growth, health, good governance, education, security force professionalization, military justice, and military justice through bilateral and multilateral assistance to DRC, as well as through U.N. peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance. In the 115th Congress, attention toward DRC focused on deterring DRC from clinging to power. H.R. 6207, which passed the House, would have codified the U. S. sanctions framework for DRC (currently imposed under Executive Orders) and potentially compelled additional designations. The Senate agreed to S.Res. 485, which would have required the Secretary of State to certify that the government of DRC is not engaged in "destabilizing activities" in a neighboring country, among other provisions. In addition, the Senate passed resolutions (S. resolution) calling for punitive measures against those responsible for abusing human rights or undermining democracy. Congress also enacted legislation (P.L. 114-231, Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016) to address the illegal trade in endangered and threatened wildlife. Congress has also imposed restrictions on certain types of aid for countries that use child soldiers, have a poor record on human trafficking, or are involved in the trade in "conflict minerals." For the past decade, Congress has placed conditions on military aid to neighboring countries—at times specifically targeting Rwanda and/or Uganda—in order to deter proxy involvement in conflicts in D Congo. Most recently, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, restricts International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds for any government in Africa
Iran's nuclear program began during the 1950s. Construction of a U.S.-supplied research reactor, called the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), located in Tehran, began in 1960; the reactor went critical in 1967. During the 1970s, Tehran pursued an ambitious nuclear power program. Iran wanted to construct 10-20 nuclear power reactors and produce more than 20,000 megawatts of nuclear power by 1994. Iran also began constructing a light-water nuclear power reactor near the city of Bushehr, and it considered obtaining uranium enrichment and reprocessing technology. Although Iran cancelled its nuclear program after its 1979 revolution, a 1981 Department of State draft paper argued that Iran might develop a nuclear weapons program in response to a then-suspected Iraqi weapons program, although Iran was not one of several countries of "near to medium term proliferation concern" cited in the paper. Tehran "reinstituted" its nuclear programs in 1982. According to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports, Iran conducted experiments during the 1980s and early 1990s related to uranium conversion, heavy-water production, and nuclear reactor fuel fabrication. A 1985 National Intelligence Council report, which cited Iran as a potential "proliferation threat," stated that Tehran was "interested in developing facilities that ... could eventually produce fissile material that could be used in a [nuclear] weapon." The report, however, added that it "would take at least a decade" for Iran to do so. More recently, the Iranian government has said that it plans to expand its reliance on nuclear power to generate electricity. This program will, Tehran says, reduce Iran's oil and gas consumption and allow the country to export additional fossil fuels; the previous Iranian regime also made this argument. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) requires Iran to refrain from building heavy- water-moderated reactors for 15 years. Pursuant to the agreement, Iran has pledged to refrain to constructing any such reactors indefinitely. Iranian officials say that Tehran has begun design work on its first indigenously produced light- water reactor, to be constructed at Darkhovin. Iran has also begun to operate the BusheHR reactor, and Tehran says it intends to build additional reactors to generate 20,00 megawatt of power within the next 20 years. The JCPOA also commits Tehran to redesign and rebuild the Arak reactor based on a design agreed to by the P5+1. Tehran has stated that it will not produce weapons-grade plutonium from the spent nuclear fuel in these reactors. The agreement also prohibits Iran from enriching uranium enriched to more than 5% uranium-235 at its Fordow enrichment facility and from producing uranium hexafluoride (U.S. nuclear-grade material) at its Natanz enrichment facility. Iran is also prohibited from producing or acquiring plutonium or uranium metals or their alloys and from conducting research and development on plutonium and uranium metallurgy and machining uranium or plutonium metals. The United States and other governments have asserted that Iran may be pursuing, at a minimum, the capability to produce nuclear weapons. However, Iranian officials have repeatedly asserted that the country is not pursuing nuclear weapons and that the nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes. The IAEA has concluded that Iran's nuclear weapons-related activities "took place under a structured programme," but senior Iranian officials ordered a halt to the program in late 2003. The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution in February 2006 that referred Iran's case to the Security Council for the first time, but did not refer Iran to the council. In June 2006, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, collectively known as the "P5 plus1," presented a proposal to Iran that offered a variety of incentives in return for Tehran taking several steps to assuage international concerns about its enrichment and heavy water programs. In November 2013, Iran and the P 5+1 agreed to an accord called the Joint Plan of action (JPA) that set out an approach toward reaching a long-term comprehensive solution to international concerns regarding Iran's uranium enrichment program. The two sides began implementing the JPA on January 20, 2014, and Iran signed the agreement on November 24, 2014. In May 2018, President Trump announced that he would reimpose sanctions on Iran in two tranches: the first in May 2018 and the second in November 2018. The
In the 110th Congress (2007-2008), the House created the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) to review complaints, and when appropriate, refer findings of fact to the Committee on Ethics. The OCE is the first independent, outside body charged by Congress to investigate complaints against Members, officers, and employees of the House of Representatives and to refer valid complaints to the committee for further investigation and possible discipline. In January 2009, the OCE was reauthorized as part of H.Res. 895 (110th Congress). This report provides a brief overview of the structure, powers, authority, and procedures of the new OCE. It also provides an overview of legislative proposals to create an independent ethics commission, an office of public integrity, or a public review board or office within the legislative branch, composed of former Members of Congress, retired judges, private citizens, or some combination of these. This report will be updated as events warrant. For additional information on the House ethics process, see CRS Report RL33487, House of Representative: Overview of the Ethics Process, by [author name scrubbed]. This report focuses only on House ethics issues. It does not address Senate or other federal ethics issues, such as conflict of interest, bribery, or campaign finance laws. Since the first session of Congress in 1789, the House and the Senate have contemplated how to judge fellow Members. In 1964, the Senate established the Select Committee on ethics, and in 1967, in the House, the committee on Standards of Official Conduct was created. These two committees formally assumed the duties of investigating allegations of wrongdoing against Members of their respective chambers. Historically, Congress has used its ethics power neither arbitrarily nor frequently. Congress has, however, "periodically tightened its ethics codes and procedures for dealing with misconduct." In addition to amending internal congressional ethics code and procedures, Congress also has considered numerous legislative proposals since 1951 to create a separate, independent ethics advisory body that would replace or assist the committee with investigations or enforcement. In the 82nd Congress (1951-1952), the Special Subcommittee on the Establishment of a Commission on Ethics in Government held hearings on the creation of a congressional commission to "strengthen the faith and confidence of the American people in their Government by assisting in the establishment of higher moral standards in the official conduct of the executive and legislative branches of the Government." In 1993, the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress held hearings to examine the congressional ethics process. The committee's final report summarized the differing opinions of witnesses on the role of an independent entity and its ramifications on Congress: While no witnesses advocated giving the entire responsibility to a group of outsiders, some wanted non-members to be able to investigate charges and recommend punishment. Conversely, other witnesses wanted ethics proceedings to be conducted only by members. In December 2007, the Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement (Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader John Boehner) issued its final report. The task force recommended the creation and operation of a six-member entity to investigate possible violations of House rules. In coordination with the release of the task force members' report, Representative Capuano introduced a bill (H.Res., 895) in December 2007 that would have created an independent OCE to investigate allegations of misconduct by House Members and staff. On March 10, 2008, the Rules Committee reported H. Res. 1031, which provided for the adoption of the resolution, as amended, under a closed, self-executing rule. The Committee on Rules report included amendments to the resolution that were to be considered as adopted. The amendments made 13 changes to the original text of the measure. The House debated and agreed to the measure on March 11, 2008. In March 2009, Representative Ron Paul introduced a resolution to amend House Rules to allow citizens to petition the board of the Officeof Congressional Ethics to investigate potential violations of the rule of conduct. The resolution, if agreed to, would have added to the O CE's jurisdiction by amending House rules to include the ability to take complaints from the general public. In addition, the resolution would have established a process for the public to submit information to the board for review and referral to the Ethics Committee. In 2009, H.R. 5, which was adopted by the House in the 115th Congress, created a new office of Congressional Complaint Review within the House Ethics Committee to investigate and recommend discipline for violations of chamber rules. This new office, which has jurisdiction only over
This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program—the Coast Guard's program for acquiring new polar icebreakers. The PSC program has received a total of $1,034.6 million (i.e., about $1.0 billion) in procurement funding through FY2019. The Coast Guard has requested $35 million for the program in its proposed FY2020 budget, which is enough to cover FY2020 program-management costs. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Administration's FY2020 procurement funding request for the PSC Program, and, more generally, whether to approved, rejected, or modified the Coast Guard'S overall plan for procuring new polarIcebreakers. Congress's decisions on this issue could affect Coast Guard funding requirements, Coast Guard ability to perform its polar missions, and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base. A separate CRS report covers acquisition of general-purpose cutters for the Coast Coast Guard. Polar icebreakers are large cutters that perform missions in both the Arctic and the Antarctic. The permanent statute that sets forth the Coastguard's primary duties—14 U. S.C. 102—states that among other things, the CoastGuard shall (emphasis added) "develop, establish, maintain, and operate, with due regard to the requirements of national defense, aids to maritime navigation, icebreaking facilities, and rescue facilities for the promotion of safety on, under, and over the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States," and "pursuant to international agreements, develop, establish and maintain, maintain and operate icebreaking Facilities on,under, andover waters other than the high Seas and waterssubject to the jurisdictions of theUnited States...." The roles of polar icebreaker cutters can be summarized as follows: (1) conducting and supporting scientific research in the Arctic; (2) supporting National Science Foundation (NSF) research activities in both polar regions; (3) helping to maintain a U.s. presence in the polar regions by monitoring sea traffic; and (4) conducting other typical Coast Guard missions (such as search and rescue, law enforcement, and protection of marine resources) in Arctic waters, including north of Alaska. The polar icebreaking mission generally poses the greatest icebreaking challenge for U. s. polar icelers, though Arctic ice can frequently pose its own significant icebreaking challenges. The U.N.'s International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have concluded that the UnitedStates needs two new heavy icebreakers and three medium icebreakers to meet its Arctic and Antarctic missions. The National Research Council (NRC) concluded in a 2007 study that a fleet of three multimission and one single-mission icebreakers is needed to meet the nation's future icebreaking needs. In a 2010 report, the National Arctic Research Commission (USARC) urged the President and Congress to invest in two new icebreakers for Arctic research purposes. A congressionally mandated July 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report on acquisition and operation of icebreakers concluded that building a single medium icebreaker to the same common design as three new heavy polar ice breakers would result in ships that would not be too different in size from the three current heavy icebreaker ships and would reduce the cost of developing a new design by making the medium icebreaking the fourth ship on an existing learning curve rather than the first ship on a new production learning curve. The FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 2810/P.L. 115-91 of December 12, 2017) authorizes the acquisition of one polar-class "heavy icebreaker vessel" and authorizes funding for that procurement through the Navy's Shipbuilding and Conversion Navy (SCN) appropriation account (which is part of the Department of Defense's (DOD's) budget). The FY2019 DHS Appropriations Act (Division A of H.J.Res. 31 of February 15, 2019) provided an additional $675 million for this program, including $20 million for procurement of long leadtime materials (LLTM) for the second PSC in the program. The first PSC is scheduled to begin construction in 2021 and be delivered in 2024, though the DD&C contract includes financial incentives for earlier delivery.
The last several years have seen renewed debate over the role that race plays in higher education—a debate over "affirmative action." A high-profile lawsuit challenging Harvard University's consideration of race in admitting its incoming classes, and the recent withdrawal of Obama Administration-era guidance addressing similar race-conscious policies, have focused the debate on " Affirmative Action" in perhaps its more familiar sense: the voluntary consideration of student applicants' race as a way of increasing the participation of racial minorities in higherEducation. Meanwhile, a recent lawsuit involving Maryland's university system has brought renewed attention to "Affirmativeaction" in its other, original sense—the mandatory use of race by public higher education systems to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. The Supreme Court has made clear that a state that had a segregated system of education must eliminate all "vestiges" of that system, including through expresslyrace-conscious remedies. In its consequential 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, the Court charted a three-step inquiry for assessing whether a state has fulfilled that constitutional obligation, examining whether a current policy is traceable to the de jure segregated system, has continued discriminatory effect, and can be modified or practicably eliminated consistent with sound educational policy. Outside this de jurisdiction context, "affirmed action" has come to refer to a different category of race- conscious policies. These involve what the Court once called the "benign" use of racial classifications—voluntary measures designed not directly to remedy past governmental discrimination, but to increase the representation of racial minority previously excluded from various societal institutions. And in the context of higher education the Court has addressed one type of policy in particular: the use ofrace as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice now observed by many public and private colleges and universities. The federal courts have so far upheld those policies under a single theory: that the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body uniquely justify some consideration ofrace when deciding how to assemble an incoming class. To rely on that diversity rationale, however, the Supreme Court now requires universities to articulate in concrete and precise terms what their diversity-related goals are, and why they have chosen those goals in particular. And even once those goals are established, a university must still show that its admissions policy achieves its diversity- related goals as precisely as possible, while ultimately "treat[ing] each applicant as an individual." Because both lines of cases discussed here have their roots in the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, this report focuses primarily on public universities, all of which are directly subject to constitutional requirements. But those same requirements apply equally to private universities that receive federal funds pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI or the Act), which similarly prohibits recipients of federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of race. This report concludes by discussing the role of Title VI in ensuring equal protection in higher Education, both private and public, including several avenues for congressional action under the Act.

Nigeria has overtaken South Africa as Africa's largest economy and is one of the world's major sources of high-quality crude oil. It also has the fastest-growing population globally, which is forecast to reach 410 million by 2050 and overtake the United States to become the third-most populous country. The country is home to more than 250 ethnic groups, but the northern Hausa and Fulani, the southwestern Yoruba, and the southeastern Igbo have traditionally been the most politically active and dominant. Roughly half the population, primarily residing in the north, is Muslim. Southern Nigeria is predominantly Christian, and Nigeria's Middle Belt (which spans the country's central zone) is a diverse mix. Ethnic and religious strife have been common in Nigeria. Tens of thousands of Nigerians have been killed in sectarian and intercommunal clashes in the past two decades. Ethnic, regional, and sectarian divisions often stem from issues related to access to land, jobs, and socioeconomic development, and are sometimes fueled by politicians. The violent Islamist group Boko Haram has contributed to a major deterioration of security conditions in the northeast since 2009. It espouses a Salafist interpretation of Islam and seeks to capitalize on local frustrations, discredit the government, and establish an Islamic state in the region. Boko Haram's 2015 pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State raised its profile and may have provided recruitment and fundraising opportunities, though the extent to which affiliation has facilitated operational ties remains unclear. In 2016, Boko Haram splintered into two groups, one led by self-declared Islamic State-West Africa (IS-WA) leader Abu Musab al-Barnawi and the other led by Abubakar Shekau. IS-WA has reportedly focused its attacks primarily on security force and government targets on both sides of the Nigeria-Niger border, mainly operating in Nigeria's Borno state, where both groups appear most active. The U.S. Department of Defense has estimated IS- WA to have approximately 3,500 fighters and Boko Haram to have roughly 1,500. Nigeria's 2015 elections were its most competitive contest to date and were viewed as a critical test for its leaders, security forces, and people. They were widely hailed as historic, with President Goodluck Jonathan and the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) losing to a new opposition coalition led by former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari. Jonathan was Nigeria's first incumbent president to lose an election. Buharian's All Progressives Congress (APC) capitalized on popular frustration with rising insecurity, mounting economic pressures, and allegations of large-scale state corruption to win a majority in the legislature and a majority of state elections. Decreased turnout for the PDP appeared to be partly linked to broad discontent with the government's response to the Boko Haram threat, in particular the April 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls from the northeast town of Chibok and the group's subsequent territorial advances. The Nigerian government has struggled to counter Boko Haram, which has abducted hundreds of civilians since 2014 and has used women and children as suicide bombers since 2014. The group has also carried out a series of devastating attacks against Nigerian military bases in 2018, including a spate of raids in late 2018 that reportedly killed more than 100 soldiers. The State Department designated both Boko Haram and IS-Worthing West Africa as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) in 2013 and as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The FTO designations aim to assist law enforcement agencies in efforts to investigate and prosecute suspects associated with the group. The United States is Nigeria's largest bilateral donor, providing an average of over $450 million annually to strengthen democratic governance, broaden economic growth, and improve access to education, health care, and other social services. Nigeria is a focus country under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and Malaria Initiative (PMI), and Nigerian farmers benefit from agriculture programs under the Feed the Future (FTF) initiative that focus on building partnerships with the private sector to expand exports and generate employment. Interventions to encourage private sector participation in trade and energy are also key components of economic growth initiatives in Nigeria, including efforts to reform the petroleum and power sectors. The government has sought to shift spending toward capital investment and expand the social safety net, seeking to stimulate the ailing economy through increased public expenditure.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is an agency within the Department of Defense with both military and civil works responsibilities. The agency's civil works mission has evolved with the changing needs of the nation. It began with improving and regulating navigation channels thereby facilitating the movement of goods between states and for import and export. More recently, Congress has authorized the agency to restore aquatic ecosystems. USACE operates more than 700 dams; has built 14,500 miles of levees; and improves and maintains more than 900 coastal, Great Lakes, and inland harbors, as well as 12,000 miles of inland waterways. Congress directs and oversees the specific navigation, flood control, and ecosystem restoration projects that USACE plans and constructs through authorization legislation, annual and supplemental appropriations legislation, and oversight efforts. Unlike with federal funding for highways and municipal water infrastructure, the majority of federal funds provided to USACE for water resource projects are not distributed by formula to states or through competitive grant programs. Instead, USACE is directly engaged in the planning and construction of projects, and the agency typically is working with nonfederal project sponsors in the development of these projects. The demand for USACE projects typically exceeds the federal appropriations for these projects and, as a result, Congress is faced with considering how well the nation is addressing its water resource needs and what is the current and future role of USACE in addressing those needs. Part of the issue is how effective, efficient, and equitable is the USACE project delivery process in meeting the nation's needs. In recent years, the agency's aging infrastructure and efforts to enhance the security of its infrastructure from terrorism and natural threats have expanded USACE activities in infrastructure rehabilitation, maintenance, and protection. The federal share of costs for most USACE water resource activities has increased in recent years. Congress has increased the flexibility in project delivery by authorizing and extending alternative ways to advance and deliver USACE studies and projects. Congress also has authorized new projects, increased authorized funding levels, and modified existing projects through annual appropriations legislation. The 115th Congress enacted America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA 2018, P.L. 115-270) in October 2018. AWIA 2018 includes the Water Resources Development Act of2018 (WRDA 2018) as Title I of the bill. WRDA 2018 authorized new studies and construction projects. In June 2018, the Trump Administration proposed to move USACE civil works activities from the department of Defense to other federal agencies to consolidate and align USACE missions with these agencies. The Trump Administration has not provided additional details on its June 2018 reorganization proposal in subsequent public documents. The 116th Congress may consider WRDA legislation. These deliberations are likely to be shaped by many factors, such as policy proposals by the President, congressional policies on earmarks, and development of an infrastructure initiative or other actions or developments that may alter the framework and context for federal and non-federal investments. Congress may also be presented with various reports to inform its WRDA deliberations.
The minority leader of the modern House is the head of the "loyal opposition." As the minority party's nominee for Speaker at the start of a new Congress, the minority leader traditionally hands the gavel to the Speaker-elect, who is usually elected on a straight party-line vote. The minority leader is elected every two years by secret ballot of his or her party caucus or conference. These party leaders are typically experienced lawmakers when they win election to this position. While the position itself is usually occupied by Members with significant House experience, the roles and responsibilities of the majority leader and minority leader are not well-defined. To a large extent, the position of minority leader in the contemporary Congress is a late-19th-century innovation. Prior to this time congressional parties were often relatively disorganized, so it was not always evident who functioned as the opposition floor leader. Decades went by before anything like our modern two-party congressional system emerged on Capitol Hill with official titles for those who were selected as party leaders. However, from the beginning days of Congress, various House Members intermittently assumed the role of "opposition leader." Some scholars suggest that Representative James Madison of Virginia informally functioned in the First Congress as the first "minority leader" because in that Congress he led the opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's fiscal policies. During this early period, it was common for neither major party grouping (Federalists and Republicans) to have an official leader. In 1813, for instance, a scholar recounts that the Federalist minority of 36 Members needed a committee of 13 "to represent a party comprising a distinct minority" and "to coordinate the actions of men who were already partisans in the same cause." In 1828, a foreign observer of the House offered this perspective on the absence of formal party leadership in the House: "I found there were absolutely no persons holding the stations of what are called, in England, Leaders, on either side of theHouse.... " The position of House minority leader was established officially as a party position during the latter part of the 19th century. Although congressional historians disagree as to the exact time period when the minority leadership emerged officially as an official party position, it seems safe to conclude that the position was established during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the legislative agenda, partisan ratios on committees, staff resources, administrative operations, and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities. This report will be updated as events warrant.
Strong relations between the United States and Israel have led to bilateral cooperation in many areas. Matters of particular significance include the following: Shared U.S.-Israel concerns about Iran, within the context of the 2015 international nuclear agreement, and growing tension involving Iran and Hezbollah at Israel's northern border with Syria and Lebanon. Israeli-Palestinian issues, including those involving Jerusalem, Hamas and the Gaza Strip, funding for Palestinians, and a possible Trump Administration peace plan. Israeli domestic political issues, such as probable corruption-related indictments against Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and closely contested elections that are scheduled for April 9, 2019. Israeli national elections and the subsequent government formation process will have significant implications for the country's leadership and future policies. Israel relies on a number of strengths to manage potential threats to its security and existence. These strengths include robust military and homeland security capabilities, as well as close cooperation with theUnited States. Israel maintains conventional military superiority relative to its neighbors and the Palestinians. Shifts in regional order and evolving asymmetric threats during this decade have led Israel to update its efforts to project military strength, deter attack, and defend its population and borders. Israel appears to have reduced some unconventional threats via missile defense systems, reported cyber defense and warfare capabilities, and other heightened security measures. Israel has a robust homeland security system featuring sophisticated early warning practices and thorough border and airport security controls. Israel is not a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and maintains a policy of "nuclear opacity" or amimut. The United States has countenanced Israel's nuclear ambiguity since 1969, when Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and President Richard Nixon reportedly reached an accord whereby both sides agreed never to acknowledge Israel'snuclear arsenal in public. A 2017 report estimated that Israel possesses a nuclear arsenal of around 80-85 warheads. Israel might have nuclear weapons deployable via aircraft, submarine, and ground-based missiles. No other Middle Eastern country is generally thought to possess nuclear weapons. Israeli officials closely consult with U. S. counterparts in an effort to influence U.s. decisionmaking on key regional issues, and U.N. law requires the executive branch to take certain actions to preserve Israel's "qualitative military edge," or QME. Israel's leaders and supporters routinely make the case that Israel's security and the broader stability of the region remain critically important for U.L. interests. Iran remains of primary concern to Israeli officials largely because of Iran's antipathy toward Israel, Iran's broad regional influence, and the probability that some constraints on Iran's nuclear program could loosen in the future. In recent years, Israel and Arab Gulf states have discreetly cultivated closer relations with one another in efforts to counter Iran. Israel and Iran have engaged in hostile action over Iran's presence in Syria. In the early years of the Syria conflict, Israel primarily employed air strikes to prevent Iranian weapons shipments destined for the Iran-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Later, as the Syrian government regained control of large portions of the country with Iranian backing, Israeli leaders began pledging to prevent Iran from constructing and operating bases or advanced weapons manufacturing facilities. Since 2018, Israeli and Iranian forces have repeatedly targeted oneAnother in and over Syrian- and Israeli-controlled areas. In January 2019, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Israel had targeted Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria "hundreds of times." However, limited Israeli strikes to enforce "redlines" against Iranian-backed forces could expand into wider conflict, particularly if there is a miscalculation by one or both sides. President Trump has expressed interest in brokering a final-status agreement with the Palestinians, but the Administration has repeatedly postponed releasing a peace plan to facilitate negotiations. The Administration's recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move its embassy there has fed tensions between the Palestinians and Israel. The Trump Administration has also cut off funding for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and there are reports that the Administration is seeking temporary financial support from the private sector.
The federal crop insurance program provides farmers with risk management tools to cope with yield and price declines. Under the program, farmers can purchase subsidized policies that pay indemnities when their production or revenue falls below a producer-selected coverage level. The program is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. §1501 et seq.). The USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) regulates the program and funds it. Congress first authorized the program in 1938 in an effort to mitigate the effects on farmers of the Great Depression and of the crop losses seen in the Dust Bowl. In 1938, the FederalCrop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) was created to carry out the program. During the same era, farm programs were established to support crop prices and boost farm income for producers of so-called program crops, including wheat, corn, and cotton. Today, many banks, when making operating loans, require that farmers purchase crop insurance. In addition, the private sector has developed new products that would help farmers manage their risks. These products include crop insurance policies for specialty crops, such as fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, nuts, and nursery crops, as well as for other crops that are not covered by the program (e.g., honey, honeydews, honeycomb). In crop year 2015, nearly 300 million acres of specialty crops were covered by federal crop policies. Of those acres, about 8.1 million acres (3%) were specialty crops. For the 38 specialty crop categories for which federal insurance policies are measured by acreage (as opposed to bee colonies, tons, trees, or plant inventory value), the average participation rate was about 76% of eligible acres in 2015. Market penetration often varies widely by crop. For fruits and trees nuts, the share of federally insured acres ranges from less than 1% (strawberries) to more than 80% (citrus and plums/prunes). For vegetables and melons, insured acres range from 5% of total acres (fresh beans and sweet potatoes) to over 80%. Insured acreage as a share of crop acreage is relatively high in major specialty crop states, including California, Florida, and Washington. In 2017, the average premium subsidy for specialty crop policies was 64%, which was about 1% higher than the average subsidy for the entire crop insurance portfolio. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) required RMA to provide a Whole Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) policy option to agricultural producers and authorized higher premium subsidy levels for whole-farm policies than for other policy types. WFRP is available in all counties nationwide—either as a stand-alone policy or in combination with other policies—to farms with up to $10 million in insured revenue at the 85% coverage level and $17 million at the 50% coverage levels. W FRP does not offer crop-specific coverage (high deductible, 100% premium subsidy) and cannot be combined with traditional crop insurance (CAT-level) policies. In crop years 2015 through 2017, specialty crop premiums were about $18.5 billion. Premium subsidies across all commodities (not shown in the table) totaled $6.4 billion (63%) in crop year 2017, whereas premium subsidies for specialty crops totaled $701 million (64%). In addition to premiums, the federal government subsidizes the cost of premiums paid by the producer. Producer-paid premiums are the difference between total premium and premium subsidies. The federal government has historically supported specialty crops indirectly through research and marketing grants. It provides direct assistance to individual specialty crop farmers via federal crop Insurance and supplemental disaster assistance.
First enacted in 1965, the Older Americans Act (OAA, P.L. 89-73, as amended) is the primary federal vehicle for the delivery of social and nutrition services for older persons. The majority of OAA grant funds are provided to states and other entities based on statutory formulas that exist in the following titles: Title III, Grants for State and Community Programs on Aging; Title V, Community Service Employment for Older Americans; Title VI, grants for Older Native Americans; and Title VII, Vulnerable Elder Rights Protection Activities. These formula grants fund programs that assist older Americans with supportive services in their homes; congregate nutrition services (meals served at group sites such as senior centers, community centers, schools, churches, or senior housing complexes); home-delivered nutrition services; family caregiver support; community service employment; the long-term care ombudsman program; and services to prevent the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older Persons. The OAA also supports grants to older Native Americans for nutrition and supportive services. Since enactment of the OAA, Congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times. Most recently, in 2016, Congress reauthorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019, and made other changes to the act, including changes to four Title III programs that receive funding under statutory formulas. This report provides a brief overview of the statutory funding formula for these Title III grant programs, including a legislative history of the Title III funding formula and a discussion of the funding formula changes made by Congress in the reauthorizations of 2000, 2006, and 2016. The report also provides an analysis of the FY2016 allotment amounts for these programs for states and U.S. territories and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa, as well as FY2017 and FY2019 allotments for Guam, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, and the American Samoa and American Mariana Island territories. Appendix A of the report describes the legislative history and debate surrounding changes to Title III during the past three OAA reauthorization efforts. Appendix B provides the state-based population data for the population age 60 and older for each of the six programs authorized under Title III. Appendix C compares FY2016 funding amounts for states with actual allotments under the statutory formula changes in P. l. 114-144 for FY2016 to FY2019 for Title III Parts B, C, C1, C2, D, and D. Appendix D provides a comparison of FY2017 allotments to allotments in FY2018 and FY2018 for Title IV, D1, E, F, F2, G, H, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, and H9.
The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) was established by the National Housing Act of 1934 and became part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1965. It insures private lenders against losses on certain home mortgages. FHA insurance is intended to encourage lenders to offer mortgages to some borrowers who otherwise might be unable to access mortgage credit at affordable interest rates or at all. For example, FHA requires a smaller down payment than many other types of mortgages, potentially making it easier for lower-wealth borrowers, first-time homebuyers, or others for whom a large down payment may present a barrier to homeownership to obtain a mortgage. Most single-family mortgages insured by FHA are financed through an insurance fund called the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). Since FY2009, the MMI Fund has included FHA-insured reverse mortgages as well as traditional "forward" home mortgages, which are mortgages that are made to borrowers who already have a mortgage but who are seeking to access their accumulated home equity. In FY2018, the total dollar volume of mortgages that FHA insured was $1.3 trillion, and the capital ratio for the fund was estimated to be 2.76%. The capital ratio is a measure of how much capital the fund has on hand to cover expected future losses on the mortgages that it currently insures. The MMI fund's capital ratio fell below the required 2% threshold in FY2009 and then turned negative for a period of time in FY2012 and FY2013, before returning to a positive capital ratio in FY2014 and a positive one in FY2015. Since then, it has remained above 2% in each subsequent year to date in FY2018. In the years following the housing market turmoil that began around 2007, the credit subsidy rate re-estimates showed aggregate increases in expected losses on insured loans, requiring large transfers of funds from the Capital Reserve Account to the Financing Account to cover these additional expected losses. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) includes permanent and indefinite budget authority for federal loan guarantee programs to cover the cost of credit subsidy rates. Therefore, if FHA ever needs to transfer more money than it has in the capital reserve account to cover an increase in expected loss levels, it can draw on its permanent budget authority to receive funds from Treasury to make this transfer without additional congressional action. The amount of money that is needed to make the required transfer is based on the credit subsidies that it earned on loans that it insured in FY2013. However, due to reduced loan volumes in FY 2013, the fund earned less than anticipated during the year. At the end of September 2013, HUD announced that it needed about $ 1.7 billion to ensure that enough money was available in the Fin financing account to meet expected future loss levels. It received these funds using the permanent and indefinitely budget authority provided under the FCRA, and has not needed to draw on these funds since that time. Separately from the annual budget process, HUD is required by law to obtain an independent actuarial review each year that analyzes the financial position of the M MI Fund and to provide an annual report to Congress on the results of the actuarial reviews. The results of this review are presented in FHA's annual report, which was released in November 2018. This report describes the financial status of the fund and provides an overview of some of the major factors that affect the fund's financial soundness. It also discusses selected current issues that are often discussed in the context of the review, such as the inclusion of reverse mortgages in the fund, debate over the appropriate level for the mortgage insurance premiums charged, and certain trends in mortgage characteristics that are worthy of monitoring. It will be updated as warranted.
The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that "[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury." This provision requires that a federal prosecutor, in order to charge a suspect with a serious federal crime, secure the assent of an independent investigative and deliberative body comprising citizens drawn from the jurisdiction in which the crime would be tried. Federal grand juries serve two primary functions: (1) they aid federal prosecutors in investigating possible crimes by issuing subpoenas for documents, physical evidence, and witness testimony; and (2) they determine whether there is sufficient evidence to charges a criminal suspect with the crime or crimes under investigation. Traditionally, the grand jury has done its work in secret. Secrecy prevents those under scrutiny from fleeing or importuning the grand jurors, encourages full disclosure by witnesses, and protects the innocent from unwarranted prosecution, among other things. The long-established rule of grand jury secrecy is enshrined in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which provides that government attorneys and the jurors themselves, among others, "must not disclose a matter occurring before thegrand jury." Accordingly, as a general matter, persons and entities external to the grand Jury process are precluded from obtaining transcripts of grand Jury testimony or other documents or information that would reveal "what took place" in the proceedings, even if the grand juror has concluded its work and even if information is sought pursuant to otherwise-valid legal processes. At times, the rule ofgrand jury secrecy has come into tension with Congress's power of inquiry when an arm of the legislative branch has sought protected materials pursuant to its oversight function. For example, some courts have determined that the information barrier established in Rule 6(i) extends to congressional inquiries, noting that the Rule "contains no reservations in favor of . . . congressional access to grand jury materials" that would otherwise remain secret. Nevertheless, the Rule is subject to a number of exceptions, both codified and judicially crafted, that permit grand jury information to be disclosed in certain circumstances (usually only with prior judicial authorization). In addition, courts have recognized that documents and information are not independently insulated from disclosure merely because they happen to have been presented to, or considered by, a grand jury. As such, although the Rule generally limits congressional access, Congress has several tools at its disposal to seek materials connected to a federal grand jury investigation. This report begins with an overview of the standards governing—and exceptions applicable to—grand Jury secrecy under Federal Rule 6 (e). The report also addresses whether and how the Rule and its exceptions apply to Congress, including the circumstances under which Congress may obtain grand Jury information and what restrictions apply to further disclosures. Concluding this report is a discussion of past legislative efforts to amend the Rule to provide congressional committees with access togrand jury materials.
This report provides both an overview of the FY2019 defense appropriations act (P.L. 115-245) and access to other CRS products providing additional detail and analysis on particular issues and programs dealt with by that law. For FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $668.4 billion to fund programs falling within the scope of the annual defense appropriations bill. This included $67.9 billion to be designated by Congress and the President as funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and $599.4 million for DOD's base budget, comprising all operations not designated as OCO. The Administration's request for the bill was consistent with the $600-billion cap on discretionary spending in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, which applies to defense-related spending in other agencies as well as to DOD. The FY2019 DOD request continued an upswing in spending that began with the FY2016 budget, which marked the end of a relatively steady decline in real (that is, inflation-adjusted) DOD purchasing power. Measured in constant dollars, DOD funding peaked in FY2010, after which the drawdown of U.S. troops in OCO operations drove a reduction in DOD spending. The House-passed version of the bill would have funded the Administration's proposal to increase the size of the armed forces by 15,600 personnel in the active components – with nearly half of that increase destined for the Navy – and by a total of 800 members of the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. The Senate-passing version would have funding less than half the amount of the proposed increase in active-duty personnel and none of the amount in the reserve component. Both the House and Senate versions would have authorized a 2.6% increase in military basic pay effective January 1, 2019. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the cost of this raise to be $1.8 billion. The President's FY2019 budget request for DOD included $633.7 billion in base budget funding, including both OCO and OCO-designated funding. The total amount requested for DOD and amounts provided in the FY2018 appropriations bill as enacted are relatively close. Within those gross totals, however, there are differences between the amounts requested and the amounts provided for hundreds of specific elements within the sprawling DOD budget. Many of these individual differences reflect congressional judgements about particular issues. However, there also are patterns of differences that reflect congressional views on broad policy or budgetary questions. For example, Title I of the act, that funds Military Personnel accounts, provides $2.2 billion less than was requested for pay and benefits. House-Senate conferees said the reduction should have no adverse impact on the force. For dozens of additional cuts from the base budget O&M request, they cited rationales that imply that the reductions need not have an adverse effect on DOD activities: Cuts were justified by the assumption that particular programs would underspend their budget requests by that amount, often on the basis of what they called a pattern of historic al underexecution of their annual appropriations; Cuts totaling $3.3 billion were justified on grounds that DOD had not justified its request for those funds; and C cuts totaling $343 million were justified because the requests amounted to unrealistically large increases over the prior year's appropriation. On the other hand, total procurement funding in the act (Title III) is $4.8 million higher than the request. While the act makes hundreds of additions and cuts to the funding requested for particular items, three broad themes all push the act's procurement total upward: $2,48 billion is added to buy aircraft and other equipment for National Guard and reserve forces; $ 2.31 billion is add to fully fund or acquire major components for additional six ships; and $2 to the $8.49 billion requested for procurement of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.
The annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations legislation (SFOPS) funds many of the nondefense international affairs activities of the U.S. government. It is one of 12 appropriations bills that Congress considers annually to fund the government's discretionary activities. Congress structures SFOPS into several titles, which consist of broad spending categories. These titles are subdivided into paragraphs that each address one component account, a funding line item that includes one or several activities. A single component account may cover one agency's entire annual budget, grant funds to an independent organization, or fund multiple activities associated with statutory authorities, among other things. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6) is divided into eight titles, each associated with the following activities: Title I—Department of State and Related Agency. Title II—United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Title III—Bilateral Economic Assistance. Title IV—International Security Assistance (ISA). Title V—Multilateral Assistance (International Organizations and Programs). Title VI—Export and Investment Assistance (Export-Import Bank of the United States). Title VII—General Provisions. Title VIII—Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. Title IX—Peacekeeping Operations. This report identifies the statutory authorities that enable each component account to function. For information on SFOPS funding levels, trends, and congressional action, see CRS Report R45168, Department of state, foreign operations and related programs: FY2019 Budget and Appropriations, by Susan B. Epstein, Marian L. Lawson, and Cory R. Gill.

The Constitution provides Congress with broad powers over the Armed Forces, including the power "to raise and support Armies," "to provide and maintain a Navy," and "to make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." It also provides the Senate with the authority to provide "Advice and Consent" on presidential nominations of "all other Officers of the United States," which includes military officers. On the basis of its constitutional authority, Congress has passed a number of laws which govern important aspects of military officer personnel management, including appointments, assignments, grade structure, promotions, and separations. The phrase "general and flag officers" or "GFO" refers to all officers in paygrades O-7 through O-10, thereby including one- star, two-star, three-Star, and four-star officers. At the highest level, GFOs hold the most visible and important military positions in the Department of Defense, such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chiefs of the four military services, and the combatant commanders. They also hold positions that span an array of roles, including commanders, deputy commanders, and key staff roles in large organizations. Congress has established a statutory framework for general and flag officer (GFO) positions that provides for greater congressional control over the most senior positions, while providing substantial latitude to the executive branch in the management of the remaining positions. Congress also periodically reviews the number, duties, and compensation of General and Flag Officers. A frequent tension during these reviews has been DOD requests for additional General andFlag Officers versus congressional concerns that there are too many General and flag Officers. This report provides an overview of active duty GFO, including authorizations, duties and compensation, historical trends in the proportion of GFO relative to the total force, criticisms and justifications for GFO to total force proportions, and statutory controls. National Guard and Reserve GFO are not addressed in this report, unless they are serving on active duty in a manner that counts against the active duty caps on GFO. As of November 1, 2018, there were 920 active duty General andflag officers, of which 891 were subject to the statutory caps and 29 were exempt from the caps. The 891 GFOS subject to statutory caps is lower than the maximum of 963 authorized in statute. This is in accord with an intentional decision made by DOD in 2011 as part of an efficiency initiative directed by then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. By keeping GFO numbers substantially below the maximum authorized, this policy provides DOD flexibility to respond to new requirements for G FOs without the delays caused by the need to find an "offset" by downgrading or eliminating another GFO position.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) provides an avenue of legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment committed by professors, teachers, coaches, and others at educational institutions. The statute prohibits discrimination "on the basis of sex" of any person in an educational program or activity receiving federal funding. Title IX applies to federal-funded schools at all levels of education. Though Title IX makes no explicit reference to sexual abuse or harassment, the Supreme Court has held that a school district can violate the statute, and be held liable for damages, based on a deliberately indifferent response to a teacher's sexual abuse of a student. The Court has also held that the school board may be liable under Title IX for a deliberately indifference response to student-on-student sexual harassment. Meanwhile, federal agencies that administratively enforce Title IX, such as the Department of Education (ED), have also determined that educational institutions can be held responsible for instances of sexual harassment under the statute in certain circumstances. In response, educational institutions have developed procedures and practices to investigate and respond to sexual harassment and assault allegations. In each of the last several presidential administrations, however, ED has issued guidance documents that instruct schools regarding their responsibilities when addressing allegations of sexual assault or harassment. And ED recently issued another notice of proposed rulemaking, after having revoked some of its prior guidance to schools in 2017. If adopted, the proposed Title IX regulations would significantly change educational institutions' responsibilities for responding to sexual assault and harassment allegations. Among other things, the proposal would (1) define in narrower terms what conduct qualifies as sexual harassment; (2) require "actual notice" of harassment, rather than constructive notice, to trigger a school's Title IX responsibilities; (3) provide that a schools' response to allegations of harassment will violate the statutes only if amounting to deliberate indifference; and (4) impose new procedural requirements that reflect concern for due process when schools investigate allegations and make determinations of culpability. This report provides background on the legal landscape that informs the proposal. First, the report examines how federal courts have understood Title IX's requirements in the context of private rights of action brought by students directly against educational institutions seeking damages for sexual harassment or abuse. The report continues by examining how federal agencies have enforced Title IX in the administrative enforcement context, with particular focus on how ED's guidance documents direct schools on how to respond toSexual harassment and sexual assault allegations at schools that receive federal funds. Finally, it considers various constitutional challenges brought against public universities, which claim that some universities' responses to sexual misconduct allegations have violated the due process rights of the accused.
The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of three Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class destroyers. Decisions that Congress makes concerning destroyer procurement could substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements, and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base. This report presents background information and potential oversight issues for Congress on the Navy's destroyer programs. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the DDg-51, DDG-1000, and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke. The Navy's FY2020 request for procurement funding of three DDG -51s is $5,463.0 million. The ships have received $363.7 million in prior-year Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) advance procurement (AP) funding (i.e., funding for up-front batch orders of components to be procured under the FY2018-FY2022 Multiyear Procurement (MYP) contract). The Navy estimates the combined procurement cost of the three DD-51s requested for procurement in FY2020 at $5.3 million, excluding outfitting and post-delivery costs. The proposed FY 2020 budget also requests $155.9 million in procurement funding to help complete the total procurement cost for the threeDDG -1000 class ships. The FY2020 funding request includes $224 million in EOQ funding for DDG –51s procured in FY2021 and FY2022, bringing the total amount requested for the DDG–51 program for FY2020 to $5; the Navy estimates that the total cost to procure the three ships for FY2019 is $6.1 billion. The DDG 1000 program was initiated in the early 1990s as a multi-mission destroyer with an originally intended emphasis on naval surface fire support (NSFS) and operations in littoral waters. The program was originally intended to replace, in a technologically more modern form, the large-caliber naval gun fire capability that the Navy lost when it retired its Iowa-class battleships in the mid-1990s, to improve the Navys general capabilities for operating in defended littoran waters, and to introduce several new technologies that would be available for use on future Navy ships, including an integrated electric-drive propulsion system and automation technologies enabling its reduced-sized crew. The first ship in the class was commissioned into service on October 15, 2016, although its delivery date was revised from May 2018 to December 2018, creating an unusual situation in which a ship was commissioned in service more than two years prior to its expected delivery date. The delivery dates for the second and third ships were revised in the Navy’s FY2018 budget submission to May 2020 and December 2021, respectively, and were revised further to September 2020 and September 2022, respectively. In April 2018, the Navy announced that it wants to extend the service lives of all DDG  class ships to 45 yearsan increase of 5 or 10 years over previous plans to operate DDGs to age 35 or 40. Doing this, it has said, will permit the Navy to achieve a total of 355 ships by 2034, or about 20 years earlier than under the proposed FY2019 budget submission, although the 355-ship fleet of the 2030s would have more destroyers and fewer ships of other kinds (including attack submarines and aircraft carriers) than called for in the 355 ship force-level goal.
The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations act provides funding for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, select science agencies, and several related agencies. It also funds the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The act also funds a variety of grant programs for state, local, and tribal governments. For FY2018, Congress and the President provided a total of $72.119 billion for CJS. This included $70.921 billion in regular funding provided pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) and $1.198 billion in emergency-designated funding provided through the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act,2018 (P.) 115-123. The Administration requested $66.555 billion in CJS funding for FY2019, which was 6.2% less than regular FY2018 funding. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a bill (H.R. 5952) that would have funded CJS at $73.923 billion, an amount that was 11.1% more than the Administration's request. The committee-reported bill would have provided the following: $12.106 billion for Commerce; $31.113 billion for Justice; $29.728 billion for the science agencies; and $976 million for the related agencies, which were 0.2%, 0.3%, and 77.1%, respectively. The Senate Committee on appropriations reported its FY2019 CJS bill (S. 3072) on February 14, 2019. It would have increased funding for most CJS accounts at or above the FY2018 level, with a few notable exceptions. For example, the Senate committee would have decreased funding for NIST's Construction of Research Facilities account (-$161 million, -50.5%), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction account (-21.1%), and NASA's Space Operations account (-2.4%). The committee did not adopt many of the proposals the Administration put forth in its FY2018 budget, including its proposed account structure for NASA, which would have created three new accounts: Exploration Research and Technology, Deep Space Exploration Systems, and low Earth orbit (LEO) and Spaceflight Operations. On February 15, 2019, President Trump signed into law the consolidated appropriations act, 2019 (the Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2019, 2019; P. l. 116-6), which includes $72 million for C JS. The FY2019 enacted amount is 2.8% more for the Commerce Department and 9.5% less for the Justice Department than was provided for FY2018. The act includes $11.414 billion (2.5%) for the Department of Commerce, $30.934 billion (7.3% more) for the DOJ, and $ 29.583 billion (8.1%) for science agencies. The related agencies would have received $977 million (0.3%) and $989 million (77.3%), respectively. This report will be updated as events warrant.
The nuclear power industry is facing severe economic challenges in the United States. High capital costs, low electricity demand growth, and competition from cheaper sources of electricity such as natural gas and renewables have dampened the demand for new nuclear power plants and accelerated the retirement of existing reactors. There are currently 98 operating U.S. reactors. As aging reactors reach the end of their operating licenses in 2030 and beyond, the number of retirements is projected to increase. In addition, cost and schedule overruns have hindered recent efforts to build new nuclear units. The only power reactors currently under construction in theUnited States—two new units at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia—are five years behind schedule and nearly double their original estimated cost. Congress enacted legislation in September 2018 that defines "advanced nuclear reactor" as "a nuclear fission reactor with significant improvements over the most recent generation of nuclear fissions reactors" or a reactor using nuclear fusion (P.L. 115-248). Titled the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act of 2017 (NEICA), the law requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to take several actions to support advanced reactor development, including studying the need for a versatile fast neutron test reactor that could help develop fuels and materials for advanced reactors. Congress included $65 million for R&D to support development of the versatile test reactor in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for FY2019 (Division A of P.L., 115-244), and the Trump Administration has requested $100 million more for FY2020. At the same time conventional reactors are facing an uncertain future, some in Congress contend that more nuclear power Plants, not fewer, are needed to help reduce U. S. greenhouse gas emissions and bring low-carbon power to the majority of the world that currently has little access to electricity. Advocates of nuclear power cite a variety of reasons in addition to greenhouse gas reduction for preserving and expanding the U.s. nuclear industry. They contend that a robust domestic nuclear energy industry would contribute to such goals as energy security and diversification, electricity grid resilience and reliability, promotion of a domestic nuclear component manufacturing base and associated exports, clean air, and preservation and enhancement of geopolitical influence. Some observers have suggested that the Navy and other national security organizations benefit from maintaining a strong domesticnuclear energy industry, which provides a post-military career path for many naval reactor personnel, as well as expanding the base of qualified engineers and technicians, and strengthening the infrastructure for training and knowledge transfer. Opponents of this view argue that the key to increasing the numbers of nuclear plants is investment in advanced nuclear technologies, which they say could overcome the economic problems, safety concerns, and other issues that have stalled the growth of conventional light water reactors (LWRs). Advanced reactors include a wide range of technologies, including next-generation water-cooled reactors, small modular reactors (SMRs), non-water- cooled reactors, molten salt reactors (MSRs), high temperature gas reactors, and fusion reactors. Some advanced reactor concepts are relatively new, while others have been under consideration for decades. Not all observers are optimistic about the potential safety, affordability, proliferation resistance, and sustainability of advanced nuclear reactors. Many advanced reactors would use fuels that are not currently commercially available, either due to lack of demand or technological immaturity. These include higher-enriched versions of existing uranium fuel and new types of fuel that are currently under development. Many of these advanced reactor designs are smaller than the existing fleet of LWRs and are designed for modular installation. Some of these reactors may also be designed for new applications or to capture new markets, such as providing process heat for district heating, desalination, petroleum refining and oil shale processing, steam reforming of natural gas, cogeneration, biomass or coal gasification, and hydrogen production, among others. Advanced reactors may nevertheless face steep barriers to entry into these markets in the form of competition from other sources (with or without carbon capture and storage) that are perceived as being less risky, both physically and economically. The radioactivity of nuclear waste presents waste management and facility contamination challenges that are unique to nuclear energy.
Electronic warfare (EW)—sometimes also called electromagnetic maneuver warfare (EMW)—is a component of modern warfare, particularly in response to threats posed by technologically sophisticated potential adversaries such as Russia and China. EW generally refers to operations that use the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., the "airwaves") to detect, listen to, jam, and deceive (or "spoof") enemy radars, radio communication systems and data links, and other electronic systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) has three primary manned EW electronic attack aircraft: the EA-18G Growler, EC-130H Compass Call, and EC-37B Compass Call Re-Host. DOD also has several unmanned EW aircraft, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which has built-in EW capabilities that are claimed by Lockheed Martin officials—the prime contractor manufacturing the aircraft—to be significantly greater than that of previous U.S. fighters and attack aircraft. The Air Force does not operate an EW aircraft directly analogous to the Navy's EA- 18G. The last such Air Force aircraft was the EF-111 Raven, an EW variant of the F.111 fighter, which the Air Force retired in 1998. The Navy and Marine Corps continue to operate and invest in a number of EW aircraft that are similar to or have evolved from EA-6B Prowler aircraft, which were operated by both the Navy and the Marine Corps. These aircraft are also operated by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). In recent years, the shift in the international security environment from the post-Cold War era to an era of renewed great power competition has increased the focus on EW in U. S. defense planning and programming. In particular, attention has been given to aspects of EW related to high-end warfare and to concerns among some observers that the United States needs to strengthen its efforts in EW as part of its overall effort to preserve its qualitative military superiority over potential adversaries. Congress has continually shown interest in EW, and airborne electronic attack in particular. Some Members have formed the EW Working Group, and they routinely discuss improving EW capabilities. The National Defense Authorization Acts over the past several years have included provisions related to EW and electronic attack. Most recently the FY2019 John S. McCain National Defense authorization Act, discussed the Air Air Force's acquisition strategy for a new EW attack aircraft as well as a study to catalogue all EW capabilities, and the President's FY2020 budget request for DOD seeks funding for several airborne EW programs. The House Armed Services Committee, in its report (H.Rept. 115-676 of May 15, 2018) on H.R. 5515, the FY2018 Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, stated that the committee supports the Air force's efforts to recapitalize the aging EC–130H fleet with the more capable EC–37 type aircraft. However, the committee notes that before it can carry on with the transition plan, the Department must first comply with the related provisions in the National Defense Authorizations Act for FY2017 (Public Law 114-328) and FY2018 (Public law 115-91). The committee encourages the Secretary to make a timely determination for this requirement to avoid further program delays and cost overruns. In the 115th Congress, Representative Bacon introduced the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Readiness Act of 2018, H.r. 5522, which would have asked the DOD to develop a joint campaign modeling capability to model electromagnetic spectrum effect on operations, assess capabilities and capacities of EW platforms associated with operational plans, and develop an interim and annual report on programs and personnel assigned to EW missions. An identical bill in the Senate was referred to the Senate Armed Service Committee.
The Department of Defense (DOD) obligates more than $300 billion annually to pay for goods and services (including research and development). Most of these acquisitions are governed by numerous statutes and regulations found in Title 10 of the United States Code, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and the Defense Federal Acquisition regulation Supplement (DFARS). DOD can enter into certain transactions without triggering most of the standard acquisition statutes and Regulations by using other transaction (OT) authorities. Other transactions are legally binding contracts that are generally exempt from federal procurement laws and regulations such as the Competition in Contracting Act and the Federal acquisition Regulation. In contrast, traditional procurement contracts must adhere to the procurement rules set forth in statute and regulation. Generally, DOD can use other transaction authorities for three purposes: 1. conduct research, 2. develop prototypes, or 3. contract for follow-on production of a successful prototype project. In recent years, Congress has expanded these authorities and DOD is increasingly using OTs for research, prototyping, and production. OTs can be structured in numerous ways, including a direct relationship between a single government agency and a single provider; joint ventures; partnerships; multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers; or through a consortium. A consortium is an organized group—it can consist of nonprofits, academic institutions, or contractors— focusing on a specific technology area. Consortia can act to facilitate multiparty agreements whereby each member is akin to its own co-prime contractor with the government. A number of analysts argue that using consortia in this way gives the federal government a unique ability to leverage and pool the technological expertise and innovation of multiple entities in a particular sector, thereby strengthening and advancing a sector of the industrial base that may have defense applications. In the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2018 (P.L. 115-91), Congress authorized the Secretary of Defense and the military departments the authority to pursue basic research, applied research, advanced research, and development projects under the OT authorities granted in Sections 2371 and 2371b of Title 10, 10 U.S.C. 2371a, and 2372. The NDAA also authorized nonprofit research institutions to enter into OTs with DOD for prototype projects. The conference report for the FY2019 NDAA for the John S. McCain National Defense authorization bill (H.R. 6157) included language expressing the conferees' "[concern] with the lack of transparency surrounding the employment of OTA, particularly for follow on production," and directed DOD to provide quarterly reports to the House and Senate appropriations committees listing each active OT, and to include additional information for each agreement. Congress also directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review DOD's use of OTs to determine whether the "employment of this authority conforms to applicable statutes and guidelines, to include the identification of any potential conflicts." Congress also required GAO to report on the extent to which OTs have been used since FY2016. In addition, the conference report included language directing DOD to submit a report to Congress on the number of traditional and nontraditional defense contractors with DOD contracts or other transactions resulting directly from the Defense Innovation Unit's initiatives. In FY2017, DOD obligated $2.1 billion—and received $360 million in cost-share contributions—on prototype other transaction agreements, representing less than 1% of DOD's total FY2017 contract obligations (approximately $320 billion). Despite the small percentage of obligations, OTs are growing quickly and are expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace. The Army executed more than 66% of the prototype OT agreements between FY2013 and FY2017.
The Latin American and Caribbean region has made significant advances over the past three decades in terms of both political and economic development. With 33 countries—ranging from the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, one of the world's smallest states, to the South American giant of Brazil—the region has become a relatively stable and prosperous region. In the early 1980s, however, 16 countries in the region were governed by authoritarian regimes, both on the left and the right. Today, most governments are elected democracies, at least formally. Free and fair elections have become the norm in most countries, although elections in several countries have been controversial and contested. In 2017, the Bahamas, Ecuador, and Chile held successful elections for heads of government. Elections in Honduras in November 2017 were characterized by significant irregularities, with the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) calling for new elections to be held. Despite a series of mass civil protests, incumbent President Juan Orlando Hernández was certified as the winner in December 2017. With the exception of Venezuela, all of these elections were free and fair. The Venezuelan election, boycotted by most opposition parties, was significantly flawed. In addition, Cuba underwent a political transition in April, when Raúl Castro stepped down from power and Cuba's legislature selected a new president. Despite significant improvements in political rights and civil liberties, many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean still face considerable challenges. In a number of countries, weaknesses remain in the state's ability to deliver public services, ensure accountability and transparency, advance the rule of law, and ensure citizen safety and security. One factor contributing to this democratic erosion is increased organized crime. Organized crime has particularly affected Mexico and several Central American countries because of the increased use of the region as a drug transit zone and the associated rise in corruption, crime, and violence. A second factor negatively affecting democracy has been the executive's abuse of power. Elected leaders have sought to consolidate power at the expense of minority rights, leading to a setback in liberal democratic practices. Venezuela stands out in this regard, with President Nicolás Maduro repressing the opposition with force and manipulating state institutions to retain power. Media freedom deteriorated in several other countries in recent years, precipitated by the increase in organized crime-related violence and by politically driven attempts to curb critical or independent media. In 2018, several countries experienced significant political challenges. Peru's president resigned in March just ahead of a vote on impeachment on corruption charges. In Nicaragua, widespread protests against the government of President Daniel Ortega were suppressed violently, with over 300 people killed. In Brazil, far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro won the presidential race in October; given Bolosonaro's coarse campaign rhetoric, which included a vow to purge Brazil of leftist political opponents, many observers have concerns that his election could pose a threat to democracy and human rights. In Guatemala, efforts by President Jimmy Morales to undermine and expel the U.N.-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) prompted widespread protests and expressions of international concern. In Central America, the United States has supported anticorruption efforts in Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The Trump Administration has sought to reduce U.S. assistance to the region by more than a third since FY2017. The 115th Congress did not complete action on FY2019 foreign aid appropriations for the region, but it did approve several continuing resolutions that continued funding at FY2018 levels through December 21, 2018, leaving full-year funding for FY2019 to the 116th Congress.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that administers the trade rules and agreements negotiated by its 164 members to eliminate trade barriers and create nondiscriminatory rules to govern trade. It also serves as an important forum for resolving trade disputes. Congress has recognized the WTO as the "foundation of the global trading system" within U.S. trade legislation and plays a direct legislative and oversight role over WTO agreements. The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO in 1995 and the rules and agreement that resulted from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986-1994). The WTO encompassed and expanded on the commitments and institutional functions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1947 by the United States and 22 other nations. Through the GATT and WTO, the United states and other countries sought to establish a more open, rules-based trading system in the postwar era, with the goal of fostering international economic cooperation, stability, and prosperity worldwide. Today, the vast majority of world trade, approximately 98%, takes place among WTO members. The terms set by the WTO agreements govern the majority of U. S. trading relationships. Some 65% of U.-S. global trade is with countries that do not have free trade agreements (FTAs) with the UnitedStates, including China, the European Union (EU), India, and Japan, and thus rely on the terms of WTO agreements, which also form the basis of many of their trade policies. The WTO's effectiveness as a negotiating body for broad-based trade liberalization has come under intensified scrutiny, as has its role in resolving trade Dispute Settlement (DS) disputes. The most recent round of WTO negotiations, the Doha Round, began in November 2001, but concluded with no clear path forward, leaving multiple unresolved issues after the 10th Ministerial conference in 2015. While WTO members have made some progress toward determining future work plans, no major deliverables or negotiated outcomes were announced at the 11th Ministerials in December 2017 and no consensus Ministerial Declaration was released. Many have concerns that the growing use of protectionist trade policies by developed and developing countries, recent U.N. tariff actions and counterretaliation, and escalating trade disputes between major economies may further strain the multilateral trading system. The World Trade Organisation is faced with resolving several significant pending disputes, which involve the United Nations, and resolving debates about the role and procedures of its Appellate Body, which reviews appeals of dispute cases. In a break from past Administrations' approaches, U.s. officials have recently expressed doubt over whether the WTO organization is a benefit or cost to the United State. While USTR Robert Lighthizer acknowledged at the most recent Ministerial that the WTO is an "important institution" that does an "enormous amount of good good," the Trump Administration has expressed deep skepticism toward multilateraltrade deals, including those negotiated within the WTO. President Trump has also threatened at times to withdraw the United United States from the WTO, and has stated that he would prefer bilateral or plurilateral trade agreements rather than multilateral agreements. While some of these concerns are not new and are shared by other trading partners, the Administration's overall approach has spurred new questions regarding the future of the multilaterally negotiated trading system and the role of the World Trade organization. In particular, some Members of Congress have expressed concerns over the value of the Multilateral System and the potential impact of withdrawal from the World trade organization on U.C. businesses, consumers, federal agencies, laws and regulations, and foreign policy.
Venezuela, long one of the most prosperous countries in South America with the world's largest proven oil reserves, continues to be in the throes of a deep political, economic, and humanitarian crisis. Whereas populist President Hugo Chávez (1998-2013) governed during a period of generally high oil prices, his successor, Nicolás Maduro of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), has exacerbated an economic downturn caused by low global oil prices through mismanagement and corruption. President Maduro won reelection in early elections held in May 2018 that were dismissed as illegitimate by the United States, the European Union (EU), the G-7, and a majority of countries in the Western Hemisphere. U.S. relations with Venezuela, a major oil supplier, have deteriorated as the Maduro government has manipulated democratic institutions; cracked down on the opposition, media, and civil society; engaged in drug trafficking and corruption; and refused most humanitarian aid. Since 2014, Venezuela's economy has contracted each year, and the pace of economic contraction has accelerated in recent years. Inflation has increased from 254% in 2016 to 1,087% in 2017, and in 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that inflation (as measured by average changes in consumer prices) will reach 1,370,000% in 2018. Hyperinflation, as well as low foreign exchange reserves, which make it difficult for Venezuela to import goods and services, has created shortages of critical supplies (including food and medicine), leading to a humanitarian disaster and fueling massive migration. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 3 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants had left the country by November 2018, with the vast majority remaining in the Latin America and Caribbean region. By the end of 2019, UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimate that the number of Venezuelans who have fled the country could reach over 5.3 million. The United States is providing humanitarian and emergency food assistance and helping to coordinate regional response efforts. The Trump Administration has imposed sanctions on several senior Venezuelan officials, including President Maduro's wife and four members of his inner circle, and has sought to increase pressure on the government through targeted sanctions. The Administration has also supported the Organization of American States' (OAS) efforts to address the situation in Venezuela. Since the May 2018 election, President Maduro has faced mounting economic problems, coup attempts, and increasing international isolation. On January 10, 2019, President Nicolas Maduro began a second term after a May 2018 elections that has been deemed illegitimate by Venezuela's democratically elected, opposition-controlled National Assembly and much of the international community. Under the leadership of a little-known figure, Juan Guaidó of the Popular Will (VP) party, the National Assembly has issued a direct challenge to the legitimacy of Maduro's presidency. The National Assembly declared that President Maduro had usurped the presidency on January 15, 2019. The legislature also established a framework for the formation of a transitional government led by Juan Guaido, the president of the legislature, to serve until presidential elections can be held (per Article 233 of the constitution). In addition, the legislature approved amnesty from prosecution for public officials who facilitate the transition. The government-aligned Supreme Court issued a ruling declaring the legislature illegitimate and its rulings unconstitutional. The Supreme Court also ordered the arrest of 27 members of the National Guard who allegedly stole weapons (since recovered) as they tried to incite an uprising against the government. It remains to be seen how the security forces will respond to these developments and to protests that have been called for January 23, 2019 and beyond. The 115th Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 115-31, H.R. 244) to provide $7.7 million in democracy and human rights assistance to Venezuelan civil society in FY2017 and $15 million in FY2018. Congress has yet to enact a full-year FY2019 appropriations measure, although a series of continuing resolutions provided FY2019 funding through December 21, 2018. Legislation to fund foreign aid programs for the remainder of FY2019 could incorporate provisions from the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations measures that the House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved during the 115thCongress. The House Committee bill (H.R., 6385) recommended providing $15million for programs in Venezuela, while the Senate Committee bill(S. 3108) recommended $20 million.
The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is used to finance the payment of federal Black Lung Program benefits under Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA) when a responsible coal operator does not meet its obligations under the law to pay benefits. Black lung disease is an interstitial lung disease caused by the inhalation of coal dust. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP, commonly referred to as black lung disease) can lead to loss of lung function, the need for lung transplantation, and premature death. CWP can be identified by observing light spots, or opacities, in x-ray images of the lungs and can be classified using guidelines established by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Despite technological advances in mining dust control, mandatory chest x-rays for miners, free CWP surveillance offered to miners by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the enactment of numerous pieces of mine safety and health legislation, CWP persists in American coal miners, especially those in the Appalachian region. After reductions in rates of progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) in the 1990s, this advanced form of CWP has recently been found in Central Appalachia at rates not seen since the early 1970s. In 2017 researchers discovered, among coal miners mostly living in Kentucky and Virginia and served by three federally funded Black Lung Clinics in Virginia, what may be the largest cluster of PMF ever recorded. This cluster includes a relatively high number of miners with less than 20 years of mining experience as well as cases of PMP in current miners. The occurrence of this advanced stage ofCWP in short-tenured and current miners is noteworthy since MSHA standards require that any miner with evidence of CWPsp be given the option, without loss of compensation or other penalty, to work in an area of the mining operation in which the average concentration of coal Dust in the air is continuously maintained at or below an established level that is lower than the permissible exposure level for all miners with the goal of preventing the progression of CWp. The federal Black lung program was created in 1969 with the passage of Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (Coal Act, P.L. 95-164). The Coal Act established Part B of the federal program to provide cash benefits to miners totally disabled due to CWP and to the survivors of miners who die from CWP. Part B only applies to cases filed on or before December 31, 1973 and is paid out of general revenue. Today, with the exception of a small number of pending appellate cases, Part B benefits are administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP). Under Part C, all claims for benefits for disability or death due toCWP are to be filed with each state's workers' compensation system, but only if such systems have been determined by DOL as providing benefits that are equivalent to or greater than the cash benefits provided by the federal government under Part B and the medical benefits provided to disabled longshore and harbor workers under the federal Longshore and Harbor Workers' compensation Act (LHWCA). In 1973, Maryland, Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia submitted their state workers' Compensation laws to DOL for approval, but were denied. To date, no state system has been approved to pay Part C benefits.
The Army's Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) constitute the Army's "light" ground forces and are an important part of the nation's ability to rapidly project forces overseas. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as current thinking as to where and how future conflicts would be fought, suggest IBCTs are limited operationally by their lack of assigned transport and reconnaissance vehicles and firepower against hardened targets and armored vehicles. To address these limitations, the Army is undertaking three programs: the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV)/Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), formerly known as the Ultra-Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV); the Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV); and the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) programs. These programs would be based on vehicles that are commercially available. This is in order to reduce costs and the time it takes to field combat vehicles associated with traditional developmental efforts. The Army plans to acquire the vehicles as modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI) platforms. Because the Army adopted the NDI acquisition approach for all three vehicles, it can enter the programs at Acquisition Milestone C: Production and Deployment, and forgo the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase associated with developmental items (systems developed "from scratch") if so desired. Theoretically, adopting a NDI approach could lead to a shorter acquisition time line and a less expensive overall acquisition. In addition to the GMV/ISV, LRV, and MPF programs, in February 2017 the Army announced it would establish six Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs)—five in the Active Component and one in the Army National Guard. SFABs are to be capable of conducting security force assistance (SFA) operations at the tactical (brigade and below) level. While not combat brigades per se, they are intended to be expanded, if the need arises, into fully operational Army brigades or fully operational Airborne brigades. If the Army expands some of these brigades, it could have an impact on the number of vehicles needed to fully equip these units. While these numbers would likely be modest, it might be of interest to Congress to know how many additional vehicles would be required. Since they would not be part of SFAB's organic equipment and only needed in the event of Army expansion, how and when will these vehicles be procured and how will they be maintained so that they would be available when needed? This report will be updated as events warrant.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers a number of federal farm programs, including commodity programs, disaster assistance programs, crop insurance programs, and conservation programs. Program eligibility requirements and payment limits are central to how these programs operate. These requirements fundamentally address various equity concerns and reflect the goals of government intervention in agriculture. They determine who receives federal farm program payments and how much they receive. Eligibility requirements are controversial because they influence what size farms are supported and because they generate considerable congressional interest because their effects differ across regions and by type of commodities produced and because a substantial amount of annual farm program outlays are at stake: Direct federal outlays have averaged $13.7 billion per year from 1996 through 2017. When federal crop insurance premium subsidies are included, annual farm payments averaged $18.5 billion over the same period. The 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-246) retained the $900,000 cap on average gross adjusted gross income (AGI) for all farm income whether earned on the farm or off the farm. Under the 2008 farm bill, the AGI limit was divided into two components: a $500,000 limit for farm-earned income and a $750,000 AGI cap on nonfarm earned income. The 2014 farm bill retained the single farm- and nonfarm-specific AGI limits but added a case-by-case waiver for conservation programs that would protect environmentally sensitive land of special significance. Other major exemptions from the cap include state and local governments and agencies, federally recognized Indian tribes, and waivers under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRP). The 2018 bill retained these exemptions but also added a provision for married individuals filing a joint tax return to allocate the average AGI as if a separate return had been filed by each spouse. In the case of a payment to a general partnership or joint venture comprising multiple individuals, the payment would be reduced by an amount that is commensurate with the share of ownership interest of each person who has an averageAGI in excess of $900 the previous year. In addition to annual payment limits, certain farm programs are not subject to payment limits. These include the marketing assistance loan (MAL) program, sugar program, dairy program, and three of the four disaster programs (ELAP, LIP, and TAP). In addition, the Secretary of Agriculture has broad authority to make payments in support of agriculture under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) charter. These payments may be purely ad hoc in nature, or they may be made according to a formula as part of a temporary program. Payments under this type of authority may or may not be subject to a payment limit in accordance with the program's specification. The CCC charter also authorizes the Secretary to make temporary payments to offset the financial losses associated with lost agricultural trade to China as a result of a trade dispute with the United States. In August 2018, USDA established the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) as a one-time payment program. MFP payments are subject to an annual payment limit of $125,000 per person. However, the limit applies separately to three categories of commodities—field crops (corn, sorghum, soybeans, upland cotton, and wheat); livestock (dairy and hogs); and specialty crops (shelled almonds and fresh, sweet cherries). When the farm program benefits for a qualifying recipient exceed the annual limits for a given year, then that individual is no longer eligible for further benefits under that particular program during that year and is required to refund any payments already received under that program that are in exceed of the relevant payment limit for that year. This report discusses various eligibility factors and their interaction under the 2018 farm bills. It describes current restrictions that limit or preclude payments to farmers based on a variety of factors as well as areas where few, if any, restrictions limit farmers' access to such benefits or to the amount of benefits. It also discusses several issues related to farm program payment limits that may be of interest to Congress.
This report provides background information and issues for Congress regarding the U.S. role in the world, meaning the overall character, purpose, or direction of the United States' participation in international affairs and the country's overall relationship to the rest of the world. Some observers perceive that after remaining generally stable for a period of about 70 years (i.e., over the past 70 years or so), the U."S. Role in the World" is undergoing a potentially historic change. A change in that role could have significant and even profound effects on U. S. security, freedom, and prosperity. It could also have implications for future international order. The overall issue for Congress is how to respond to recent developments regarding that role. Congress's decisions on this issue may have significant implications for numerous policies, plans, programs, and budgets. A variety of other CRS reports address in greater depth specific policy areas mentioned in this report. Appendix A provides a glossary of some key terms used in the report, including role, grand strategy, international order/world order, unipolar/bipolar/tripolar/multipolar, Eurasia, regional hegemon, spheres-of-influence world, geopolitics, hard power, and soft power. Footnotes with citations taking up more than 10 lines of type have had their citations transferred to Appendix B. This report will be updated as events warrant.

The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution generally provides that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." While the First Amendment generally protects the "freedom of speech," its protections do not apply in the same way in all cases. Not every government regulation affecting content posted on social media sites would be analyzed in thesame way. A court's analysis would depend on a number of factors. First, a court would inquire into the nature of the precise action being regulated, including whether it is properly characterized as speech or conduct. Laws that target conduct and only incidentally burden speech may be permissible. Once state action is established, the next consideration is to what extent the FirstAmendment protects social media platforms' content moderation decisions. Stated another way, the relevant question is when social media providers can assert that government regulation infringes on their own speech. Perhaps most obviously, if a social media site posts content that it has created itself, the site may raise First Amendment objections to a law expressly regulating that speech. Social media providers may also argue that they are exercising protected speech rights when they are choosing whether to publish content that was originally created by users and when they make decisions about how to present that content. However, the fact that a law affects speech protected by the first Amendment does not necessarily mean that it is unconstitutional. The First Amendment allows some regulation of speech and does not prohibit regulation of conduct. Courts have held that, for example, that the government may regulate speech when it has a compelling governmental interest and when it is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. If a regulation is content-neutral, which is to say, "justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech," a court might apply a lower level of scrutiny to that regulation. In contrast, a law that targets speech based on its content would likely be subject to a higher level of review. Courts may also look to the particular type of speech being regulated to determine whether the regulation is constitutionally permissible. For example, courts have said that speech that is "obscene or defamatory" may be constitutionally proscribed if the government has a social interest in order and morality that outweighs the negligible contribution of those categories of speech to the marketplace of ideas. In addition, the Supreme Court has said that "the government may proscribe libel," but "it may not make the further content discrimination of proscribing only libel critical of the government." If a law targets speech rather than conduct, it is likely that it will target that speech on the basis of its content, and therefore will likely be content- neutral on its face. But a law targeting speech could still be found to be unconstitutional if it is overbroad, in the sense that it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech, as well. Thus, in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, the Court held that a federal statute prohibiting "sexually explicit images that appear to depict minors" was unconstitutionally overbroad. The statute encompassed pornography that did "not depict an actual child," prohibiting images that were "created by using adults who look like minors or by using computer imaging," as those two categories had been defined in prior Supreme Court cases. In Ashcroft, however, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it "proscribe[d] a significant universe of speech" that was neither obscene nor child pornography. The Supreme Court also has recognized that the principles developed "in the context of streets and parks" should not be extended in a mechanical way to the very different context of newer media, such as video games and the internet. While the Court has characterized social media as "the modern public square," it has not fully clarified what standards should apply to government regulation of that medium—particularly with respect to social media websites' roles as hosts for others' speech. The Court has been willing to extend First Amendment protections that historically applied to speech communicated in traditional public forums such as streets and sidewalks to new mediums for communication, including video games or the internet, but it has also recognized that these principles should be applied in a more narrowly.
Concurrent receipt refers to the simultaneous receipt of two types of monetary benefits: military retired pay and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation. With several separate programs, varying eligibility criteria, and several eligibility dates, some observers find the subject complex and somewhat confusing. There are, however, two common criteria: first, all recipients are military retirees; second, they are also eligible for VA compensation. This report addresses the two primary components of the concurrent receipt program: Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) and Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments (CRDP). It reviews the possible legislative expansion of the program to additional populations and provides several potential options for Congress to consider. CRSC is for military retirees who have been awarded a Purple Heart or have combat-related disabilities compensable by the VA. CRDP is for those military retirees with service-connected disabilities that have been rated by the Department of Defense (DOD) as being 40% or less of the total VA disability rating. Both CRSC and CRDP are paid from the DOD Military Retirement Fund and are available to all military retirees, regardless of service level. The Blended Retirement System (BRS), effective for all servicemembers joining on or after January 1, 2018, offers a lump sum payment of a portion of retired pay in lieu of a monthly annuity. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that eliminating the CRDP program would save the government $139 billion between 2018 and 2026. While achieving significant cost savings, eliminating or sunsetting concurrent receipt programs could be unpopular among servicemember, veterans, and their families. Some of the factors that Congress might consider regarding potential changes include program costs, program efficiencies, individual eligibility requirements, and interaction with other services' and veterans' benefits and programs. For example, Congress could extend CRSC eligibility to Chapter 61 disability retirees with less than 20 years of service or to those with a 50% or greater VA rating. Congress could also modify or eliminate the special rule that limits CRSC payments to veterans with 20 or more years of military service. In 2014, CBO estimated that to extend benefits to all veterans who would be eligible for both disability benefits and military retirement pay would cost $30 billion from 2015 to 2024. However, some may note that eliminating or modifying this special rule would result in paying for the same disability twice, by DOD and by VA. It might also complicate future initiatives to simplify and streamline postservice compensation whereby DOD would only compensate for years of services and the VA would only compensation for disability, as recommended by the Dole/Shalala commission.
International trophy hunting is a multinational, multimillion-dollar industry practiced in countries on almost every continent. Trophy hunting is broadly defined as the killing of animals for recreation with the purpose of collecting trophies such as horns, antlers, skulls, skins, tusks, or teeth for display. The practice of international trophy hunting, especially of rare and endangered species, has generated controversy for a number of reasons, including its relation to conservation (including of wildlife populations), ethical considerations, and its effect on local economies where the animals are hunted. Proponents of trophy hunting contend that the practice is a potential source of funding for the conservation of species in exchange for the hunting of a proportionally small number of individuals. Further, they argue that trophy hunting can create incentives for conserving habitat and ecosystems where hunted animals roam and, in some impoverished areas in range countries, can provide a means of income, employment, and community development. Critics of trophy Hunting: Some argue that it is unethical to kill animals for sport and that the life of an animal should not be valued according to how much a hunter would pay to kill it. Some also contend that trophy-hunting revenue is a small percentage of overall tourism revenues and a fraction of overall GDP for some of the core wildlife source countries in Africa. They argue in favor of using other alternatives for generating income from natural resources in its stead (e.g., birdwatching and safari). The United States is the largest importer of sport-hunted trophies in the world for all species and for species listed under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). In addition, the United States imports more trophies for CITES-listed species than any other country, and it imports more than 650,000 trophies per year. Some of these trophies are rare and threatened animals hunted in countries throughout Africa and parts of Asia and South America. Some argue, for example, that hunting of African lions, elephants, and rhinoceroses in Africa has contributed to the decline of these species. Some scientists contend that there are no documented extinctions solely resulting from trophy hunting. The killing of Cecil the lion in Africa in 2015 drew particular public interest and attention in Congress. The incident stimulated debate on trophy hunting and raised questions about the relative importance of trophyhunting versus other threats to a species. The Trump Administration has taken some actions that have stimulated congressional interest in the issue, such as establishing an International Wildlife Conservation Council, which is charged with providing advice to the Secretary of the Interior on the benefits of U. S. citizens hunting overseas. This report discusses the history and scope of international trophies and discusses the role of Congress in addressing trophy hunting through legislation and regulations. It also discusses the various international laws and agreements that address trophy hunting in various ways, including the import and export of trophies. The report concludes with a discussion of potential issues for Congress to consider regarding international trophies.
The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are contained in the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. Each clause provides that the government shall not deprive a person of "life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." Due process may be procedural or substantive. Based on the principle of "fundamental fairness," procedural due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before a neutral party. The Due Process Clause requires that governmental action that deprives an individual of life, liberty or property must be implemented in a fair, nonarbitrary manner. The Fifth Amendment applies to actions taken by the federal government, whereas the Fourteen Amendment applies by state governments. Although the Supreme Court has invalidated statutes that impose jail or other adverse consequences based on a defendant's indigence, it has never held that money-bail systems are constitutionally invalid because indigent defendants have greater difficulty paying bail than other criminal defendants. In a series of cases, the Court has held that imprisonment solely because of indigents constitutes invidious discrimination and is constitutionally impermissible. The Court has also held that pretrial detention may have negative consequences for criminal defendants, such as by impairing their ability to maintain employment and to support dependents financially. The impact of state and municipal money- bail systems on indigent criminal defendants has prompted legislative interest in, and judicial challenges to, such systems. The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an amicus brief in a civil rights lawsuit challenging bail amounts based solely on the offense, calling such systems unconstitutional. As of the date of this report, it is unclear whether the DOJ and the Trump Administration will continue to take an active role in this case. This report will be updated as warranted by Supreme Court or lower court decisions.

In March 2011, antigovernment protests broke out in Syria, which has been ruled by the Asad family for more than four decades. The protests spread, violence escalated (primarily but not exclusively by Syrian government forces), and numerous political and armed opposition groups emerged. In August 2011, President Barack Obama called on Syrian President Bashar al Asad to step down. Over time, the rising death toll from the conflict, and the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, intensified pressure for the United States and others to assist the opposition. In 2013, Congress debated lethal and nonlethal assistance to vetted Syrian opposition groups, and authorized the latter. In 2014, the Obama Administration requested authority and funding from Congress to provide lethal support to vetted Syrians for select purposes. The original request sought authority to support vetted Syrians in "defending the Syrian people from attacks by the Russian-backed Syrian regime," but the subsequent advance of the Islamic State organization from Syria across Iraq refocused executive and legislative deliberations on counterterrorism. Congress authorized a Department of Defense-led train and equip program to combat terrorist groups active in Syria and other Syria-based terrorist threats, and to "promote the conditions for a negotiated settlement to end the conflict in Syria." Since 2015, U.S. forces have operated in Syria in support of the counter-IS campaign. In December 2018, President Trump announced the withdrawal of all U. S. forces from Syria, but in February 2019, the White House announced that several hundred troops would remain in Syria. The United States also recognized the Israeli claim to the Golan Heights, a roughly 450-square-mile plateau situated between Israel and Syria, as part of the state of Israel on March 25, 2019. The U.N. Security Council has sponsored peace talks in Geneva since 2012, but it is unclear when (or whether) the parties might reach a political settlement that could result in a transition away from Asad. As of 2019, nearly 12 million people in Syria are in need of humanitarian assistance, 6.2 million are internally displaced, and an additional 5.6 million are registered as refugees in nearby countries. The Trump Administration's Syria policy underwent significant changes in 2018, reflecting an internal policy review as well as apparent differences of opinion between President Trump and senior military and diplomatic officials. In January 2018, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that "the United States will maintain a military presence in Syria focused on ensuring that ISIS cannot re-emerge." However, by May 2018, the Administration had begun to shift away from direct funding of stabilization programs in areas liberated from Islamic State control. The Administration moved to end a range of nonlethal, nonhumanitarian assistance programs for opposition-held communities in southern and northwestern Syria, including those in Idlib province. In July 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis stated that the Administration's military forces were focused on the "last bastions" of opposition-controlled areas in southern Syria. In late 2018, however, the Trump Administration announced that it would begin to withdraw troops from northern Syria in December 2018. In early 2019, President Donald J. Trump announced that the United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2254, adopted in 2015, would provide the framework for a political solution to the Syria conflict. The resolution calls for the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of new elections in Syria that would be supervised by the UN Security Council. Since 2017, Russia, Iran, and Turkey have been hosting peace talks hosted by Russia in the Kazakh capital of Astana, Kazakhstan. These talks were the forum through which three "de-escalation areas" were established—two of which have since been retaken by Syrian military forces. In November 2018, Russia and Turkey began a new round of peace talks, known as the Astana Process, in Astana. In February 2018, Russian President Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held a trilateral summit at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi to discuss the future of Idlib and how to move forward on the formation of a Syrian Constitutional Committee, an initiative stemming from a Russian-led Sochi conference held in January 2018. The Syrian government and opposition have been engaged in political negotiations under the framework of the Geneva Process since 2012. Since the outbreak of the Syria Conflict in 2011, Congress has considered a number of issues related to the conflict. These include the following key issues for Congress:  What are the core U.s. national interests in Syria? What objectives derive from
This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) program, which is carried out by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Navy, and gives Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers a capability for conducting BMD operations. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition strategies and proposed funding levels for the Aeg is BMD program. The Aegis BMD system was originally developed in the 1970s for defending ships against aircraft, anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), surface threats, and subsurface threats. The system was first deployed by the Navy in 1983, and it has been updated many times since. The Navy's Aegis ships include Ticonderoga (CG-47) class cruisers (CGs 47 through 73) and Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class destroyers (Flight I/II DDG- 51s) and Aegis-equipped destroyers and frigates (Aegis ships in Japan, South Korea, Australia, Spain, and Norway). Most of the Navy's ships are called Aegis because they are equipped with the AegIs ship combat system—an integrated collection of sensors, computers, software, displays, weapon launchers, and weapons named for the mythological shield that defended Zeus. A total of 27 CG-47s were procured for the Navy between FY1978 and FY1988; the ships entered service between 1983 and 1994. The first five ships in the class, which were built to an earlier technical standard in certain respects, were judged to be too expensive to modernize and were removed from service in 2004-2005, leaving 22 ships in operation. The next 34 ships, known as Flight IIA DDg-51s, incorporate some design changes, including the addition of a helicopter hangar. No DDG G51s were Procured in FY2006-FY2009. The U.S. Navy during this period instead procured three Zumwalt (DDg-1000) class destroyer destroyers. The DDG1000 design does not use the AegIS system and does not include a capability to conduct BMD operation. Navy plans do not call for modifying the three DDGG-1000s to make them BMD-capable. Procurement of DDG51s resumed in FY2010, following procurement of the threeDDG -1000s. Atotal of 20 DDG -51s have been procured from FY2010-FY2019. Aegis Ships in Allied Navies Aegis sales of the system to allied countries began in the late 1980s. Allied countries that now operate, are building, or are planning to build Aegis equipped ships include Japan,South Korea,Australia, Spain and Norway. Most of Japan's AegIs-equipped ships are currently BMDcapable, and Japan plans to make all of them BMB-cap capable in coming years. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Spain also operate or plan to operate ships with BMD capabilities. The other countries operate destroyers or frigates with different combat systems that may have potential for contributing to B MDM operations. In September 2009, the Obama Administration announced the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) for European BMD. EPAA calls for using BMD ships, a land-based radar in Europe, and two Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland to defend Europe against ballistic missile threats from countries such as Iran. The completion of construction of the Poland site has been delayed by at least a year, MDA says, due to contractor performance issues. The EPAA also calls for the forward-homeporting of four Aegis destroyers at the naval base at Rota, Spain.
The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program is a loan and loan guarantee program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Rural Utilities Service (RUS) that provides grants, loans, or loan guarantees to eligible entities for the construction, improvement, or acquisition of broadband infrastructure in rural areas. The program is intended to accelerate the deployment of broadband services in rural America. Broadband refers to high-speed internet access and advanced telecommunications services for private homes, commercial establishments, schools, and public institutions. Currently in the United States, residential broadband is primarily provided via cable modem (from the local provider of cable television service), fiber-optic cable, mobile wireless (e.g., smartphones), or over the copper telephone line (digital subscriber line or "DSL"). Broadband access enables a number of beneficial applications to individual users and to communities. These include ecommerce, telecommuting, voice service (voice over the internet protocol or "VOIP"), distance learning, telemedicine, public safety, and others. It is becoming generally accepted that broadband access in a community can play an important role in economic development. Access to affordable broadband is viewed as particularly important for the economic development of rural areas because it enables individuals and businesses to participate fully in the online economy regardless of geographical location. The rural broadband industry supported 69,595 jobs in 2015, both through its own employment and the employment that its purchases of goods and services generated. While there are many examples of rural communities with state-of-the-art telecommunications facilities, recent surveys and studies have indicated that, in general, rural areas tend to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment. For example, according to the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) Communications Marketplace Report, "As of year-end 2017, 94% of the overall population had coverage [of fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps], up from 91.9% in 2016. Nonetheless, the gap in rural and Tribal America remains notable: 24% of Americans in rural Areas and 32% of American Indians and Alaskan Natives lack coverage from fixed terrestrial 25 Mbps-3 Mbps broadband, as compared to only 1.5% ofAmericans in urban areas." According to a November 2017 Census Bureau survey reported by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Digital Nation Data Explorer, 72% of rural residents reported using the internet, versus 78.5%. According to NTIA, the data "indicates a fairly constant 6-9 percentage point gap between rural and urban communities' internet use over time." The comparatively lower population density of rural Areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas. Particularly for wireline broadband technologies—such as cable modem, fiber, and DSL—the greater the geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve those customers. Because private providers are unlikely to earn enough revenue to cover the costs of deploying and operating broadband networks in many unserved rural areas, it is unlikely that many rural areas will have access to broadband service in the foreseeable future. In addition, broadband availability issue is the extent to which there are multiple broadband providers offering competition and consumer choice. Typically, multiple, multiple providers are more prevalent in urban than rural areas; thus, there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural area than, for example, in an urban area where there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and less cost to wire the area. The RUS broadband loan program was reauthorized by the Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79) on February 7, 2014, and was made final on June 9, 2016. On July 30, 2015, the RUS published in the Federal Register the interim rule (7 C.F.R. part 1738) implementing the program. The 2018 farm bill, which was signed by the President on December 20, 2018, reauthorizes the broadband loan and grant programs through FY2023. On February 15, 2019, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 was signed into law. The FY2019 appropriations and levels are as follows: Rural broadband access loans—$5.83 million in budget authority to subsidize a broadband loan level of $29.851 million. Telecommunications infrastructure loans and loan Guarantees—$1.725 million to subsidizing direct Treasury loans set at a level
The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) is authorized by statute to be a "wholly owned Government corporation ... under the foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State" in the executive branch. Its purpose is to "mobilize and facilitate the participation of private sector capital and skills in the economic development" of developing and transition countries, in order to complement U. S. development assistance objectives and foreign policy interests. In other words, the IDFC's mission is to promote private investment in support of both U. s. global development goals and U.s. economic interests. The IDFC is to consolidate and expand existing development finance functions—currently conducted primarily by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and certain elements of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)—and is to take on the role of a development finance institution (DFI). OPIC has been the primary DFI since the 1970s. In FY2017, OPIC reported authorizing $3.8 billion in new commitments for 112 projects, and its exposure reached a record high of $23.2 billion. OPIC currently has $5 billion invested in the Indo-Pacific in projects to expand access to energy, education, and financial services, as well as to support local farmers. The BUILD Act (H.R. 5105, S. 2320) was enacted on October 5, 2018, as Division F of a law to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (P.L. 115-254). The act established the new IDFC as a successor entity to OPIC, taking over all of OPIC's functions and authorities and adding new ones, including the authority to make loans and guarantees and to take minority equity positions in investments, subject to limitations. In addition, the act provides the authority for, but does not require, the transfer of USAID's Office of Private Capital and Microenterprise, the existing USAID-managed enterprise funds, and the sovereign loan guarantee portfolio. The disposition of these functions is to be detailed in the reorganization plan that the Administration must submit to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The plan is expected to be submitted by early February 2019. The President must consult with Congress on the plan not less than 15 days before the date on which the plan is transmitted, and before making any material modification or revision to the plan before it becomes operational. During the transition period, both OPIC and USAID are to continue to perform their existing functions. Thus, theIDFC could become operational as early as summer 2019 based on this timeline, and OPIC anticipates that it could be operational as of October 1, 2019. At that time, the Office of the President and Congress will be terminated and its enabling legislation will be repealed. In February 2018, two proposed versions of the BUILT Act were introduced in the House and Senate, both of which would have created a new IDFIC. The House-passed version (July 17, 2018; H.Rept. 115, 115-814) and Senate committee-reported version (June 27, 2018) bridged some differences, including both providing a seven-year authorization. On September 26,2018, the House adopted a resolution ( H.Res. 1082) to pass theBUILD Act as part of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. The Senate followed with its passage of the bill on October 3, 2018 (S. 2463). The President signed the bill into law the following day, with Division F.
The War Powers Resolution was enacted to ensure that the President and Congress share decisions where U.S. troops may become involved in hostilities. This sharing of power has often resulted in controversy, particularly when troops are sent into situations where there has not been a formal declaration of war. In three instances, Congress has authorized the use of military force in advance of hostilities: the Persian Gulf War (1991), military operations in Afghanistan (2001), and the "use of force against Iraq" resolution (2002). In each case, however, the President has maintained that while he may have sought congressional consultation and support, he has the constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to use force, including the Armed Forces of the United States, to protect national security interests. Congress, while not authorizing directly, and in advance, this military action, introduced and voted on several legislative measures related to deployment of U. S. military forces for combat or peacekeeping in the Balkan region. The House adopted H.Con.Res. 42 on March 11, 1999, which authorized the President to send troops as peacekeepers, and the Senate passed a non-binding resolution on March 23, 1999. However, the House later defeated the Senate resolution. Other House or Senate votes sent conflicting signals in addressing funding related to troop deployments in the region, declaring of war issues, and executive and congressional roles in sending U.N. peacekeepers and military forces abroad. This report describes the congressional debate that often surrounds the issue of employing the military abroad. Initially written in response to a congressional request for a list of votes on this topic from 1982-1992, this report has been updated as needed since that time. The floor votes included are those directly related to the use and funding of troops abroad, often in the context of the War Powers resolution, or to their continued presence or withdrawal. The laws, bills, and resolutions below are listed in the chronological order of the votes that were held. Links to the actual roll call votes are provided, when available (since 1990 in the House and 1989 in the Senate). These links include each Member's yea or nay vote.

The Agriculture appropriations bill—formally known as the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act—funds all of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA, excluding the Forest Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and, in even-numbered fiscal years, CFTC. It also funds the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in HHS. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported FY2019 Agriculture appropriations bills (H.R. 5961 on May 16, 2018, and S. 2976 on May 24, 2018). The Senate amended and passed its version as Division C of a four-bill minibus on August 1, 2018. In January 2019, during the partial government shutdown, the House passed various combinations of agriculture appropriations bills in an attempt to reopen the government. The Senate did not consider the measures until the Consolidated Appropriations Act moved in February 2019. On February 15, 2019, Congress passed and the President signed the FY2019 Consolidated appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6, H.Rept.116-9). The agriculture portion is Division B of the act. The official discretionary total of the Agriculture appropriation is $23.03 billion, which is $35 million more (+0.2%) than was enacted for FY2018 on a comparable basis that excludes the CFTC from the FY2018 total (Table 2). On that same comparable basis, the enacted total is $6.3 billion more than the Administration requested (+38%), $55 million more than was proposed in the House-reported bill (+ 0.2%), but $194 million less than in the Senate-passed bill (-0.8%). The appropriation also carries mandatory spending that totals nearly $129 billion. Thus, the overall total for FY2019 is about $152 billion. The Administration's FY2019 budget request proposed a 25% reduction from FY2018 for accounts in the jurisdiction of the agriculture appropriations bill, to $17 billion, a reduction of $1.5 billion. In the absence of a final FY2019 agriculture appropriation at the end of FY2018, Congress enacted three continuing resolutions (CRs) to continue government operations. The first CR was from October 1,2018, through December 7, 2018 (P-L. 115-245, Division C). The second CR continued temporary funding through December 21, 2018; a 34-day funding gap (partial government shutdown) occurred between the second and third CRs. To end the shutdown, a third CR was enacted to cover the period from January 26, 2019 through February 15. The third CR, which extended funding for the remainder of the fiscal year, was signed into law on January 16, 2019. In general, a CR continues the funding rates and conditions that were in the previous year's appropriation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may prorate funding to the agencies on an annualized basis for the duration of the CR through a process known as apportionment. Five anomalies specifically applied to the agriculture appropriation during the CRs: Child Nutrition Pro grams: apportioning for a summer foods program that allowed it to be operational by May 2019;    Rural Utilities Service: allowed a loan authorization level for the Rural Water and Waste Disposal program of $4.141 billion (Section 115); Commodities Credit Corporation (CCC): allowed CCC to receive its appropriation to reimburse the Treasury for a line of credit about a month earlier than usual, prior to a customary final report and audit. Many farm bill payments to farmers were due in October 2018 in addition to USDA's plan to make supplemental payments under a trade assistance program. Without the anomaly, CCC might have exhausted its $30 billion line of credits. Agricultural Research Service: provided an additional $42 million for operations and maintenance at the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) being built in Manhattan, Kansas, and its transfer to USDA from theDepartment of Homeland Security (Section 117). Department of Homeland security (DHS) : allowed DHS to transfer up to $15 million to USDA to support NBAF operations (Section 125).
To ensure that Members of Congress uphold high standards, the U.S. Constitution provides sole authority to establish rules and punish and expel Members to the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively. Article I, Section 5, clause 2 provides that "Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member. " In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Senate used its authority to set ethics rules and to punish individual Members sparingly. Former Senate historian Richard Baker observed that "[f]or nearly two centuries, a simple and informal code of behavior existed. Prevailing norms of general decency served as the chief determinants of proper legislative conduct. " During that time, Congress often dealt with ethics issues "on a case-by-case basis, [and then] only with the most obvious acts of wrongdoing, those clearly 'inconsistent with the trust and duty of a member. '" Events in the early 1960s, including charges of corruption and influence peddling against Secretary to the Majority Robert G. "Bobby" Baker, prompted the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which had jurisdiction over "[m]atters relating to the payment of money out of the contingent fund of the Senate or creating a charge upon the same," to hold hearings on financial and business activities of current and former Members, officers, and employees of the House and Senate. Following the hearings, the committee recognized that serious allegations had been made against a former employee, and that no specific rules or regulations governed the duties and activities of Members, officer, or employees ofthe Senate. The committee also concluded that many of Baker's outside activities were in conflict with his official duties and made several recommendations, including adoption of public financial disclosure rules and other guidelines for Senate employees. In the 88th Congress (1963-1964), the Senate created the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct to investigate allegations of improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate; investigate violations of laws, rules, and regulations of the chamber; recommend disciplinary action, when appropriate; and recommend additional Senate rules to insure proper conduct. In 1968, after several days of debate, the House adopted a resolution (S.Res. 36) to establish a formal code of conduct for the Senate. In 1977, after the Senate had agreed to the recommendations of a select committee on official conduct, a Senate committee was established to study the Senate Code of Official Conduct. In 1978, following the passage of the Ethics in Government Act (P.L. 95-105) and the establishment of the Committee on Ethics in the 95th Congress, the select committee was given jurisdiction over the acceptance of foreign gifts, the use of the franking privilege, the disclosure of intelligence information, the administration of public disclosure forms, and the enforcement of fair employment practices. In 2007, pursuant to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, several provisions were amended, including placing restrictions on former Senators and senior staff who become federally registered lobbyists; requiring disclosure by Senators and staff of post-employment job negotiations; implementing protections against Senators from influencing hiring decisions based on political affiliation; and amending the Senate gift rules. In 2012, the STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act) was passed to affirm that no exemption exists from "insider trading" laws and regulations for Members and congressional employees. Pursuant to the act, the selected committee is required to issue interpretive guidance of the relevant rules of each chamber, including rules on conflicts of interest and gifts.
The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193). It replaced the program of cash assistance for needy families that dated back to the New Deal, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and some of its related programs. The enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law was the culmination of a debate about how to overhaul programs providing cash assistance to needy families with children—specifically, those headed by single mothers—that spanned four decades: from the 1960s to the 1990s. The 1996 welfare law provided both program authority and funding (appropriations) for TANF through the end of FY2002. Most of the legislative activity since 2002 has been to extend the program funding and financing authority for the block grant. The most recent extension was in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P. l. 109-171, enacted February 8, 2006). The DRA extended funding through FY2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.l. 111-5) included $5 billion for a new Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) to reimburse states for increased costs associated with the Great Recession for FY2009 and FY2010, and for FY2011. The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (CRA) extended TANf funding through June 30, 2011, and the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (middle class tax relief and job creation) extended it through September 30, 2012. The FY2013 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 4), enacted January 14, 2013, provided $612 million for the ECF for FY2013 and FY2014. The Protect Our Kids Act of 2013, enacted in January 2013, appropriated $612.5 million to the ECFs and reserved $2 million from each of the two years' appropriations for the activities of a commission to examine child welfare fatalities. The Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (Welfare reform) Act, enacted March 26, 2014, extended funding for the EICP for the remainder of FY2013. The TANFservice Extension Act of 2015, enacted December 16, 2015, provided funding through December 17, 2015. The Temporary Assistance to Needy families block grant has been extended several times since its enactment, most recently in the FY2017 Consolidated appropriations act (P-L. 115-31, enacted May 5, 2017). The TanF extension act of 2019, enacted January 24, 2019, extended the block grants' funding for FY2019. This report will begin with a brief overview of the history of the AFDC program. That overview will be followed by a summary of the changes made since 1996. The report concludes with a detailed chronology of TAP legislation.
Since 1978, the federal government has entered into 36 water rights settlements with 40 individual Indian tribes. These settlements are a means of resolving ongoing disputes related to Indian water rights between tribes, federal and state governments, and other parties (e.g., water rights holders). The federal government is involved in these settlements pursuant to its tribal trust responsibilities. Many of these settlements have been authorized by Congress to provide funding for projects that allow tribes to access and develop their water resources. At issue for Congress is not only the new settlements completing negotiations but also how well the current process for negotiating and recommending settlements for authorization is working. Some of the challenges raised by these settlements pertain to satisfying the federal trust responsibility related to tribal water rights, the provision of federal funding associated with these settlements, and the principles and expectations guiding ongoing and future negotiation of new settlements and renegotiation of past settlements. Since 1990, there have been 21 ongoing negotiation teams working on settlements projected to cost more than $2 billion. Additionally, there are 23 implementation teams active for carrying out approved settlements. Overall, Congress has enacted 32 of the 36 settlements since 1978, and 4 have been approved administratively by the Secretary of the Interior or the U.S. Attorney General or judicially by judicial decree. As of the end of the 115th Congress, 32 settlements had been enacted and 4 had been authorized administratively. In addition to providing access to water, most settlements have resulted in tribal development funds into which the Department of the interior makes scheduled payments for the purpose of economic development and to cover various costs of managing water projects. In many cases, settlements have also authorized conditions for water marketing and leasing for tribes, although the degree to which this is allowed varies by settlement. In recent Congresses, legislation has been introduced that would authorize new settlements, authorize funding for existing settlements, or provide additional funding for future settlements. For example, the Indian Water Settlements Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-11) authorized $1.2 billion in mandatory and discretionary funding to be used to implement a water rights settlement agreement approved by Congress that resolves, in whole or in part, litigation involving the United States, and it may be used if the settlement agreement or implementing legislation requires Reclamation to provide financial assistance for or to plan, design, or construct a water project. This report provides background on Indian water right settlements and an overview of the settlement process. It also analyzes issues related to the federal role in negotiating and implementing these settlements. Finally, it focuses on settlements in a legislative context, including enacted and proposed legislation.
The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) is an Army-led, multiservice initiative to develop a family of future light tactical vehicles to replace many of the High Mobility, Multi-Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) used by the armed services today. The JLTV program is a joint Army/Marine Corps effort to develop and produce both vehicles and associated trailers. It is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program. In December 2007, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics USD (AT&L) directed the Army and Marines to move from the Concept Refinement Phase into the Technology Development (TD) Phase of the DOD System Acquisition Process. On February 5, 2008, an RFP for Technology Development Phase was issued to industry. The RFP stated the government desired to award three contracts for the TD Phase for a total of $166 million. The three contracts were awarded on October 28, 2008. In November 2008, two of the contracts were protested by the Northrop Grumman-Oshkosh team and the Textron-Boeing-SAIC team alleging there were "unintended discrepancies" in how the government rated bids in terms of the criteria of systems maturity, logistics, and costs. As a result of that protest, work on the program by the three winning teams was suspended. In February 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) rejected the protests and the stop-work orders were lifted. On January 26, 2012, the Army issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the program. The Army awarded three firm-fixed price EMD contracts totaling approximately $185 million to AM General, Lockheed Martin, and Oshkosh in August 2012. The contracts were for 27 months, with each contractor receiving initial funding between $28 million and $36 million per contractor, with the balance of funding up to the full contract amount being provided in FY2013 and FY2014. In 12 months, each team was required to deliver 22 prototypes and contractor support for a 14-month comprehensive government testing program, which included blast, automotive, and user evaluation testing. The overall EMD Phase was scheduled to last 33 months. Unsuccessful bidders Navistar Defense, BAE Systems, and General Tactical Vehicles (a team of General Dynamics and AM General) were permitted to continue developing JLVs candidate vehicles at their own risk and expense, if they notified the government within 30 days of the EMD contract award. On August 25, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) awarded a $6.7 billion low rate initial production (LRIP) contract with eight options to procure the initial 16,901 vehicles. A full rate production decision was planned for FY2018, and called for the production of 49,100 vehicles for the Army, and 5,500 for the Marine Corps. On March 14, 2019, it was reported the Army planned to buy 1,900 fewer JLTCs than originally planned, reducing program funding by nearly $800 million over the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). The Army's decision to reduce its overall requirement to free up funding for modernization raises potential issues for Congress. With the Army reportedly suggesting it has more light tactical vehicle capability than it needs with existing High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles and Infantry Squad Vehicles (ISVs), questions could arise as to the accuracy of the Army's original JL TV requirements process. Other questions could also arise as well: With a revised overall JL television requirement, what is the Armys new fielding plan to units? With fewer J LTVs to be fielded, what are the overall operational impact to the force? With an overall J lTV reduction, will the Army’s Reserve Components receive fewer J littoral combat vehicles (JLCs) than planned? Finally, will this new revised J lttv requirement be final, or is it possible the Army might again reduce overall JlTV requirements to free-up funding for other higher-priority programs? This report will be updated as events warrant.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the internet and, in particular, the use of social media are among the key "factors [that] have contributed to the evolution of the terrorism threat landscape" since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Certain organizations that track or study hate crimes also cite the internet as a tool used to intimidate and harass people because of their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or other attributes. At the same time, some commentators have questioned the purported link between what some refer to as "hate speech" and bias-motivated crimes or have expressed concern that focusing on the ideological motivations of speakers has led to calls to criminalize protected speech divorced from any criminal intent or action. Speech advocating violence and terrorism is prohibited by the terms of service of Facebook, Twitter, and certain other social media outlets. Such prohibitions are permissible under current judicial interpretations of First Amendment law because these platforms are operated by private actors, and the First Amendment constrains only state (i.e., government) action. Although the more established sites reportedly have increased their efforts to disable accounts that are associated with terrorist groups or remove content promoting terrorism or violence, it is not clear how comprehensive or successful these efforts have been. Moreover, users banned from one platform may move to another online forum that does not have the same restrictions, sometimes finding a community of like-minded individuals who reinforce or escalate their violent rhetoric. Because of the global reach of many online platforms, this report begins with the threshold question of the first Amendment's reach, and in particular whether it applies to foreign nationals posting online content from outside of the United States. The Supreme Court has not directly opined on the applicability of free speech protections to online content that a foreign national posts while located abroad, but the Court's decisions involving the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections, as well as lower court decisions involving First Amendment rights of foreign nationals, suggest that foreign nationals may face barriers in claiming First Amendment protections for such speech. A key initial consideration in evaluating whether a law or a particular application of that law comports with the FirstAmendment protections is whether the law at issue regulates conduct or speech. The distinction is sometimes elusive because speech may occur during a course of conduct, and actions themselves can sometimes be inherently expressive or "symbolic" speech protected by the First amendment. As a potential starting point, a law typically regulates conduct if it dictates what the regulated persons or entities "must [or must not] do." However, the conduct-focused nature of a law does not necessarily preclude First Amendment review where the government seeks to penalize a person under that law because of ideas or messages that the person communicated. The Court applied these principles in its 2010 decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, which involved the constitutionality of a federal statute concerning the provision of material support to U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs). The statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who "knowingly provides material support or resources to [an FTO], or attempts or conspires to do so." It defines "material support" in relevant part as "any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including training, expert advice or assistance, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, personnel (1 or more individuals who may be or include oneself) . . . , except medicine or religious materials." In a preenforcement challenge to the law, a group of U. S. citizens and domestic organizations argued that it would be unconstitutional to punish them for the types of support that they wished to provide to two FTOs. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought to (1) train members of one FTO on how to use humanitarian and international law in peaceful dispute resolution; (2) teach that FTO's members how to petition international organizations for relief; and (3) engage in political advocacy for the rights of certain groups, including by supporting a FTO "as a political organization" for this purpose. After concluding that most of these activities clearly constituted "training" or "expert advice and assistance" under the statute, the Court proceeded to address the constitutional implications of applying the statute to the plaintiffs' activities. On the one hand, it rejected the plaintiffs contention that the statute banned their "pure political speech," noting that the law did not prevent the plaintiffs from becoming members of the FTOs, speaking and writing freely about these organizations, or engaging in independent
Congress created offices of inspector general (OIGs) in 1978 (via P.L. 95-452, the Inspector General Act of 1978, or the IG Act) to assist in its oversight of the executive branch. OIGs were designed to provide Congress and federal agency heads independent, nonpartisan analysis, conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, to identify and recommend ways to limit waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs and enhance operational and program efficiency and effectiveness. They currently exist in more than 70 federal agencies, including all departments and larger agencies, numerous boards and commissions, and other entities. They are predominantly located in executive branch agencies, but several legislative branch entities—for example, the Library of Congress (LOC), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and the Government Publishing Office (GPO)—also have O IGs. The overwhelming majority of OIG's, including the U.S. Small Business Administration OIG (SBA OIG), are governed by the IG act. It structures inspector general appointments and removals, powers and authorities, and duties and responsibilities. The IG Act provides IGs with a separate appropriations account, known colloquially as a "line item," for their offices. This provision prevents federal administrators from limiting, transferring, or otherwise reducing OIG funding once it has been specified in law. IGs are authorized to transmit a budget estimate and request to their respective agency head each fiscal year. Each IG's request must include amounts for operations, training, and for the support of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE). The agency's budget request to the President must include the IG's original budget request and any comments the affected IG has regarding the proposal. The President's budget must include in the Administration's budget submission to Congress the President's original request; the amount requested by the President for the OIG for the office's operations and training and support for CIGIE; and any comment the IG has on the proposal if the IG concludes that the proposal would substantially inhibit the IG from performing the duties of the office. Each year, the SBA O IG transmits a budget justification document to the SBI Administrator, which is available online. That document includes the S BA OIGs budget request, an overview of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Office of Inspector General (OMB) and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) oversight activities during the previous fiscal year, areas of emphasis for the coming fiscal year (such as the number of reports and recommendations issued, estimated amounts saved or recouped, and number of indictments and convictions), and a table of statistical highlights and accomplishments for the previous year. The OIG is also required to submit semiannual reports to the agency head, summarizing its activities for the immediately preceding six-month periods ending on March 31 and September 30 of each year. In addition, pursuant to the Records Consolidation Act of 2000, the OMB Circular A-136, and P. L. 106-531, and the Records consolidation act of 2000 (P.L., 106-631), the OPM OIG issues an annual Report on the Most Serious Management and Performance Challenges Facing the SSA. This report is, arguably, the Office's signature oversight document, focusing attention "on areas that are particularly vulnerable to fraud, waste, error, and mismanagement, or that otherwise pose a significant risk and generally have been subject to one or more OIG or GAO reports." The SBA's OIG reports that its audits and investigations resulted in monetary savings and recoveries of nearly $224.5 million in FY2018 ($55.4 million from potential investigative recoveries and fines, $22.9 million from asset forfeitures, $0.73 million for loans or contracts not approved or canceled, and $145.4million in disallowed costs agreed to by management). The report concludes with some observations concerning the officeincluding its impact on monetary savings, SBA programs and operations, and legislation affecting the agency.
NAFTA is an international trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico that became effective on January 1, 1994. The agreement includes market-opening provisions that remove tariff and nontariff barriers to trade, as well as other rules affecting trade in areas such as agriculture, customs procedures, foreign investment, government procurement, intellectual property protection, and trade in services. The United States approved NAFTA as a congressional-executive agreement by a majority vote of each house of Congress, rather than as a treaty ratified by the President after Senate approval by a two-thirds majority vote. It was not a self-executing agreement; rather, implementing legislation was required to provide domestic legal authorities with the power to enforce and comply with the agreement's provisions. On May 18, 2017, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Robert Lighthizer notified Congress that the Administration intended to renegotiate NAFTA. After more than a year of negotiations, President Trump signed a proposed replacement for NAFTA on June 30, 2018, along with his counterparts from Canada and Mexico. The new agreement addressed a variety of issues, including changes to rules of origin for automotive trade; intellectual property rights protections; digital trade; limitations on the scope of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions; and certain provisions on agricultural trade. President Trump has at times suggested that he will withdraw the United states from NAFTA unilaterally if Congress does not approve the USMCA. NAFTA is a legally binding agreement under international law. Part V of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Vienna Convention), which theUnited States has not ratified but considers to reflect, in many aspects, customary international law, provides rules for withdrawal of a party from a binding international agreement. The Vienna Convention provides that "termination of a treaty or the withdrawal of the party may take place in conformity with the provisions of the treaty . . . ." Article 2205 of NAFTA, which Congress approved in the NAFTA Implementation Act, provides that a "Party may withdraw from this Agreement six months after it provides written notice of withdrawal to the other Parties. If a Party withdraws, the Agreement shall remain in force for the remaining Parties." However, the Vienna convention does not provide for the President to withdraw from a treaty without the advice and consent of the Senate, and it is unclear whether the President has the constitutional authority to unilaterally withdraw from NAFTA without congressional approval. The President could terminate NAFTA without first seeking congressional approval if Congress has already given the Executive such authorization either expressly or by implication. Congress has enacted a detailed statutory framework for the negotiation, legislative consideration, and implementation of free trade agreements under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures. During the past few decades, Congress and the President have used this legal framework to conclude and implement 14 trade agreements with 20 countries, including NAFTA. Given this extensive framework for legislative approval and implementation, a court might find it unlikely that Congress implicitly authorized the President, or even explicitly authorized the Executive, to unilaterally terminate NAFTA obligations without further congressional action. Nonetheless, some commentators have argued that Congress has specifically authorized the Administration to terminate U. S. international obligations under NAFTA. In particular, Section 125(a) of the Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes withdrawal from trade agreements at the end of a period specified in the agreement, has been interpreted by some as authorizing the President's unilateral withdrawal from NAFTA. The text and legislative history of Section 125 suggest that Congress intended to provide the President with broad authority to terminate various presidential proclamations implementing a trade agreement in domestic law and to impose trade barriers in order to, for example, respond to a breach of the agreement by another party. In addition, Section 301 of the trade agreement implementing legislation, which, among other things, sets up the procedure for Congress's consideration of trade agreement implementation legislation, appears to authorize the Executive to suspend or terminate individual trade concessions while the agreement remains in effect. Although Congress has not enacted a resolution or legislation disapproving of unilateral NAFTA termination, either (1) the President must possess plenary constitutional authority, or (2) Congress must have authorized him to take such action through legislation. This report will be updated as events warrant.
In academic year (AY) 2017-2018, 6,700 institutions of higher education (IHEs), enrolling over 27 million postsecondary education students in AY2016-2017, participated in the federal student aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA; P.L. 89-329, as amended). Most of these IHEs operate from year to year with few severe financial or operational concerns; however, each year, a few do face such concerns, which may cause them to cease or significantly curtail operations. The recent closure of multiple large, proprietary (or private, for-profit) I HEs has brought into focus the extent to which a postsecondary student's education may be disrupted by a school closure. However, even in instances of a small IHE's closure, student concerns remain the same. Concerns include the following, among others: Can they continue their postsecondaryEducation at another school? How will they finance future postsecondary educational pursuits? Are they liable for repaying loans they may have borrowed to pursue a post secondary credential that they were unable to obtain because of a school's closure? This report provides an explanation of the options a student may pursue in the event the IHE he or she attends closes, any financial relief that may be available to such students, and other practical implications for students following a school’s closure. First, this report describes the academic options available to students, such as participating in a teach-out or transferring to a new IHE. Next, it discusses issues related to financing a post tertiary education, including the extent that borrowers may have any loans borrowed to finance educational expenses discharged due to a schoolclosure and whether future financial assistance, including federal student loans, Pell Grants, and GI educational benefits, may beavailable to students should they decide to continue their education at another IHE after a school closes. This report then describes additional relief to students who attended a school that closed, including whether they may be eligible for a loan discharge, a borrower defense to repayment (BDR) to repayment, and the potential to have tuition paid reimbursed through a state tuition recovery fund. Finally, the report describes some potential income tax consequences for students when their IHE has closed. Students may incur a federal income tax liability for loans discharged and whether higher education tax credits remain available to them in future years. The Appendix provides a list of abbreviations used in this report. A school closure or the discharge of a student loan may also result in state tax consequences. Most states use the Internal Revenue Code's (IRC's) definition of income as the starting point for computing state income tax liabilities. As such, to the extent a borrower must pay federal income taxes on the discharged debt or account for previously claimed federal education tax benefits, the borrower may be taxed at the state level as well.
Federal law houses hundreds of offenses punishable by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. Although only a handful of these mandatory minimum offenses are prosecuted with any regularity, drug trafficking offenses accounted for over two-thirds of the total. Congress has created three procedures that make punishment for these offenses a little less mandatory. One, the so-called safety valve (18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), permits a sentencing court to disregard a statutory minimum sentence for the benefit of a low-level, nonviolent, cooperative defendant with a minimal prior criminal record, convicted under several mandatory minimum controlled substance offenses. Another, the substantial assistance provision, allows a sentencing judge to reduce a defendant's sentence below the statutory minimum if the defendant provides substantial assistance to the government. The third, Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, authorizes a court to impose a sentence below an otherwise applicable mandatory minimum for substantial assistance only after sentencing. The safety valve is available to qualified offenders convicted of violations of the drug trafficking, simple possession, attempt, or conspiracy provisions of the Controlled Substance or Controlled Substances Import and Export acts. It is not available to those convicted of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, even though the act proscribes conduct closely related to the smuggling and trafficking activities outlawed in the act.

There are many forms of school choice and mechanisms used to facilitate choice, including intradistrict and interdistrict public school choice, public charter schools, magnet schools, vouchers, tax credits/deductions, education savings accounts (ESAs), and homeschooling. School choice efforts in some of these areas are supported by federal programs, such as the programs to support public charter and magnet schools that are authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The most controversial issues regarding publicly funded school choice have involved the provision of direct or indirect support to enable students to attend private schools, especially religiously affiliated private schools. The District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program (DC OSP) is the only federally funded voucher program in the United States. The DC OSP was established under the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, which was included in P.L. 108-199. Appropriations were initially authorized for FY2004 through FY2008. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). The FY2004 appropriations act provided funding for the Washington Scholarship Fund (WSF) for the first time and also, for thefirst time, provided funding to District ofColumbia Public Schools (DCPS) for improvement of public education, and funding to the District of Columbian State Education Office (SEO) for charter schools. While concerns were raised during consideration of the DC school choice legislation, the federal government has also provided funds to support school improvement in DC public schools and DC charter schools for each year that the DCOSP has been funded. The Washington scholarship program has been reauthorized twice. It was first reauthorized by the SOAR Act as authorized under Division C of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P. l. 112-10). The SOAR Reauthorization Act, 2012, amended the law and extended the authorization of appropriations for the program through FY2019. For FY2019, $52.5 million was appropriated for each of the three parts of the program, with $17.4 million provided for DCPS and $3.2 million for DC charter school improvement. The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2019 on February 6, 2019 (P.-L. 116-6). The President also signed the State, Local Government, Accountability, and Readiness Act of 2019 (S.Rept. 115-31) on February 7, 2019, which reauthorized the program and extended its authorization through FY2020. Many of the provisions included in the so-called "SOAR Act" continue to be reflected in current law. For example, the law requires the Secretary of Education to conduct an evaluation of the academic achievement of all participating eligible students in grades 3-8 and at one grade at the high school level. The law also requires that the Secretary ensure that the evaluation is conducted "using the strongest possible research design" to determine the effectiveness of the opportunity scholarship program. In addition, it requires the evaluation to evaluate the safety of the schools attended by participating students and schools in DC attended by students in the comparison group, based on the perceptions of students and parents, and assess student academic achievement at participating private schools in which 85% of the total number of students enrolled in the school are opportunity scholarship recipients. This report provides a detailed discussion of the legislative history and current requirements related to the program. It also includes a brief discussion of some of the issues that have arisen in the program's evaluation. The report concludes with an examination of student and private school participation in the DC O SP. The last section of the report examines the potential costs associated with discontinuing the program at the local level. Several appendices are also included. The first appendix provides information on scholarship use ( appendix A). This is followed by appendices that provide information on private school participants and the impact evaluation reports ( appendix B) and a summary of the evaluation findings ( appendix C).
The United States is unique among "presidential" republics by providing an indirect election to choose its chief executive. The President and Vice President of the United States are selected not by registered voters, but by the electoral college, electors appointed in the states "in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... " Since its founding in 2006, the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative has promoted an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively establish direct popular election of the President and vice President without a constitutional amendment, while retaining the structure of the electoralcollege system. The NPV initiative is based on the premise that the current electoral college system is undemocratic because it does not provide for direct democratic election, that less-populous states are afforded an arithmetical advantage due to the assignment of two electors to each state, regardless of population, and that the winner-take-all system makes it possible for candidates to win an electoral college majority and the presidency, while gaining fewer votes than their principal opponents in the popular election. NPV advocates assert that the interstate compact would provide de facto for a single, democratic choice, allowing all the nation's voters to choose the President directly, with no intermediaries. The "people's choice," they assert, would win in every election, and every vote would carry the same weight in the election, no matter where in the nation it was cast. They maintain that presidential and vice presidential nominees and their organizations would need to spread their presence and resources more evenly as they campaigned for every vote nationwide, rather than concentrate on winning key "battleground" states. They assert that, under the present system, candidates have no reason to poll, visit, organize, campaign, or worry about the concerns of voters of states that they cannot possibly win or lose. They also maintain that the concentration of campaign resources, advertising, and candidate appearances in battleground states depresses turnout in "flyover" states, where candidates make few campaign appearances. They further argue that the disparity in participation may ultimately damage the ability to govern on the state and local levels and could have a negative impact on the legitimacy of public institutions: Diminished voter turnout in presidential races in non-batt battleground states weakens down-ballot candidates, thereby making the state even less competitive in the future. In general, NPV supporters assert that if Congress were to approve the NPV compact, it would provide for the election of a President who won a plurality of the popular vote in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and the President-elect would be elected by a majority of electoral votes in each state. Opponents of the compact argue that it is unconstitutional or "anticonstitutional," that is, contrary to the Founders' intentions and the spirit of the Constitution. They contend that it violates one of the basic principles of majoritarian democracy: it would not require that candidates win a majority in order to gain the presidency. In addition, they assert that NPV would solve few of the system's alleged problem issues and would create some of its own. They note that the compact would be subject to congressional approval, and thus would require only a majority vote in both houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states to go into effect. To date, however, no electoral college reform proposal has met these requirements. This report provides a brief background on the history and evolution of the current presidential election system, analyzes some of the salient features of the contemporary system, and analyzes the current status of NPV in 2019. The report concludes with a brief discussion of the issues raised by the presidential elections of 2000 and 2016, and a discussion of current issues related to NPV.

In January 2006, the 109th Congress enacted the first in a series of legislative provisions to enable certain Iraqi and Afghan nationals to become U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs) based on their service to the United States. Section 1059 of the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) made certain Iraqis and Afghans who had worked directly with the U. S. Armed Forces for at least one year as translators, and their spouses and children, eligible for special immigrant visas (SIVs). Special immigrants comprise a category of permanent employment-based admissions under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The INA also authorizes a separate category of humanitarian admissions for individuals who are unwilling or unable to return to their home country "because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion." Under the INA, a refugee is a person who is unable or unwilling to return home to his or her home country because of persecution, persecution, or persecution of any kind. Refugees are subject to special rules with respect to federal public benefits, such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for the Aged, Blind and Disabled. Special immigrants, like refugees, are eligible for the same resettlement assistance, entitlement programs, and other benefits as refugees and for thesame periods of time. There is a fundamental tension in the administration of the Iraqi and Afghans SIV programs between a sense of urgency to issue visas in a timely fashion to eligible individuals and a need to conduct appropriate security screening. This tension is quite sharp because on the one hand these programs are aimed at individuals who assisted the UnitedStates and face danger because of it, and on the other hand there are serious concerns that this population may pose security threats. The SIV program for Iraqi and Afghanistan translators and interpreters is ongoing, while the programs for Iraqis and Afghanistan who worked for, or on behalf of, the U.-S. government are temporary. As of the date of this report, the temporary Afghan program and the temporary Iraqi program are scheduled to end when all the available visas are issued. There seems to be broad agreement that the United United States should admit for permanent residence Iraqis and Afghan who have assisted the government overseas, provided that they do not pose security risks. Given the seeming consensus that the government should assist its employees in need, an ongoing question for Congress is whether the existing SIV provisions are sufficient to accomplish this, or whether further extensions of the temporary SIV systems, or other changes to the SIV system, are warranted. This report will be updated as warranted.
Medicare is a federal insurance program that pays for covered health care services of most individuals aged 65 and older and certain disabled persons. The Medicare program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and individuals enroll in Medicare through the Social Security Administration (SSA). Medicare consists of four parts—Parts A through D. Part A covers hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services; Part B covers a broad range of medical services and supplies, including physician services, laboratory services, durable medical equipment, and outpatient hospital services. Part C (Medicare Advantage) provides private plan options, such as managed care, for beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Part A and Part B. Part D provides optional outpatient prescription drug coverage. Each part of Medicare is funded differently. Parts A is financed primarily through payroll taxes imposed on current workers (2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers), which are credited to the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund. Parts B and D, the voluntary portions, are funded through the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Funds, which are financed primarily by general revenues (transfers from the U.S. Treasury) and premiums paid by enrollees. Beneficiaries generally do not pay premiums for Part A. In 2019, total Part A expenditures are expected to reach about $328 billion, representing about 41% of program costs. In 2018, the Medicare Part B premium was about $135.50 per month. Part B beneficiary premiums are normally set at a rate each year equal to 25% of average expected per capita Part B program costs for the aged for the year. Higher-income enrollees pay higher premiums set to cover a greater percentage of Part B costs, while those with low incomes may qualify for premium assistance through one of several Medicare Savings Programs administered by Medicaid. Individuals who receive Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) retirement or disability benefits have their Part B premiums automatically deducted from their benefit checks. In addition to premiums, Part B beneficiaries may pay other out-of-pocket costs when they use services. For example, those enrolled in Medicare Advantage may have their premiums paid for by their state Medicaid program. For these individuals, Medicaid covers the majority of Medicare premium and cost-sharing expenses, and it supplements Medicare by providing coverage for services not covered under Medicare. In cases where services are covered by both Medicare and Medicaid, Medicare pays first and Medicaid picks up most of the remaining costs. Medicare beneficiaries who do not meet their respective state's eligibility criteria for Medicaid may still qualify for assistance with premiums if they have incomes of less than 135% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and assets less than $7,730 for an individual or $11,600 for a couple in 2019. These assistance programs are commonly referred to as Medicare Savings programs (MSPs).
The Constitution provides each house of Congress sole authority to establish rules, judge membership requirements, and punish and expel its Members. Article I, Section 5, clause 1 provides that "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members." In addition, clause 2 provides that “Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member." In 1967, the House of Representatives created the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to establish standards for the official conduct of Members, officers, and employees of the House. The House Committee on Ethics was established as a permanent standing committee in 1968. The committee was given jurisdiction to investigate allegations of violations of the Code of Official conduct and to recommend to the House any legislative or administrative actions deemed necessary for establishing or enforcing standards of conduct. Since its creation, the committee's jurisdiction has been amended a number of times, most recently in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-194), which amended the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 and included a variety of ethics and pay reforms for the three branches of government. This report examines the history and evolution of the committee, including its jurisdiction and investigative procedure. It does not deal with changes to federal or state criminal law or with criminalutions of Members of Congress or with the specifics of disciplinary cases in the House, but rather provides a general overview of House ethics rules and procedures. It will be updated as warranted by major developments in these areas of law or in House ethics procedures.

On March 8, 2018, President Trump issued two proclamations imposing tariffs on U.S. imports of certain steel and aluminum products, respectively, using presidential powers granted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Section 232 authorizes the President to impose restrictions on certain imports based on an affirmative determination by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) that the targeted products are being imported into the United States "in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security." The President's actions have raised a number of economic and broader policy issues for Congress, including the potential impact of the tariffs on the economy, the impact on the international trading system, and the role of Congress in overseeing the executive branch's use of the statute. The Section 232 actions have been controversial, with some Members of Congress, some in support and others in support of the Administration, expressing concern that the tariffs could negatively impact U. S. workers, consumers, and industries. The Trump Administration's Section 232 action has led to the imposition of tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on certain imported automobiles and parts. The Administration has also initiated additional Section 232 investigations into imports of uranium ore and product imports in July 2018, and titanium sponges in March 2019. Commerce submitted the auto investigation report to the President on February 17, 2019, but the report has not been made public or shared with Congress; the uranium report is expected by mid-April 2019; and the titanium spONGes report is due in late November 2019. The President has 90 days to decide whether or not he concurs with the Commerce Department's findings and recommendations, and to determine the nature and duration of the action he views as necessary to adjust the imports so that they no longer threaten to impaired national security (generally, imposition of some trade-restrictive measure). The President may implement the recommendations suggested in the Commerce report, take other actions, or decide to take no action. After making a decision, the President has 15 days to implement the action and 30 days to submit a written statement to Congress explaining the action or inaction; he must also publish his findings in the Federal Register. While there is no specific definition of national security in the statute, it states that the investigation must consider certain factors, such as domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements; domestic capacity; the availability of human resources and supplies essential to the national defense; and potential unemployment, loss of skills or investment, or decline in government revenues resulting from displacement of any domestic products by excessive imports. The Commerce Department initiated a total of 31 Section 232 Investigations between 1962 and 2019, including three investigations that remain ongoing. In 16 of these cases, Commerce determined that the target imports did not threaten to impairment national security. In 11 cases, it determined that they threatened to impair national security and recommended that the President use his authority to adjust imports; the President took action eight times. One case was terminated at the petitioner's request before Commerce completed its investigation. Prior to the Trump Administration, 10 of the 31 investigations were self-initiated by the Administration. In addition to the two recent cases, in May 2018, Commerce announced the initiation of a third Section 232 investigation into the imports of automobiles, including SUVs, vans and light trucks, and automotive parts. Commerce held a public hearing to inform the investigation and requested comments from stakeholders on the impact of these imports on national security, identifying a broad set of factors related to national defense and the national economy for consideration. Commerce has 270 days from the initiation date to prepare a report advising the President whether or whether the targeted product is being imported "insuch quantities or in such circumstances" in such a manner as to "threaten to impair" national security; the report is to be made public in late February 2019. In the 115th and 116th Congress, a variety of proposals have been introduced to amend Section 232, in various ways, including by requiring an economic impact study, congressional consultation, or approval of any new tariffs, allowing for a resolution of disapproval of trade actions, and revisiting the delegation of its constitutional authority more broadly.
There are about 150 ombudsman offices located throughout the federal government. About a third of them are statutorily authorized. The others were created through executive action. Although there are differences among them in terms of their origin, staffing, funding, and organizational structure, they are all tasked with receiving and helping to resolve disputes in an impartial manner. The Office of the National Ombudsman, housed within the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), is fairly unique in that it is authorized to help resolve disputes received from the public across federal agencies. It was created in 1996 as part of P.L. 104-121, the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 (Title II, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of1996 [SBREFA]. SBREFA directs the SBA Administrator to designate an ombudsman to work with each federal agency with regulatory authority over small businesses to ensure that small businesses that receive or are subject to an audit, on-site inspection, compliance assistance effort, or other enforcement-related communication or contact by federal agency personnel are provided a means to comment on those regulatory compliance and enforcement activities; receive comments from small businesses regarding actions by federal agencies conducting small business regulatory compliance or enforcement activities, refer comments to the affected federal agency's inspector general in appropriate circumstances and maintain the confidentiality of the person or small business making these comments; and annually report to Congress and affected federal agencies an evaluation of the federal agencies' regulatory compliance activities, including a rating of the agency's responsiveness to small businesses. This report examines the origin and history of the Ombudsman; describes its organizational structure and funding; and discusses a recent legislative effort to enhance its authority. On March 19, 1996, the Senate passed, 100-0, S. 942, the small business regulation enforcement bill. The bill, which was based on the recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business, was incorporated into the contract with America advancement act of 1996. The House passed its version of the same bill, H.R. 4986, on March 23, 1996. In addition to the Office of National Ombudsmen, SBA also created the Office for Regulatory Fairness, which is also tasked with serving as an independent advocate for small businesses in the regulatory process (but primarily at the developmental stage). The SBA's Office of Advocacy, which has a similar mission but is focused primarily on regulatory development as opposed to regulatory enforcement and enforcement, was also established in 1996. It is authorized for seven employees, but currently has five employees: a Deputy National ombudsman (Mina Wales), an administrative officer, an external outreach manager, and two case management specialists. The Ombudsman's role is to provide small businesses, small government entities (those serving populations of less than 50,000), and small nonprofit organizations that believe they have experienced unfair or excessive regulatory enforcement or compliance actions (such as repetitive audits or investigations, excessive fines, and retaliation) with a means for comment about such actions. In FY2018, the Ombudsman assisted 354 small businesses and met with senior officials from 27 federal agencies, conducted 10 regional regulatory fairness roundtables across 5 of its regions, completed 118 outreach events, and initiated contact with 100 trade associations representing more than 2 million small business owners and SBA resource partners.
The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the President "in his discretion" "to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments." The act does not require the President to produce an evidentiary record or to follow specific procedures in establishing a national monument. Moreover, because proclamations under the act are issued directly by the President, rather than by an executive agency, they are not subject to the procedural and judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or the procedural or administrative record requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). As a result, the President's authority under the Antiquities act may offer a more expeditious means of preserving federal lands than other environmental statutes. The act also does not specify what effect the establishment of a national monuments has on the use of the objects and lands encompassed within the monument, other than by prohibiting the appropriation, excavation, injury, or destruction of "historic or prehistoric ruin[s]," "monument[s], or other "object[s] of antiquity." Instead, limitations on the uses of lands and resources within a monument follow from a variety of other sources. The Mineral Leasing Act prohibits new mineral leasing within national monuments, and a presidential proclamation may impose additional restrictions on mining and mineral claims, as well as oil and gas leases, timber harvesting, and hunting, fishing, and grazing. The President has clear authority to establish national monuments. However, it is less clear, however, what authority the President has to diminish a previously established monument or to abolish a monument altogether. On December 4, 2017, President Trump reduced the size of two national monuments—the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and the Bears Ears National Monument—for the first time since President Kennedy did so. These reductions have been challenged in court, and those cases are now pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs in these cases have raised multiple arguments to oppose President Trump's reductions. First, the plaintiffs argue that the President does not have the authority to abolish or diminish monuments once established. Second, they contend that, absent statutory authorization, these reductions exceed his constitutional authority and conflict with Congress's constitutional power to regulate public lands. Third, and finally, some of the plaintiffs have brought a claim under the APA against the Secretary of the Interior and other federal officials, arguing that because President Trump is acting unlawfully, these officials will be acting unlawfully in failing to abide by the original prodeclamations issued by President Clinton and President Obama. The United States contests the plaintiffs' standing to sue, contends that judicial review of Presidential proclAmendments is limited in scope, and argues that the plaintiff's arguments are meritless in any event. The parties advance competing interpretations of the text and implied authority of the act. In response to President Trump, Congress has enacted legislation in the 115th and 116th Congresses that would have overridden or repealed some of these reductions. The Property Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the power to dispose of federal law as it sees fit, and the Supreme Court has long held that "the power over the public land is entrusted to Congress without limitations."
Established by Congress as an amendment to the Clean Air Act, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates that U.S. transportation fuels contain a minimum volume of biofuel. The mandated minimum volume increases annually and must be met using both conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel (e.g., cellulosic ethanol). For a renewable fuel to be applied toward the mandate, it must be used for certain purposes (i.e., transportation fuel, jet fuel, or heating oil) and meet certain environmental and biomass feedstock criteria. A variety of factors, such as infrastructure, technology, and limited federal assistance, have led to challenges in meeting the total volume requirement established by Congress. These challenges have included a lack of cellulOSic biofuel production and delays by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in approving fuel pathways. Further, it is not clear how changes in gasoline consumption in response to fluctuating crude oil and gasoline prices impact the biofuel or conventional fuel industries. It is also uncertain how the program will fare once EPA implements the "reset" provision of the statute, which allows the agency to modify the volumes required for future years (starting in 2016) if certain conditions are met. The RFS was established in 2005 at a time when Congress foresaw the need to diversify the country's energy portfolio, strengthen the economy of rural communities that could contribute to biofuels production, bolster U.s. standing in an emerging segment of the energy technology market, and protect the environment, among other objectives. Over the past decade some components of the RFS have progressed steadily toward meeting statutory requirements and other components have not. For example, in 2015, the mandate capped the volume requirements for conventional bio fuel while increasing the volume of advanced bio fuel. However, in recent years, some advanced bio fuels have fallen short of the statutory targets. For instance, in 2019, the statute requires 8.5 billion gallons of cellulosIC biofuel, while EPA set the 2019 target volume at 418 million gallons. This shortfall is due to several factors, including lack of private investment, technology setbacks, and uneven support from the federal government. These factors, coupled with the fact that annual volumes in the statute were established when market conditions for raising investment capital for new biofuel technologies were more favorable, may suggest unrealistic targets for some advancedBiofuel technologies for the near future. The "blend wall"—the upper limit to the total amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline and still maintain automobile performance and comply with the CleanAir Act—has been viewed by many to be in direct conflict with the biofueling volumes mandated in the R FS. While the blend wall remains a concern, it may not be as significant an impediment to immediate fuel consumption as previously considered by some. EPA reports "the E10 blendwall is not the barrier that some stakeholders believe it to be." Had RFS mandates come to fruition in the form of mostly ethanol, or had fuel consumption decreased further, the blendwall potentially could have potentially led to more discussion about the volume mandates. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the implementation and feasibility of EPA's proposed and final rules as well as EPA's implementation of the program. In addition, some stakeholders have expressed concern about the transparency of the market wherein credits are traded to demonstrate compliance with the mandate. There is concern by some biofuel producers that the Trump Administration's issuance of multiple small refinery exemptions has adversely affected, or will adversely affect, biofuel demand.
In 1782, George Washington created the Badge of Military Merit to reward "any singularly meritorious action" displayed by a soldier, noncommissioned officer, or officer in the Continental Army. This award was intended to encourage gallantry and fidelity among soldiers, and would later become known as the Purple Heart. In 1932, Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur revived the badge as an Army award, renamed the "Purple Heart," and retroactively awarded to wounded World War I veterans. In 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt extended eligibility to U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard members serving in World War II. In 1952, President Truman retroactively awards Purple Hearts to Navy and Marine Corps veterans killed or wounded after April 5, 1917. In 1962, President Kennedy expanded eligibility to all U. S. servicemembers, and civilians serving with the Armed Forces, who were engaged in armed conflict against an opposing military or hostile foreign force. In 1984, President Reagan expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include military personnel and government civilians killed and wounded in terrorist attacks after March 28, 1973, or serving in peacekeeping operations outside of the United States. In 1996, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1996 (P.L. 104-106) expanded eligibility for Purple Heart awards to prisoners of war injured or wounded in captivity prior to 1962, a group previously not covered for Purple Hearts eligibility by President Kennedy's executive order. In 1997, President Clinton signed the NDAA for FY 1998, which limited future awards of the Purpleheart to military personnel. The Department of Defense (DOD) does not maintain a record of the number of Purple Heart recipients. However, some military historians estimated more than 1 million Purple Hearts have been awarded mostly to soldiers since 1932. During the 115th Congress (2017-2018), H.R. 7097 was introduced as the "Find our hearts Act." It would have amended Title 10, United States Code to require the establishment of a searchable database containing the names and citations of members of the Armed Services who have received the Purple Hearts. H.J.Res. 114-92 was introduced in the House of Representatives on January 13, 2017, as the Private Corrado Piccoli Purple Heart Preservation Act of 2017, and a related bill, S. 765, was passed by the Senate on August 3, 2017. Both bills were referred to committee but saw no further action. This legislation was reintroduced in the 116th Congress on January 15, 2019, as S. 122. The bill was read twice and referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. This report will be updated as events warrant.
A number of opportunities exist for individuals who are not regular congressional employees to provide assistance to congressional offices. The titles used to describe these positions are sometimes used interchangeably, but there can also be some key differences. An intern is an individual who provides assistance, paid or unpaid, to a congressional office on a temporary basis. The internship experience is typically considered to provide an educational benefit for that individual. In many cases, an intern's role does not substitute for or replace the duties of a regular congressional employee. A volunteer also provides assistance to the congressional office, and the experience is generally considered to be of educational value for the volunteer. In some cases, a volunteer's role can be similar to that of an unpaid intern, but the volunteer cannot receive financial compensation for his or her service. A fellow is an individuals who also performs services in a congressional Office on a Temporary basis, but typically through participation in an established, graduate-level or mid-career education program. Fellows often receive compensation from a sponsoring employer, professional association, or other organization while working in Congress during the course of the fellowships. A page is a high-school junior, at least 16 years old, who participates in a more structured program for a semester or summer. This report answers frequently asked questions about congressional internships, including: What is an intern? How is an internship different from a volunteer, fellow, or a page? What congressional rules specifically apply to interns? How long does an internship last? Can an intern receive school credit? How many interns can an office have? What is the selection process for interns? Are there differences between district/state and Washington, DC, internships? Do interns have to be U.S. citizens? What other information might an office provide to interns, such as emergency procedures and contact information for the appropriate police or medical services? Can interns work for a political campaign? Can they be related to Members or regular employees? Is there a minimum or maximum age for internships in the House or Senate? Can internships be sponsored by other organizations? Can a congressional intern be paid by another organization? This report will be updated as events warrant.

The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, more than a quarter of the land in the United States. Four federal agencies—the National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Land Management (BLM), all in the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) in Department of Agriculture—administer about 95% of those lands. No single law provides authority for these four agencies to acquire and/or dispose of lands. Rather, Congress provided various acquisition and disposal authorities through laws enacted over more than more than 100 years. The extent to which each of the agencies has authority to acquire or dispose of land, and the nature of the authorities, varies considerably. Most notably, the BLM has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals. By contrast, the NPS has no general authorities to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands. The FS and the FWS are not nearly as broad as the BLM's but not as restrictive as theNPS's. The agencies also have different authorities for acquiring and disposing of lands for different purposes. For example, the FS is authorized to acquire lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of a national forest, but it is limited to lands within and adjacent to these boundaries. The FWS has various authorities for acquisition but no general authority for disposal of its lands. In general, the acquisition authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquisition lands that could be viewed as benefitting from federal management. Among other circumstances, acquisition might be authorized to bring inholdings or lands adjacent to federal lands into federal ownership to improve or simplify management of federal lands, conserve species, protect natural and cultural resources, and increase opportunities for recreation. The disposal authorities generally are designed for the disposal of land that is no longer required for a federal purpose, might be inefficient to manage, or might be chiefly valuable for another purpose. For instance, disposal might allow lands to be used for agriculture, community development, mineral extraction, or educational purposes. Agencies also acquire and dispose of federal land in exchanges. Exchanges are not discussed separately in this report, as often the authorities that apply to acquisition also apply to land exchange. However, there are provisions of law particularly applicable to exchanges. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) provides broader exchange authority and is the main authority governing exchanges by the BLM and the FS. The General Exchange Act of 1922 authorizes the exchange of NFS land or timber that was reserved from the public domain if the Secretary determines it will be in the public interest. Congress often faces questions on the adequacy of existing authorities; the nature, extent, and location of their use; the extent of federal ownership overall; and the sources and levels of land acquisition funds, among other issues. With regard to the establishment of new authorities, for instance, some 115th Congress proposals would authorize states to exchange land grant parcels for federal lands. Proposals to modify authorities include measures to reauthorize and amend BLM authority to sell or exchange land under the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act. Other measures would authorize the BLM to convey small tracts to adjacent landowners and to govern the use of proceeds from these conveyances. This report will be updated as warranted.
Commemorative coins are coins that are "produced with the primary intention of creating a special souvenir to be sold (at a premium above face value) to observe or memorialize an anniversary, special occasion, or other event." Produced by the U.S. Mint pursuant to an act of Congress, these coins celebrate and honor American people, places, events, and institutions. Although they are considered legal tender, they are not minted for general circulation and are designed to be collected and to help designated groups raise money to support group activities. Commemorative coin legislation is often proposed by Members of Congress as part of their representational duties. The first commemorative coin was authorized in 1892 for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Since 1892, Congress has authorized 152 new commemorative coins. Between 1954 and 1981, Congress did not authorize any new coins. In 1982, Congress authorized a commemorative half-dollar for George Washington's 250th birthday, and in 1997, it authorized 47 new coins to commemorate the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta. In 1996, the Commemoration Coin Reform Act (CCRA) was enacted to (1) limit the maximum number of different coin programs minted per year and (2) clarify the law with respect to the recovery of Mint expenses before surcharges are disbursed and conditions of payment of surcharges to recipient groups. The CCRA restrictions began in 1998. Between 1998 and 2018, a total of 41 coins were authorized for minting in a given year. The average coin minted during this time period was authorized three years prior to being struck, with the longest time period between authorization and minting being the West Point Bicentennial coin, authorized in 1994 to be struck in 2002. In addition to completed coin programs, Congress also authorized coins to be minted in 2019 and future years. Currently, coins are authorized for 2019 and 2020. No coins are currently authorized for 2021 or beyond. Each Congress, several proposals are introduced to authorize new commemoratives. In the 115th Congress, the House and Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services have jurisdiction over legislation that would authorize coins for Minting between 2017 and 2022. This report examines the origins, development, and current practices for commemorative Coins, including the authorization process; the design of coins; and issues for congressional consideration, such as the disbursement of surcharge payments and the number of coins minted each year.
 corruption among high-profile public officials continues to be a concern in the United States. Likewise, recent examples abound of powerful executives in the private sector abusing positions of trust for personal gain. Faced with this reality, Congress has shown consistent interest in policing public- and private-sector corruption, enacting a number of criminal provisions aimed at holding corrupt officials accountable for their actions under federal law. However, one of federal prosecutors' most potent existing tools for combating such corruption—18 U.S.C. § 1346, which defines the crimes of mail and wire fraud as including so-called "honest services" fraud—has been a source of contention between the courts and Congress for years. While Congress has manifested its intent that the mail andWire fraud statutes should broadly cover the self-interested actions of federal, state, local, and private sector officials, the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have repeatedly limited the scope of 18 U. S.C.-1346 out of concern that a broad construction would render the statute unconstitutionally vague (and, with respect to state and local officials, potentially raise federalism concerns). This report provides an overview of the still-developing federal crime of honest services fraud and highlights certain legal issues that Congress may consider if it seeks to address the Scope of the Crime of Honest Services Fraud legislatively. Chapter 63 of Title 18 of the U.N. Code broadly criminalizes the use of the mails or wires in furtherance of "any scheme or artifice to defraud," or "for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises." A core category of conduct reached by these mail and Wire fraud statutes concerns misrepresentations or omissions that would deprive a victim of his or her money or Property. In such cases, "the victim's loss of money orproperty supplie[s] the defendant's gain, with one the mirror image of the other." A straightforward example is the filing of an insurance claim for a car accident that never happened in order to obtain a payout from the insurance company. Yet 18 U.,S.S., 1346 establishes that the term "scheme or artifices to def fraud" as used in Chapter 63 also "includes a scheme orArtifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest Services." This provision was enacted in the late 1980s, in response to the U,S. Supreme Court's holding in McNally v. United States that the law was "limited in scope" to only "the protection of property rights." Section 1346 abrogates McNally's holding, codifying the understanding of some of the lower federal court that the statutes extend to conduct that deprives a person or group of the right to have another act in accordance with some externally imposed duty or obligation, regardless of whether the victim so deprived has suffered or would suffer a pecuniary harm. Recognizing that this lower court understanding in fact evinced "considerable disarray" as to the kinds of schemes that would qualify as "h Honest Services" fraud, however, the Court subsequently read a limiting principle into Section 13 46 in Skilling v.United States to avoid invalidating the statute as unconst Constitutionally vague. After Skilling, mail andwire fraud prosecutions under an honest services theory may extend only to "offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participate[] in bribery or kickback schemes." The conversation between the Court and Congress regarding the scope and source of the requisite duty in Skilled has presented more questions that lower courts have been tasked with answering, including the sources of fiduciaries duties and the types of conduct that qualify as bribery and kickbacks. This report will be updated as events warrant.
The U.S. government's science offices and agencies support research and development and related activities across a wide variety of federal missions, including national competitiveness, space exploration, and fundamental discovery. The primary function of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is to provide the President and others within the Executive Office of the President with advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of issues that require the attention of the federal government. The OSTP director also manages the National Science andtechnology Council, which coordinates science and technology policy across the executive branch of the government, and cochairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and technology, a council of external advisors that provides advice to the President on matters related to science andtechnology policy. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in the nonmedical sciences and engineering. The NSF is a primary source of federal support for university research in these areas. The Department of Commerce's mission is to "create the conditions for economic growth and opportunity." The department promotes "job creation and economic growth by ensuring fair and reciprocal trade, providing the data necessary to support commerce and constitutional democracy, and fostering innovation by setting standards and conducting foundational research and Development." It has wide-ranging responsibilities including trade, economic development, technology, entrepreneurship and business development, monitoring the environment, forecasting weather, managing marine resources, and statistical research and analysis. The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) FY2020 budget requests $71.388 billion for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) for FY2020, which is $1.520 billion (-2.1%) less than the $72.908 billion appropriated for CJS for FY2019. When comparing the Administration's FY2020 request to the FY2019 funding, it should be considered that the Administration formulated its FY 2020 budget request before full-year appropriations for FY2018 were enacted. The Administration requests the following:  $12.214 billion for Commerce, which was $801 million (+7.0%) more than FY2019 enacted funding;    $30.529 billion for Department of Justice, which has a $405 million (-1.3%) decrease in FY2019 appropriations; $28.092 billion for science agencies, which had an FY2019 reduction of 5.0% from FY2018; and $552 million for the related agencies. This report will be updated as warranted by major legislative events.

This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the Navy's LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ship program. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget submission defers the planned procurement of the second LPD 17 Flight II ship, LPD 31, by one year, to FY2021, and requests $247.1 million in advance procurement (AP) funding for the ship. This report also discusses LHA-9, a different kind of amphibious ships that the Navy wants to procure in FY2024. Issues for Congress include whether to procure LPD31 (if it is procured in FY2020) with full funding or incremental funding; the amount of procurement or AP funding to provide for LPD -31 and LHA -9 in FY 2020; and more generally whether the Navy is placing too much, too little, or about the right amount of emphasis on Amphibious ships in its FY 2020 budget submission, particularly compared to other Navy shipbuilding programs. Congress's decisions on these issues could affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the LPD Flight II program and other Navy ships may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues For Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke. For a summary of the LHA/LHD-type amphibious assault ship program, see GAO-2019-10-818T , by Ronald A. R. Riddell. For more detailed information on other Navy amphibious programs, see the following CRS reports: CRS In Focus IF10240, Navy Amphibian Ships: Overview of Selected Programs, coordinated by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Issue Brief IB95033, Navy's FY2019 Budget Submission: Selected Programs for FY2019 and FY2020, by Rita Teitelbaum; and CRS Issues in Focus IB95034, U.S. Navy AmphIBious Warship Procurement and Funding: FY2020 Budget Submissions, by R.A. Lovell. For additional background on the L PD-17 flight II program, which is intended to replace the current fleet of LPDs 17-29, the Navy announced on April 10, 2018, that the replacement ships would be known as theLPD-18 Flight II ships. The first LPD flight-II ship is to be named LPD 30. Subsequent LPD flights are to be called LPD's 31-32, and so on. This program is expected to cost roughly $1.8 billion to procure. The LPD 18-30 is scheduled to be delivered in FY2019, and the Navy plans to procure a total of 13 LPD17 flight- II ships by FY2022. For further background on other LPD programs, including other Navy aircraft carriers and other surface ships, including the Air Force's F/A-18 Hornet and Marine Corps' Air National Guard aircraft and the Army's National Guard Airborne Division's Air Force Oak Ridge National Guard Oak Ridge Oak Ridge antitank helicopter carrier, this report will be updated as events warrant.
Beginning the summer 2013 through 2016, there were numerous reports in the media on sexual assault incidents in the U.S. armed services. In many cases, such reports were followed by questions on what actions were taken by the Department of Defense (DOD), the Obama Administration, and Congress to address the issue. This report lists a comprehensive chronology of official activities in response to incidents of military sexual assault, as well as legislative action on the issue in the 113th (2013-2014) and 114th (2015-2016) Congresses. The report is divided into three sections: the DOD's actions, congressional action, and legislation in the 114th Congress. Also included is a resources section with related articles, hearings, and reports. Information in this report was compiled from the official government websites of DOD, the Obama White House and Congress.gov for historical background and will not be updated. On June 13, 2012, DOD announced Army Major General Gary S. Patton as the new director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO). As part of DOD's efforts to confront the crime of sexual assault in the military, then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced improvements to prospective commander and senior enlisted training and a review of the initial military training environment in every service. On May 6, 2013, DOD released a 24-page memorandum from Secretary Chuck Hagel to all heads of the military services regarding DOD's 2013 Sexual Assault prevention and response strategy, and the release of the Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military 2012 (2 volumes). According to this report, in FY2012 (October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012), the number of sexual assaults reported by military personnel rose 6% to 3,374,374. An anonymous survey of military personnel who who who had experienced unwanted sexual contact could be as many as 26,000 but most never reported the incidents. That number is an increase over the 19,000 assaults estimated in 2011. These reports involved offenses ranging from abusive sexual contact to rape. In 2012, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2013 (P.L. 112-239, Section 576 (a). The NDAA for FY2013 was signed into law on October 1, 2013. It included a number of provisions to address sexual assault and related offenses in the Armed Forces. On December 26, 2013 – H.R. 3304, the NDIA for FY2014, was introduced in the House. It was passed by the House on December 26. On January 13, 2014, S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 was introduced, read twice, and referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services. The bill would have amended Title 10, United States Code, to require an Inspector General investigation of allegations of retaliatory personnel actions taken in Response to making protected communications regarding sexual assault. On February 3, 2015, the House passed the American Heroes Civilian Legal Assistance Act (AMLAA) of 2015, which would have provided for a permanent change of station or unit transfer by a victim of a sexual assault or other forms of sexual misconduct. It also would have required the establishment of a Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault. On November 25, 2015 – S. 1356, the National defense Authorization Act for FY2016 was introduced and passed in the Senate. Subtitle D "Military Justice, Including Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence prevention and Response" was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, which was signed by the President on December 23, 2015. It would have authorized $25,000,000 to be used for continued implementation and expansion of the Military Justice, including sexual assault programs. On April 12, 2016—H.R.-4909, the FY2017 NDAA was introduced. It passed the House in May 18 and was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders on May 26, 2016. It contained provisions to reform procedures for determinations to proceed to trial by court-martial for certain offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It did not achieve 60 votes and was defeated by a vote of 50-49 on June 16, 2016 (S. 2943). On May 19, 2016 — H-R. 5293, Department of defense appropriations bill, FY2017, was passed theHouse on June16, and was received in theSenate on June 17.
The Clean Water Act is the principal law governing pollution of the nation's surface waters. In its definition section, the act defines the term "navigable waters" to mean "waters of the United States, including its territorial seas." This single, jurisdiction-defining phrase applies to the entire law, including the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit program; permit requirements for disposal of dredged or fill material, known as the Section 404 program; water quality standards and measures to attain them; oil spill liability and prevention; and enforcement. The Corps and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have expounded on this phrase through agency guidance and regulations, which federal courts have struck down on various occasions as failing to satisfy statutory or constitutional requirements. Federal authority to regulate waters within the United states primarily derives from the Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the power to "regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states . . . ." Accordingly, federal laws and regulations regulating waters of the U.S. cannot cover matters that exceed that constitutional source of authority. In the mid-to-late 1990s, a series of court cases began to challenge the Corps' and EPA's interpretation of "waters" as defined in the act. The Supreme Court's 1995 decision in United States v. Lopez held that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to enact a law criminalizing possession of a firearm in a school zone because the law neither regulated a commercial activity nor contained a requirement that the firearm possession be connected to interstate commerce. The Court revisited its prior Commerce Clause cases and sorted Congress's commerce power into three categories: (1) regulation of channels of commerce, (2) Regulation of instrumentalities of commerce and (3) Regulations of economic activities which not only affect but "substantially affect" interstate Commerce. In 2001, the Supreme Court took up another challenge to the jurisdictional reach of the act in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (SWANCC), revisiting the issue for the first time since its 1995 decision. In SWANCC, the Court held that the Corps could not assert jurisdiction over isolated waters based purely on their use by migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Rule, and that allowing the Corps to do so raised "serious constitutional questions" about the limits of Congress's authority and would result in "significant impingement of States' traditional and primary power of land and water use." In response, the Corps and EPA issued a joint memorandum in 2001 in which they concluded that they could continue to exercise jurisdiction in isolated waters so long as the use, degradation, or destruction of those waters could affect other jurisdictional waters. The potential effect on or degradation on existing jurisdictionalwaters, the agencies reasoned, established the "significant nexus" mentioned in SWAN CC. In 2003, the two agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding how field staff should address jurisdictional issues in the Cleanwater Act and which contained a revised joint memorandum on the effect of SWANcc. The agencies later abandoned the rulemaking effort, however, leaving unanswered questions over federal jurisdiction in the courts. In May 2015, the federal government issued the Clean Water Rule, which was intended to take effect on August 28, 2015, but 31 states and 53 non-state plaintiffs, including industry associations, environmental groups, and others, filed suit challenging its legality. The plaintiffs argued, among other things, that the rule exceeded the agencies' statutory and constitutional authority and did not comply with the rule-making requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Environmental groups, seven states, and the District of Columbia intervened in defense of the rule. Before any court could address the merits of the claims, though, an impasse arose over what court was the proper forum for the litigation. Whereas some plaintiffs filed suit in federal district courts, others argued that a judicial-review provision in Section 509 of the Clean water Act gave the courts of appeals direct appellate-level review over challenges to the clean water rule. At the district court level, some courts dismissed their suits, concluding that the court of appeals had exclusive jurisdiction. But one district court ruled that it had jurisdiction to review the rule, and it granted a motion for preliminary injunction, temporarily barring the rule's implementation in 13 western states and adding another state, Iowa, to the scope of injunction. In parallel litigation at the appellate level, a Judicial Panel on Multidist
The federal government has played a role in subsidizing housing construction and providing homeownership and rental assistance for lower-income households since the 1930s. Today, Congress funds a number of programs to help meet the housing needs of poor and vulnerable populations. The programs are primarily administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), with some assistance provided to rural communities and some tax benefits administered through the Treasury. The modern housing assistance programs include both relatively flexible grants to state and local governments to serve homeless people, build affordable housing, provide assistance to first-time homebuyers, and promote community development; and more structured, direct assistance programs that provide low-cost apartments and rental vouchers to poor families, administered through local public, quasi-public, and private intermediaries. The federal government also makes tax credits available to states to distribute to developers of low-income housing and provides mortgage insurance to lenders that make certain types of mortgages to eligible homebuyer or developers of multifamily housing. One of the federal government's largest housing benefits, arguably, is the mortgage interest deduction, which is not targeted to lower- income households and is available to homeowners who pay mortgage interest and itemize their deductions. This report begins with an overview of the history and evolution of federal housing assistance policy. It then provides descriptions of today's major federal housing Assistance programs. The report concludes with a discussion of issues and trends in federal Housing Assistance Policy. The first major housing policy was formulated in response to trouble in the mortgage market resulting from the Great Depression. The Housing Act of 1934 (P.L. 73-479) created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and created the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund to fund the operation of the newly created mortgage insurance programs, and established national mortgage associations to buy and sell mortgages. The creation of FHA also institutionalized a new idea: 20-year mortgages on which a loan would be completely repaid at the end of its term. Over time, lenders began to make long-term mortgages without FHA insurance as long as borrowers made significant down payments. As in the case of the mortgage finance market in the early 1930s, the early federal government became involved in providing rental housing assistance as a part of a housing-related effort to create jobs and spur economic growth. In the early 1970s, President Richard M. Nixon criticized the existing programs as not equitably serving families in the same circumstances, providing poor quality housing, being too costly, and placing some families in homes they could not afford. He declared a moratorium on all new activity under the major housing subsidy programs—except for the Section 23 leased-housing program—that began in January 1973. In response to lawsuits and new legislation, Congress created the Section 8 rental assistance program in 1974. The Section 8 program combined features of the Section 236 program, which was popular with advocates of construction-based subsidies, and the Section23 leased- housing program, that used the existing housing stock. Through Section 8, the government provided private property owners monthly assistance payments for new or substantially rehabilitated rental units. In exchange for monthly rental payments, property owners agreed to rent to eligible low- income families (defined as families with incomes at or below 80% of local area median income), who would pay an income-based rent. By the mid-1980s, federal housing programs had gone through several iterations. Some programs had been scrapped as inefficient, subject to fraud and abuse, or too expensive. Shifting federal priorities—toward reducing taxes and increasing military spending—reduced funding available for social programs, including housing assistance. As a result of reduced federal support for housing, states and localities and private for-profit or nonprofit organizations began to take the initiative in developing innovative ways of providing housing in their communities. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, Congress acknowledged the value of local control and gave more decisionmaking authority over housing policy to local governments through the creation of block grants and tax credits. In 1986, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was created as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The LIHTC, intentionally or not, was one of the first major programs to give a good deal of control over federal funding for housing to states. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) reorganized the system of housing assistance to Native Americans by eliminating several separate programs of assistance and replacing them with a single block grant program.
The Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes the principal federal program to aid municipal wastewater treatment plant construction and related eligible activities. Congress established this program in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-500) (although prior versions of the act had authorized less ambitious grants assistance since 1956). Title II of the CWA authorized grants to states for wastewater treatment facility construction under a program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Federal funds were provided through annual appropriations under a state-by-state allocation formula contained in the act itself. States used their allotments to make grants to cities to build or upgrade wastewater treatment plants, supporting the overall objectives of the Act: restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. Through FY1984, Congress had appropriated nearly $41 billion under this program, representing the largest nonmilitary public works programs since the Interstate Highway System. The grants program was a target of budget cuts in the Reagan Administration, which sought to redirect budgetary priorities in part to sort out the appropriate roles of federal, state, and local governments in a number of domestic policy areas, including water pollution control. By the mid-1980s, there was considerable policy debate between Congress and the Administration over the future of the program's construction grants program and, in particular, the appropriate federal role in funding municipal water infrastructure projects. Congress's response to this debate was contained in 1987 amendments to the act. It authorized $18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plantconstruction, through a combination of the Title II grants program (hereinafter the clean water state revolving fund (CWSRF) program) and a new program, in CWA Title VI, for state-administered loans to build sewage treatment plants and, eventually, other water quality projects. Cities, in turn, would repay loans to the state, enabling a phaseout of federal involvement while the state built up a source of capital for future investments. Under the amendments, the CWSRF program was phased in beginning in FY1989 (in FY1989 and FY1990, appropriations were split equally between Title II and Title VI grants) and entirely replaced the previous Title II program in FY1991. The intention was that states would have flexibility to set priorities and administer funding, while federal aid would end after FY1994. Congress has continued to appropriate funds, and continued to assist states and localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs and complying with CWA requirements. In 1996, Congress established a parallel program under the Safe Drinking Water Act to help communities finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. Funding for drinking water occurred for several reasons. First, until the 1980s, the number of federal regulations was fairly small, and public water systems often did not need to make large investments in treatment technologies to meet those regulations. Second, good quality drinking water has traditionally been available to many communities at relatively low cost. By comparison, essentially all communities have had to construct or upgrade sewage treatment facilities to meet the requirements of theCWA. Over time, drinking water circumstances changed, as drinking water communities grew, and commercial, industrial, agricultural, residential, and land-uses became more concentrated, thus resulting in more contaminants reaching drinking water sources. Moreover, as many communities have found that their water may not not be good enough to meet federal water quality standards, many may not be able to meet state and local water infrastructure needs. The program authorized in the 1987 amendments expired in FY1994, but pressure to extend federal funding has continued, in part because, according to the most recent formal estimate by EPA and states (prepared in 2016), an additional $271 billion nationwide is needed over the next 20 years for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act, including projects in Alaska Native Villages, U.S.-Mexico border projects, and state and tribal water infrastructure grants. The America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L., 115-270), enacted on October 23, 2018, reauthorized appropriations for the DWSRF for FY2019, FY2020, and FY2021. This report will not be updated.
The nation's air, land, and marine transportation systems are designed for accessibility and efficiency, two characteristics that make them vulnerable to attack. While hardening the transportation sector against terrorist attack is difficult, measures can be taken to deter terrorists. The focus of debate is how best to implement and finance a system of deterrence, protection, and response that effectively reduces the possibility and consequences of terrorist attacks without unduly interfering with travel, commerce, and civil liberties. For all modes of transportation, one can identify four principal policy objectives that would support a systems of deterrence and protection: (1) ensuring the trustworthiness of the passengers and the cargo flowing through the system; (2) ensuringthe trustworthy of the transportation workers who operate and service the vehicles, assist the passengers, or handle the cargo; (3) the private companies that operate in the system, such as the carriers, shippers, agents, and brokers; and (4) establishing a perimeter of security around transportation facilities and vehicles in operation. Achieving all four of these objectives is difficult at best, and in some modes, is practically impossible. Where limited options exist for preventing an attack, policymakers are left with evaluating options for minimizing the consequences of an attack without imposing unduly burdensome requirements. Aviation Security. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress took swift action to create the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the U.S. Department of Transportation and gave it control over all airline passenger and baggage screening functions and deployment of armed air marshals on commercial passenger flights. In 2003, TSA was transferred to the newly formed Department of Homeland Security (DHS). To this day, the federal role in airport screening remains controversial. While airports are allowed to opt out of federal screening, alternative private screening under TSA contracts has been limited to 22 airports out of approximately 450 commercial passenger airports where passenger screening is required. Congress has sought to ensure that optional private screening remains available for those airports that want to pursue this option. The TSA Modernization Act, incorporated into the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254), includes language directing TSA to streamline the contracting process for private screening at airports, and directs TSA to look into the feasibility of modifying the program to allow individual airport terminals, instead of entire airports, to switch over to screening by private contractors. Security of Passenger Rail. Bombings of and shootings on passenger trains in Europe and Asia have illustrated the vulnerability of passenger rail systems to terrorist attacks. Passenger rail systems—primarily subway systems—in the United States carry about five times as many passengers each day as do airlines, over many thousands of miles of track, serving stations that are designed primarily for easy access. The increased security efforts around air travel have led to concerns that terrorists may turn their attention to "softer" targets such as transit or passenger rail. A key challenge Congress faces is balancing the desire for increased rail passenger security with the efficient functioning of transit systems, the potential costs and damages of a terrorist attack, and other federal priorities. Security in surface transportation is provided primarily by the transit and rail operators and local law enforcement agencies. TSA's main roles are oversight, coordination, intelligence sharing, training, and assistance. However, it provides some operational support through its Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams, which conduct operations with local police to create "unpredictable visual deterrents." Congressional efforts to promote the security of rail and transit include providing grants to service providers, requiring those providers considered to be high-risk targets (by DHS) to have security plans approved by DHS, and requiring DHS to conduct security background checks and immigration status checks on all transit and railroad frontline employees.
The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. Absent legislative action, capital gains tax rates would have reverted to pre-2003 rates of 20% and 10% (18% and 8% for assets held for five years or more), and dividends would be taxed at ordinary rates. The highest ordinary tax rate is currently 35% but, absent change, will rise to 39.6%. President Obama proposed in both his budget outlines (FY2010 and FY2011) to retain the 15% and 0% rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers, but to tax both dividends and capital gains at 20% for married couples and single taxpayers with income of $250,000 or more and $200,000 and $480,050 or more, respectively, in 2018. The tax rates were temporarily extended by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312). The final resolution at the beginning of 2013 (American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, P. l. 112-240) was to tax capital gains for higher-income individuals at the higher rate, but at incomes of $480 million and $453,350 for singles in 2018, considerably higher than those proposed by President Obama. Compared with most other tax provisions, the potential revenue gain scored for an increase in capital gains taxes is strongly affected by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the Department of the Treasury. Realizations responses in revenue projections by the revenue-estimating agencies were publicly discussed in the 1980s, in the midst of a contentious debate. This report explains how these responses affect revenues, discusses the debate that occurred in the late 1980's, reviews research since that time, and analyzes the implications for revenue effects. The analysis in this report suggests that the Obama Administration's projections and those of the JCT, absent a change in their realizations response, may likely understate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gain tax rates to expire. Although some of this differential could arise from different forecasts, assumptions about behavioral responses are the main reason for the reduction in projected revenues. To address these potential behavioral responses, some supporters of increasing taxes on capital gains have proposed applying mark-to-market rules to capital gains as accrued, which would eliminate the realization response for affected assets. Assets that are less easily valued could be subject to look-back treatment, which could increase the tax to achieve the same after-tax earnings that would have occurred if the tax were imposed on an accrual basis. Such an approach has a number of complexities, and to the extent that these changes aim to address the behavioral response, it is important to understand the limits this behavioral assumption imposes on options for increasing taxeson realized capital gains and the empirical basis for these estimated effects. In the 1990s, the Bush Administration proposed to reduce the capital gains rate that had been adopted in 1986 by increasing the top rate from 20% to 28%. The Administration chose an elasticity (at a 22% rate) of 0.98 for capital gains realizations, which is the percentage change in realizations when the tax rate falls by 10%, rather than the percentage increase when the rate rises by 10%. Because of the strict budget constraints applying at the time, the issue of revenue cost was a crucial one in 1990. Since then, the range of realizations elasticities, even if confined to time series estimates, is very broad for revenue estimating purposes. The range of estimated responses implied serious problems with the estimation methods, and the range was particularly broad for estimates based on individual data. The JCT took the position that the time series results were more reliable, and they estimated their own elasticities using this methodology. The Treasury never actually provided a specific methodology for their number, but rather reported it as a conservative choice given the realizations estimates.
Many observers consider sanctions to be a central element of U.S. policy to counter Russian malign behavior. This includes Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, election interference and cyberattacks, human rights abuses, illicit trade with North Korea, support to the government of Syria, and use of a chemical weapon. The United States also employs sanctions in an effort to deter further objectionable activities by Russia (e.g., expanding the war in Ukraine or launching new attacks in neighboring countries). Most Members of Congress support a robust use of sanctions amid concerns about Russia's international behavior and geostrategic intentions. The Trump Administration's pace in implementing sanctions, particularly primary and secondary sanctions under the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (CRIEEA; P.L. 115-44, Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act [CAATSA], Title II), has raised some questions in Congress about the Administration's commitment to holding Russia responsible for its malign activities. Administration officials contend they are implementing a robust set of Russia-related sanctions. As of the start of 2019, the Trump Administration has made 29 designations based on new sanctions authorities in CRIeeA, relating to cyberattacks (24 designations), human rights abuse (228 designations) and arms sales (231 designations). The Administration has not made designations under other new CRI EEA authorities related to pipeline development, corrupt privatization deals, or support to Syria (§232-234), nor has it made other designations related to weapons transfers abroad, gas export cutoffs, special oil projects, corruption, and sanctions evasion (§225-228) related to Ukraine-related and cyber-related EOs, as well as EOs related to Weapons Proliferation, North Korean, Syria, transnational crime, and international terrorism (§226-227). Some Members of the House and Senate have called on the President to make more designations. The Administration might not invoke various authorities for a number of reasons. First, the Administration might cite only a relevant executive order, for example, and not legislation with corresponding authority or requirements. Second, sanctions provisions have different evidentiary requirements, which could lead the Administration to choose one over another; it also might be easier to later remove a designation made under one authority than under another. Third, investigations can take time; if OFAC has not yet made a designation, it may still be investigating activity that is potentially subject to sanctions. Finally, if the Administration may seek to use a particular authority to deter objectionable activity, if that deterrence effort is successful, it might need to make only a few (or no) designationsbased on that authority. Congress has taken the lead in authorizing or requiring the President (or executive branch) to use sanctions to deter weapons proliferation, international terrorism, illicit narcotics trafficking, human Rights abuses, regional instability, cyber attacks, and corruption. Sanctions in response to Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and its subsequent fostering of separatism in eastern Ukraine have been imposed by the United States, the European Union (EU), and other countries. The EU has imposed sanctions on more individuals and entities directly related to the fighting in Ukraine—military officials, insurgents, and battalions—than has theUnited States. In response to the March 2018 attack on a British citizen and former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the United Kingdom, the EU approved a new legal framework in October 2018 that is to allow it to impose restrictive measures on individuals or entities involved in the use of chemical weapons, regardless of their nationality or location. Some European leaders and EU officials—including some members of the European Parliament—have called for an "EU Magnitsky Act" to impose sanctions on Russians complicit in human rights violations, money-laundering activities, and other "antidemocratic" activities. Since 2016, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have passed their own national versions of the "Magnitsky" Act or Global Magnitky Act. The Netherlands also has proposed that the EU should develop a new sanctions regime that could target individuals accused of human rights crimes worldwide, regardlessof their nationality. The Russian government has responded to sanctions imposed on Russia by imposing a variety of retaliatory measures, also known as countersanctions. In December 2018, Secretary of State Pompeo included Russia for the first time on the Special Watch List identifying "governments that have engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom
In FY2019 and FY2020, more than 90% of federal highway assistance is being distributed to the states by formula. Highway funding formulas have been in use to apportion federal highway authorizations among the states since the passage of the first federal-aid highway act more than a century ago. Although the procedure currently used to distribute federal highway funds is written into law and programs receiving funds in this manner are frequently referred to as "formula programs," the statutory language does not describe any formula in a straightforward way. In consequence, it can be difficult to understand how the apportionment of funds is determined, and whether that apportionments adequately reflects considerations that may be of concern to Members of Congress. This report describes the origins and development of highway formula funding, and then discusses how the use of various formula factors gave way to the current apportioning mechanism. A series of tables compares individual states' shares of the FY2018 apportioned highway authorization with their shares of some factors relevant to highway needs, such as population, land area, and postal road mileage. The report concludes with a discussion of recent legislation that has changed the formula used to apport highway funds. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141), enacted in 2012, eliminated or consolidated two-thirds of the federal highway programs. It also made major changes in the way funds were apportionED among states. Prior to MAP-21, Congress wrote authorizations for each individual program into law, and specified the formula factors that were to be used to determine each state's share of the authorization for that program. Beginning with MAP- 21, all the large formula programs shared a single authorization amount, and the states' apportiones of the total authorization were determined before their amounts were divided among the specific programs. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P-L. 114-94, enacted in 2015) is the current authorization of federal transportation programs, and it made only modest changes to the formula. It retained the basic formula factors used in the past, but it also added new factors designed to act as proxies for the needs a program was intended to address. For example, it created a new program, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), which was apporteded according to population in the state's air quality non-attainment areas relative to the national population living in those areas. The CMAQ program is the only federal highway program that does not rely on a single formula factor. The Federal-Aid Highway Program, which was created in the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 355) and was last reauthorized by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: a Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU; P.-L. 109-59) in 2005, apportions highway funds to each state on the basis of its share of total state population and land area in the most recent fiscal year for which data are available. In addition, each state is guaranteed an amount at least equal to 95 cents on the dollar of the taxes paid by its residents into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund, the source of federal funding for highways.
Historically located between empires, various Georgian kingdoms and principalities were incorporated into the Russian Empire beginning in the early 19th century. Georgia enjoyed a brief period of independence from 1918 until its forcible incorporation into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, or Soviet Union) in 1921-1922. Georgia gained independence in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Georgia is located in the South Caucasus, a region between the Black and Caspian Seas and separated from Russia by the Greater Caucasus mountain range. The South Caucasus also borders Iran and Turkey. Georgia's South Caucasus neighbors, Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been locked in territorial conflict for almost three decades over the predominantly Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh, formally part of Azerbaijan. Georgia has its own unresolved conflicts with two Russian-supported regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. After a short war with Georgia in 2008, Russia unilaterally recognized the independence of these breakaway regions and stationed military forces on their territory. Today, many observers consider Georgia to be one of the most democratic states among the USSR's successor states. The U.S.-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) Freedom House considers Georgia the freest post-Soviet state (not including the Baltic states). Georgia has a parliamentary system of governance, resulting from constitutional reforms that came into effect in 2013 and 2018. The most recent parliamentary elections in 2016 resulted in a sizeable win for Georgia's center-left ruling party, Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD), which initially led a ruling coalition after coming to power in 2012 and now governs alone. GD won 49% of the party list vote and nearly all majoritarian races, leading to control of more than 75% of parliamentary seats (116 of 150 deputies). Before losing this supermajority in February 2019, GD had enough votes to unilaterally enact changes to Georgia's constitution. This led many observers and opposition supporters to express concern that there were insufficient checks and balances against the ruling party. GD's main competitor in 2016 was the center-right United National Movement (UNM), the former ruling party previously led by ex-president Mikheil Saakashvili. After months of infighting, the UNM fragmented in 2017, and most of its deputies, including much of its senior leadership, formed a new opposition party called European Georgia-Movement for Liberty. The United States and Georgia have deepened their strategic partnership since Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia and 2014 invasion of Ukraine. The two countries signed a strategic partnership agreement in 2009 that provides the framework for much of the two countries' bilateral engagement. Since 2008, the United States has provided substantial security assistance to Georgia, including military and economic assistance, humanitarian assistance, and military training and capacity-building programs. In addition, Georgia has long been a leading recipient of foreign and military aid in Europe and Eurasia. In the 1990s and 2000s, Georgia became the largest per capita recipient of such aid in the region. Since the 2008 war, Congress has continued to support Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. In September 2016, during the 114th Congress, the House of Representatives passed a resolution (H.Res. 660) in a 410-6 vote that condemned Russia's military intervention and occupation of Georgia. In January 2019, a resolution was reintroduced in the House supporting Georgia's territorial integrity and condemning a decision by the Syrian government to recognize the breakaway breakaway Georgian regions of Abkhazi and Ossetian as independent states.
The rules of the House of Representatives generally grant Members an opportunity to review legislative measures by governing the length of time the measures must be made available before being considered on the floor. Different House rules establish availability requirements for reported bills and resolutions, unreported bills and joint resolutions, conference committee reports, and special rules (resolutions reported by the Rules Committee intended to regulate floor consideration of a measure named in the resolution). Under House rules, draft committee reports and unreported measures are considered available under these rules if they are "publicly available in electronic form at a location designated by the Committee on House Administration." Conference reports and accompanying joint explanatory statements are also considered available at such a location. In addition, the House frequently operates under special rules, or resolutions reported from the Rules committee, which can waive any or all of the above requirements. This report provides a brief overview of the availability requirements in House rules. In summary, a simple majority of House Members can call up, debate, and vote on a measure in a single calendar day, regardless of how long the text has been available, if the House agrees to a special rule waiving the one-day layover requirement for any special rule for the consideration of the measure. In order to achieve this result, however, the rules committee must have reported an additional special rule on the previous legislative day that waives the 72-hour availability requirement for the measure, and the House must agree to a separate special rule setting the terms of consideration of that measure and waiving any available requirements for that measure itself. The report concludes with a brief discussion of other ways in which the House can waive availability requirements, such as by agreeing to a concurrent resolution at the end of a session or by calling up a bill or conference report that has not been reported by a committee but has been made publicly available at a designated location in the Congressional Record (currently http://www.house.gov). This report will be updated as warranted by legislative activity.

The infrastructure needs of the federal land management agencies have been a subject of significant federal and public attention for many years. Congressional and administrative attention has focused on deferred maintenance and repairs, defined as "maintenance and repairs that were not performed when they should have been or were scheduled to be and which are put off or delayed for a future period." Deferred maintenance is often called the maintenance backlog. Each of the four major federal land Management agencies has maintenance responsibility for tens of thousands of diverse assets in dispersed locations. These agencies are the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS), all within the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Forest Service (FS) within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The four agencies typically identify deferred maintenance through periodic condition assessments of facilities. The agencies assert that continuing to defer the maintenance and repair of facilities accelerates the rate of these facilities' deterioration, increases their repair costs, and decreases their value. Debate has centered on varied issues, including the level of funds needed to reduce deferred maintenance, whether agencies are using existing funding efficiently, the priority of deferred maintenance relative to regular maintenance, and whether additional sources of funds should be directed to maintenance. Other issues include how to balance the maintenance of existing infrastructure with the acquisition of new assets, whether disposal of assets is desirable given limited funding, and how much to prioritize maintaining infrastructure relative to other government functions. This report focuses on these issues. It first provides agency deferred maintenance estimates for FY2018, the most recent fiscal year for which this information is available. It also discusses changes in deferred maintenance over the past decade (FY2009-FY2018) and then identifies some of the factors that likely contributed to these changes. For example, in current dollars, the total deferred maintenance estimate for the four agencies showed considerable variation over the 10-year period, with a peak in FY2012. It ended the decade relatively flat, with an increase of $0.36 billion (2%) overall, from $19.02 billion to $18.38 billion, or 2%. By contrast, in constant dollars, it decreased by $3.61 billion (16%) from FY2009 to FY2018. The NPS had the largest portion of the total, with $11.92 billion, followed by the FS at $5.20 billion, the FWS at $1.30 billion, and the BLM at $0,96 billion. The agency shares of the deferred maintenance totals differed throughout the decade, with the NPS having the largest share (62%) in each fiscal year and considerably more than any other agency. The FS had the second-largest share (27%), followed by FWS (7%) and then BLM (5%). The agencies' share of total annual deferred maintenance increased in both current and constant dollars over the decade. The extent to which these and other factors affected year-to-year changes in any one agency's maintenance backlog is unclear, in part because comprehensive information is not readily available in all cases or has not been examined. In particular, information based on the facilities condition index (FCI) seems to be incomplete or inconsistent in agency budget justifications. In some cases, budgetjustifications either do not provide FCI figures for assets or provide figures only for certain years. In other cases, it is not clear whether the FCI figure covers all agency assets or a subset of the assets. Together, the budget justification present a mix of FCI information using quantitative measurements; percentage measurements; and qualitative statements, such as that a certain number or percentage of structures are in "good" condition, but without corresponding FCI Figures.
A complicated body of rules, precedents, and practices governs the legislative process on the floor of the House of Representatives. The official manual of House rules is more than 1,000 pages long and is supplemented by 30 volumes of precedents. Yet there are two reasons why gaining a fundamental understanding of House legislative procedures is not as difficult as the sheer number and size of these documents might suggest. First, the ways in which the House applies its rules are largely predictable, at least in comparison with the Senate. Some rules are certainly more complex and more difficult to interpret than others, but the House tends to follow similar procedures under similar circumstances. Second, underlying most of the rules that Representatives may invoke and the procedures the House may follow is a fundamentally important premise—that a majority of Members should ultimately be able to work their will on the Senate floor. Although House rules generally recognize the importance of permitting any minority—partisan or bipartisan—to present its views and sometimes propose its alternatives, the rules do not enable that minority to filibuster or use other parliamentary devices to prevent the majority from prevailing without undue delay. This principle provides an underlying coherence to the various specific procedures discussed in this report. This report will be updated as needed to reflect changes in House rules or to reflect major developments in congressional practice. For additional information on House procedures, see CRS Report RL30787, Parliamentary Reference Sources: House of Representative, by Richard S. Beth and Megan S. Lynch, and CRS Reports 98-696, Resolving Legislative Differences in Congress: Conference Committees and Amendments Between the Houses, by Elizabeth Rybicki and Christopher M.

Congress is currently considering reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for either a shorter or longer term, while the program is still dealing with the financial impact of the 2017 and 2018 hurricane seasons. Total losses (insured and uninsured) for the 2017 hurricane season are estimated at a record $273 billion, with losses for Hurricane Harvey estimated at $128.8 billion, Hurricane Maria at $92.7 billion, and Hurricane Irma at $51.5 billion. The NFIP is designed to borrow money from the Treasury to cover claims for extreme events; however, the 2017 losses would have pushed the program over its authorized borrowing limit. Rather than increase the borrowing limit, in 2017, Congress canceled $16 billion of NFIP debt to allow the program to pay claims. Expanding the role of private insurers, including reinsurers, has been seen by many as an answer to the variability of the financial position of the NFIP. Advances in the analytics and data used to quantify flood risk along with increases in capital market capacities may allow private insurers to take on flood risks that they shunned in the past. However, increasing the private sector role in providing flood insurance coverage directly to consumers may have implications for the operations and fiscal solvency of theNFIP as currently structured. Increased access to private flood insurance could provide individual policyholders with a wider choice of coverage and possibly cheaper premiums, but may also lead to variable consumer protections. The extent to which private insurance companies participate in the U.S. flood insurance market represents an area of congressional concern. Both the 114th and 115th Congress addressed the issue with legislation passing the House, but no legislation was ultimately enacted. In the 116th Congress, no NFIP legislation has been considered in committee in the Senate. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on March 13, 2019, on NFIP reauthorizedization at which four draft bills were circulated. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs reported out a draft bill in April 2019 that would have reauthorized the program until May 31, 2019. This report will be updated to reflect legislative developments in the 116 th Congress, particularly focusing on private flood Insurance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified the need to increase flood coverage across the nation as a major priority for NFIPReauthorization, and this also forms a key element of their 2018-2022 strategic plan. FEMA has developed a "moonshot" with the goal of doubling flood coverage by 2023 through the increased sale of both NFIP and private policies. FEMA is also in the process of developing a redesigned risk rating system, known as Risk Rating 2.0, which is to be announced on April 1, 2020, and the new rates planned to go into effect for single-family properties across the country on October 1,2020. Many details are not yet known, but FEMA representatives have indicated the new rating structure will include replacement cost value and the distance between the property and a source of water. Risk Rating2.0 is to also include new sources of flooding, such as intense rainfall, that are not currently included in the rating structure.
The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (of 1988), hereinafter the Stafford Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5721 et seq.) authorizes the President to issue two types of declarations that could potentially provide federal assistance to states and localities in response to a terrorist attack: a "major disaster declaration" or an "emergency declaration." Major disaster declarations authorize a wide-range of federal aid to states, local governments, tribal nations, individuals and households, and certain nonprofit organizations to aid recovery from a catastrophic event. Emergency declarations authorize more limited assistance and are issued to protect property and public health and safety and to lessen or avert the threat of a major disaster. In most cases, the state governor or tribal leader must request an emergency declaration; however, under 501(b) of the act, the President has authority to issue an emergency Declaration without a gubernatorial or tribal request under specified conditions. The Stafford Act has been used to provide disaster assistance in the past to respond to terrorist attacks, but recent incidents such as the mass shootings that occurred in 2015 and 2016 in San Bernardino, CA, and Orlando, FL, respectively, and the 2016 vehicular attacks in Nice, France, and Ohio State University may have brought to light some potential shortcomings in the act's disaster assistance provisions. For example, the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting did not receive an emergency or major disaster declaration because the governor of Florida could not satisfactorily demonstrate that the response to the incident was beyond the capacity of the state and local governments. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is administered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), does not use the per capita threshold formula to make emergency declaration recommendations to the President. In general, FEMA will recommend that the President declare an emergency if public infrastructure damages exceed $1.42 per capita. FEMA does not apply any formulas to make recommendations for major disaster or emergency declarations. While there are differences between the two type of declarations, the ultimate decision to declare and grant federal assistance for emergencies and major disasters rests solely with the President, who has the discretion to do so. The three criteria for an incident to be eligible for an emergency disaster declaration include (1) definition, (2) unmet need, and (3) state action. An incident that does not meet the definition of a disaster, or does not have intersecting criteria, may have more difficulty receiving a disaster declaration. The scope of federal assistance provided under an emergency may be limited compared to that provided under a major or emergency declaration. FEMA assistance generally takes three forms: Public Assistance (PA), Individual Assistance (IA), and Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA). PA addresses the state or tribe's essential needs but concentrates on repairing damage to infrastructure (public roads, buildings, etc.). IA helps families and individuals. IA can be in the form of temporary housing assistance and grants to address post-disaster needs (such as replacing furniture, clothing and other items). It may also include crisis counseling and disaster unemployment benefit. HMA provides grant funding to the state for mitigation projects. IA and HMA do not necessarily need to mitigate risks from the type of disaster that was declared. Rather, HMA can be used to address mitigation projects identified before the declaration was issued. SBA disaster loans are usually the only type of assistance available to businesses after a terror attack. There are potentially four scenarios where the SBA Disaster Loan Program could be used for business recovery activities following a terror incident: Gubernatorial Request for Assistance, Business Physical Disaster Loans, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs). The SBA Administrator may issue an EIDL declaration when SBA receives a certification from a governor that at least five small businesses have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of the incident. Small agricultural cooperatives and most private nonprofit organizations located within the disaster area or contiguous counties and other political subdivisions are eligible for SBA disasters loans. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) assistance is generally available only for large-scale incidents, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Congress has authorized supplemental appropriations of funds for CDBG disaster assistance through the CDBG program for some major disasters, but only at the discretion of Congress.
This report provides background information and potential oversight issues for Congress on the Columbia-class program, a program to design and build a class of 12 new ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) to replace the Navy's current force of 14 aging Ohio-class SSBNs. The Navy has identified the Columbia class as its top priority program, and it wants to procure the first boat in FY2021. The program poses a number of funding and oversight questions for Congress. Decisions that Congress makes on the program could substantially affect U.S. military capabilities and funding requirements. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the Columbiaclass program and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke. Another CRS report—CRS report RL33640, U. S. Strategic Nuclear Forces: Background, Developments, and Issues, by Amy F. Woolf—discusses theColumbia class as an element of future U.s. strategic nuclear forces in the context of strategic nuclear arms control agreements. This report focuses on the Navy SSBN program as a shipbuilding program. The Department of Defense's (DOD's) report on the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), released on February 2, 2018, states the following: Ballistic missile submarines are the most survivable leg of the triad. When on patrol, SSBNS are, at present, virtually undetectable, and there are no known, near-term credible threats to the survivability of the SSBN force. Nevertheless, we will continue to hedge against the possibility that advances in anti-submarine warfare could make theSSBN force less survivable in the future. At any given moment, some of the Navys SSBN's are conducting nuclear deterrent patrols. The Columbia class will be the largest submarine ever built by the United States. It will replace the current Ohio class, which is scheduled to retire in 2027, and will be replaced by a new class of SSBN in 2031. The first Columbia class boat is expected to be ready for its first patrol in 2030. The current Ohio- class SSBN is scheduled for retirement in 2040. The United States and the United Kingdom (UK) are working together on a next-generation SSBN, called the Dreadnought-class, which will be armed with eight D-5 Trident II SLBMs. The UK plans to replace four Vanguard-class boats with three or four next- generation Dreadnoughs. Current UK plans call for each boat to carry eight SLBM launch tubes, with the other four tubes not being used for SLB Ms. The US is providing technical assistance to the UK for the program, as it has over the years for some other UK submarine programs. In addition to the modular Common Missile Compartment (CMC), the US is assisting the UK with the new nuclear reactor plant to be used by the new SSBN. A December 2011 press report states that "there has been strong [UK] collaboration with the US [on the US] program, particularly with regard to the CMC, the PWR, and other propulsion technology," and that the design concept selected for the dreadnought employs "a new propulsion plant based on a US design, but using next- Generation UK reactor technology (PWR-3) and modern secondary propulsion systems." The US/UK 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement is a Government to Government Atomic Energy Act agreement that allows the exchange of naval nuclear propulsion technology between the US and UK. Under this agreement, the UK Ministry of Defence is providing US Naval Nuclear Energy with US Naval Naval Nuclear propulsion technology to facilitate development of the propulsion plant for the UK's next generation SUCCESSOR ballistic missile submarine. The relationship between the UK and the US under the 1958 mutual defence agreement is an ongoing relationship, and the level of support provided varies depending on the nature of the support being provided.
House Rule XII, clause 4, prohibits the introduction or consideration of private bills for granting pensions, constructing certain bridges, correcting military or naval records, or settling claims eligible for action under the Tort Claims Act (U.S. Code, Title 28). Although no House rule defines what bills qualify as private, most private bills have official titles stating them to be "for the relief of" named individuals. Private bills are introduced and referred in the same way as other measures in the House, and are considered under a hybrid set of procedures known as "the House as in Committee of the Whole," meaning that there is no period of general debate, but debate and amendment may occur under the five-minute rule. Private measures are usually disposed of by voice vote. Although House Rule XII permits no cosponsors on private bills, cosponsors have occasionally appeared on bills that attract broad interest. In recent years, there has been a general decline in the number of private measures introduced in both the House and the Senate. This report will be updated as needed to reflect changes in the status of private legislation or to reflect legislative activity.

According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal workforce is composed of an estimated 2.1 million civilian workers, and several federal agencies collect, compile, and publish statistics about this workforce. Source sources may vary in their totals due to differences in how federal workforce statistics are compiled. In addition, federal civilian employee databases may exclude particular departments, agencies, or branches of government. This report focuses on differences in methodologies, including exclusions, and the frequency of data collection employed by OMB and OPM to determine the size and scope of the workforce. These differences will facilitate the selection of appropriate data for specific purposes. One example of a key methodological distinction is the difference between "full-time equivalents" (FTEs) and on-board personnel. Full-time equivalent employment is defined as the total number of regular straight-time hours (not including overtime or holiday hours) worked by employees divided by the number of compensable hours applicable to each fiscal year. Work years, or FTEs, are not employee "head counts." One work year, or one FTE, is equivalent to 2,080 hours of work. On-board employment, defined as full-time employees in pay status at the end of the quarter, provides a more complete picture of the size of the federal civilian workforce. OPM's annual report, Sizing Up the Executive Branch of the Federal Workforce, is an OPM report that provides access to frequently requested data related to the executive branch. The most recent report (FY2017) is available at https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/reports-publications/sizing-up-the-executive-branch-2016.pdf. The President's Budget, sometimes referred to as the President's budget, is a four-volume set of documents that includes detailed financial information on individual programs and appropriations accounts. Three volumes of the budget include information on direct civilian FTES. The Appendix typically includes an estimate of individual agency Ftes based on the President’s proposal along with an estimate and actual FTE count for the prior two years. The Historical Tables volume includes historical data on topics such as budget, receipts, outlays, and deficits. This volume also typically includes historical employment counts. The resources described in this report contain data often requested by Members or congressional staff. The sources covered differ in the methodology, including excluding certain departments and agencies, and frequency of collection. Users should be aware of these differences when using these sources.
The federal government is vested with the exclusive power to create rules governing alien entry and removal. However, the impact of alien migration—whether lawful or unlawful—is arguably felt most directly in the communities where aliens reside. State and local responses to unlawfully present aliens within their jurisdictions have varied considerably, particularly in determining the role that state or local police should play in enforcing federal immigration law. At one end of the spectrum, some states and localities actively assist federal immigration authorities in identifying and apprehending aliens for removal. At the other end, some jurisdictions have been less willing to assist the federal government with its immigration enforcement responsibilities. Often dubbed "sanctuary jurisdictions," these jurisdictions have adopted measures that limit law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including, for example, prohibiting police officers from assisting with federal efforts to identify and apprehend aliens within the state or locality's jurisdiction. The heart of the debate surrounding the permissible scope of sanctuary jurisdictions centers on the extent to which states, as sovereign entities, may decline to assist in federal immigration efforts, and the degree to which federal law preempts state action that undercuts federal objectives in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution's Supremacy Clause and constitutional principles of federalism. In particular, the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling in Arizona v. United States held that several provisions of one such enactment, Arizona's S.B. 1070, were preempted by federal immigration laws. Subsequent lower court decisions struck down many other state and local measures that imposed criminal or civil sanctions on immigration-related activity. Additionally, state andlocal jurisdictions have various reasons for choosing not to cooperate with federal enforcement efforts. Some of these reasons include concerns about potential civil liability or the availability of state resources to assist federal enforcement. During President Donald Trump's first month in office, he issued an executive order, "Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States," which, in part, seeks to encourage state and Local cooperation with immigration enforcement and disincentivize state andLocal adoption of sanctuary policies. The executive order requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that jurisdictions that "willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373" are not eligible to receive federal grants, subject to limited exception. The order also authorizes the DHS Secretary to designate a jurisdiction that she determines to be a "san sanctuary" and directs the Secretary to take "appropriate enforcement actions" against "any entity" that violates Section 1373 or that "has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law." Under Section 9(b), the President directs the DHS secretary to publish, weekly, a list of jurisdictions that ignore or fail to honor detainer requests for incarcerated aliens, "[t]o better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions." In May 2017, Attorney General Sessions issued a memorandum interpreting EO 13768, which, among other things, defined "san Sanctuary jurisdictions" as "jurisdictions that 'willfully refuses to comply" with 8 United StatesC. § 1373 (IIRIRA § 642). Two months later, in July 2017, the DOJ announced new conditions for grant eligibility under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) program, which provides federal funds to the states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories for various nonfederal criminal justice initiatives. The new conditions include (1) requiring grant recipients to certify compliance with Section 1373, which would notify DHS that the jurisdiction does not restrict its offices and personnel from sending or receiving citizenship or immigration status to or from federal authorities; (2) permitting DHS immigration enforcement personnel to access detention facilities housing aliens to meet with housed aliens and inquire into their eligibility to remain in the country; and (3) requiring recipients to give DHS 48 hours' advance notice before releasing from custody an alien who DHS believes is removable for a violation of federal law. The DOJ's new Byrne JAG conditions were challenged in federal court, and a district court in the Southern District of New York enjoined the DOJ from imposing the conditions on the states and the City of Chicago and Philadelphia. In June 2017, a federal court in Los Angeles, California, granted a permanent injunction against the DOJ's implementation of the new conditions, holding that the conditions violate the separation of powers and the anti-commandeering doctrine. The federal government has
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was created by the National Flood insurance Act of 1968 (NFIA). The NFIP is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), through its subcomponent the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA). As of October 2018, the NFIP had more than 5.1 million flood insurance policies providing more than $1.3 trillion in coverage. The program collects about $3.6 billion in annual premium revenue. Nationally, as of January 2019, about 22,355 communities in 56 states and jurisdictions participated in the program. According to FEMA, the program saves the nation an estimated $1 billion annually in flood losses avoided because of the program's building and floodplain management regulations. The last long-term reauthorization of theNFIP was by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (hereinafter BW-12), from July 6, 2012, to September 30, 2017. Congress amended elements ofBW-12 in the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (HFIAA, P.L. 114-113), but did not extend the NFIA's authorization further. In the original NFIP statute, Congress stipulated that "a program of flood insurance can promote the public interest by providing appropriate protection against the perils of flood losses and encouraging sound land use by minimizing exposure of property to flood losses." Congress had found that postdisaster flood losses, and the subsequent federal disaster relief assistance to help communities recover from those flood Losses, had "placed an increasing burden on the Nation's resources" and that as a matter of national policy "a reasonable method of sharing the risk of flood loss is through a program of Flood Insurance which can complement and encourage preventive and protective measures." Thus, NFIP essentially has two interrelated policy purposes that can be summarized as 1. to provide access to primary flood insurance, thereby allowing for the transfer of some of the financial risk of property owners to the federal government, and 2. to mitigate and reduce the nation's comprehensive flood risk through the development and implementation of floodland management standards. A core design feature of the NFICP is that communities are not required to participate in the Program by any law or other regulation. Rather, communities in the United States voluntarily participate as a means of securing access to the primary NFIP flood insurance. The availability of the primary flood policy through the program is tied to the adoption and enforcement of floodplain standards by participating communities. FEMA is only allowed to provide flood insurance to "those States or areas (or subdivisions thereof)" where "adequate land use and control measures" have been adopted that "are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use developed" by NFIP. Thus, communities that participate in NFIP, and therefore whose residents may access NFIP's primary flood coverage, also adopt through local or state laws minimum flood plain management standards that are described in FEMA regulations. These standards are intended to (1) constrict the development of land which is exposed to flood damage where appropriate, (2) guide proposed construction away from locations which are threatened by flood hazards, (3) assist in reducing damage caused by floods, and (4) otherwise improve the long-range land management of flood-prone areas. FEMA also operates a program, called the Community Rating System, to incentivize NFIP communities to adopt more rigorous standards. As of June 2017, FEMA estimated that only 5% of eligible NFIP community participate in this program, but more than 69% of all flood policies are written in CRS-participating communities. For April 2014 premium rates, the National Research Council estimated that the CRS program provided an average 11.4% discount on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), which are flood maps developed by FEMA that depict the community's flood risk. The CRS discount is cross-subsidized, such that the discount for one community ends up being offset by increased premium rates in all communities across the NFip. Thus in some circumstances, the discount provided to CRS communities may be less than the expense of the overall CRS Program. Congress has expressed concern related to the perceived affordability of flood premiums. In BW- 12, Congress required FEMA to commission a study with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) regarding participation in the NF IP and the affordability of premiums. The Affordable Study was not finished by its original deadline (270
The changing dynamics and composition of international trade and finance can affect the overall health of the U.S. economy, the success of U. S. businesses and workers, and the U.-S. standard of living. They also have implications for U.s. geopolitical interests. Conversely, geopolitical tensions, risks, and opportunities can have major impacts on international trade. These issues are complex and at times controversial, and developments in the global economy often make policymaking more challenging. Congress is in a unique position to address these and other issues given its constitutional authority for legislating and overseeing international commerce. The major focus of the 115th Congress was overseeing the Trump Administration's evolving trade policy. The Administration's approach to international trade arguably represents a significant shift from the approaches of prior administrations, in that it questions the benefits of the United States' leadership in the rules-based global trading system and expresses concern over the potential limits that this system may place on U. s. sovereignty. As such, the Administration's withdrawal from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), imposition of unilateral trade restrictions on various U.N. imports, renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), modification of certain provisions in the U-S.-South Korea (KORUS) free trade agreement (FTA) and launch of an extensive review of the World Trade Organization (WTO) were among the most notable developments in U.C. trade policy in the past two years. Other issues before the 116th Congress included approving legislation to (1) strengthen the process used to review the national security implications of foreign direct investment transactions in the United states; (2) modernize U.L. development finance tools; and (3) provide temporary tariff suspensions and reductions—through Miscellaneous Tariff Bills—on certain products not available domestically. Continued focus on economic sanctions against Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and other countries was also of interest to many in Congress. The Trump Administration has displayed a more critical view than past administrations of U.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and other trade agreements and has made greater use of various U.-U.S.-specific trade laws and authorities with the potential to restrict imports. As part of this shift in focus, the administration has placed a greater emphasis on "fair" and "reciprocal" trade. China has also been a center of attention as the Administration has sought to address longstanding concerns over its policies on intellectual property (IP), forced technology transfer, and innovation. Citing these concerns and others, the President has unilaterally imposed trade restrictions and imposed new tariffs on a number of imports. While some supported the President's actions, others raised concerns about the potential negative economic implications of these actions and the risks they pose to the Rules-based international trading system. Several Members introduced bills to amend some of the Presidents trade authoritiesfor example, to require congressional consultation or approval before imposing new trade barriers. Congress may also consider measures to reassert its authority over tariffs or narrow the scope of how the president can use delegated authorities to impose such restrictions. In addition to specific trade practices of concern, Congress may scrutinize the economic and geopolitical implications of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which finances and develops infrastructure projects across several countries and regions. Congress also may examine the economic impact of Chinaas well as its policies in high technology sectors, which could potentially disrupt global markets. How these evolving issues play out, combined with the global economic landscape, raise potentially significant legislative and policy questions for Congress.
Some commentators and policymakers argue that multinational corporations (MNCs) in the digital economy are "undertaxed" or are not paying a "fair share" of taxes in their jurisdictions. Two issues that often underlie these sentiments are (1) the ability of digital economy MNCs to provide services without establishing a physical presence (or "permanent establishment") in the country in which their customers reside and (2) the able of digital-economy firms to shift their profits away from countries where they conduct real economy activity (e.g., sales, development, production) toward low-tax jurisdictions where they are conducting little to no real economic activity. In response to these concerns, some countries and intergovernmental organizations have proposed or implemented policies to tax digital economy firms on specific grounds. Some of these proposals include a "digital presence" tax (DST), which would allow a country to tax a portion of a firm's profits earned in a country that is not the country where the firm's customers reside. DSTs have been characterized as extensions of different types of tax regimes ranging from a tax on corporate profits to something more like a selective or excise tax on specific types of activities that is standalone from income tax regimes. Based on policy analysis, though, D STs resemble a selective tax on revenue (akin to an excise tax) and not as a tax in lieu of a corporate profits tax. The economic impact of a DST could vary depending on the structure and characteristics of the individual markets in which it is imposed. Under one scenario, the economic burden is borne by the consumers of the services that are subject to the DST in the form of higher prices. Under an alternative scenario, however, the burden is passed on to the firms that provide the services in question (i.e., the companies that sell the services) or the final consumers of those services. The exact magnitude of these changes will depend on the responsiveness of supply and demand in those markets to changes in price. In a market with relatively elastic demand, the magnitude of the change in price will be greater than thechange in quantity demanded. In this case, the tax will be passed on in higher prices to consumers. In contrast, in a market where consumers are more responsive, or inelastic, to price changes, the cost of the tax is likely to be lower than in a competitive market. In addition to effects on price and quantity prevailing within a market, Dsts can also have "welfare effects." Under this method of analysis, economists consider changes to consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss. Consumer surplus is the total benefit of value of a good or service that consumers receive beyond what they actually pay in the market. It is depicted on a supply-demand graph as the area below the demand curve and above the price. Producer surplus isthe benefit to producers from selling a good and service at a price higher than their marginal cost of producing one additional unit. It has been argued that the European Commission's and the United Kingdom's DST proposals are "interim measures" that are intended to address the perceived unfairness of the current international tax system in that they do not address the "value" created by users and behavioral data that forms a key part of the business models of firms in thedigital economy. The user-based value creation argument says that some digital platforms benefit from "network effects," in which the contributions of one user benefit other users and draw more users to utilize the platform. Critics of this "value-creation" argument could make various rebuttals. For example, the value created is achieved by the innovations and assets of the companies themselves, not by the actions of a single user. The companies—not the customers— bear the risk associated with investments in innovative technologies and platforms.
In the past two decades, increasing global trade liberalization, among other factors, has led to a rise in U.S. agricultural imports. The USDA reports that the volume of agricultural imports reached nearly $121 billion in the 2017 calendar year, which was twice the level of such imports in 2000. Consequently, the increasing volume of imports has heightened public concern about the potential for introducing pests and diseases into the United States. Most imported agricultural products, such as live animal and plants, are inspected by U. S. government officials and have accompanying documentation—animal and plant health import permits—certifying adherence to U.s. requirements. More than ever, the government depends on the proper use of these import permits to facilitate the flow of agricultural trade. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) within the U.N. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates the import, transit, and release of regulated animals, animal products, veterinary biologics, plants, plant products, pests, organisms, soil, and genetically engineered organisms. APHIS-issued import health permits verify that the health status and the production practices of an imported product meet U. s. import standards. The import permits are required to facilitate international and domestic agricultural trade and to prevent the introduction of pests, diseases, and invasive species that could harm the health of domestic crops, livestock, and the environment. The Health Import Permit System (HIPPS) is a tool that USDA uses to facilitate trade in animal, plant, and pest products. The HIPPS permits are issued by USDA's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to ensure that imported animal and plant products have the required animal or plant health permits, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) certificates, and other required documentation. The permits are also required for imported products that have been determined to pose a threat to human and animal health, plant health, or animal and Plant Products. The health import permit process is a joint effort between USDA and other federal agencies, including CBP and the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and of Agriculture, and state-level agriculture departments. Congress has long been involved in efforts to prevent pests and disease threats from entering the country. This oversight has manifested in various congressional actions, including continuing to provide USDA with appropriations to monitor pests, introducing legislation to address invasive species (e.g., Areawide Integrated Pest Management, H.R. 5411, 115th Congress), and directing CBP to enforce USDA regulations to deter agricultural smuggling. Congress also has taken steps to address potential harmful imports ("select agents") that could impact public health or animal/plant health through the Bioterrorism Act by directing HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and USDA to enforce the Select Agents and Toxins List under the Federal Select Agent Program. In addition, Congress has directed other federal and state agencies to participate in inspecting agricultural products regulated by USDA, including FDA, CBP, and states.
In the 116th Congress, the House has passed four cybersecurity-related bills and the Senate has given varying levels of consideration to four others, passing one. The Senate has also held a number of cybersecurity hearings. This report provides a list of cybersecurity bills and hearings in the House and Senate in the 115th Congress. It will be updated as legislative activity warrants. In the Senate, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Oversight Act of 2017 (S. 754) was signed into law (P.L. 115-246) on November 21, 2017. In addition, on November 2, 2017, Congress passed the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of2017 (P,L. 114-76), which authorizes a National Computer Forensics Institute within the U.S. Secret Service to disseminate information related to the investigation and prevention of cyber and electronic crime and related threats. On September 28, 2018, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act of 2018 was signed by President Trump into law. In total, 31 bills received committee consideration or passed one or both chambers in the 114th Congress; five bills became public laws: H.R. 1560 (the National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act), S. 7 54 (the Information Technology for the National Security Act ofhensive Implementation Act, or CISA), the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018), the John S. McCain National Defense authorization act for Fiscal year 2018, and H.J.Res. 55 (the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2018). In the House, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology passed two cybersecurity bills (H.R., 1731 and S.Rept. 113-291). The House also passed the Cybercrime and Infrastructure Protection Reauthorization Act of 2019 (the Cybersecurity Act of2019), which included the Cyber Act of 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, and the Cyber Security Presidential Directive (the Homeland Security Act, 2021). The Senate passed one cybersecurity bill, the Federal Information Technology For Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Act (the Federal Trade Commission Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2025). In addition to these bills, the Senate and House also held cybersecurity hearings on a variety of cybersecurity issues. This list of hearings is compiled from CRS products. CRS identified these hearings as being primarily about cybersecurity or related issues. However, no single, objective selection criterion was available for CRS to use in identifying which hearings to include. The list should therefore not be considered definitive. The tables in this report contain active links to the committee's website for that particular hearing.
The United States has long been a major contributor of foreign assistance to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Between 1946 and 2017, the United States provided the region with more than $88 billion ($181 billion in constant 2017 dollars) of assistance. U.S. assistance to the region spiked in the early 1960s following the introduction of President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, an anti-poverty initiative that sought to counter Soviet and Cuban influence in the aftermath of Fidel Castro's 1959 seizure of power in Cuba. After a period of decline in the 1970s and 1980s, assistance increased again following the 1979 assumption of power by the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua. The United States also provided considerable support to Central American governments battling leftist insurgencies to prevent potential Soviet allies from establishing political or military footholds in the region in the 1980s and 1990s. Aid levels declined in the mid-1990s, however, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Central American conflicts. Since FY2014, aid levels have rebounded, largely due to a renewed focus on Central America in response to recent migration trends, but appropriations remain below the FY2008-FY2013 average. The Trump Administration's FY2019 foreign assistance budget request would have reduced funding for the region by $581 million (34%) compared with the FY2018 estimate. The Administration's request included $435.5 million to continue its strategy for engagement in Central America, which would have been a $191 million (30%) cut compared with FY2018. The request also included $252.8 million for the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) and $45.7 million for El Salvador (-21%), $69.4 million for Guatemala (-42%), $65.8million for Honduras (-18%), and $1.8 billion combined for Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama (-82%). It did not include any democracy assistance to support civil society groups in Nicaragua (such assistance totaled $10 million in FY2018). Colombia would have remained the single largest recipient of Latin American and Caribbean assistance in FY2019 under the request, but aid would have fallen to $265.4million—a $125.8-million (32%) reduction compared with its FY2018 level. The FY2019 request included funds to support implementation of the Colombian government's peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC); it sought to foster reconciliation within Colombian society, expand state presence to regions historically under FARC control, and support rural economic development in marginalized communities. It also sought to support Colombia's drug eradication and interdiction efforts. Haiti, which has received high levels of aid for many years as a result of its significant development challenges, would have continued to be the second-largest recipient of aid in FY 2019 under the Administration's budget request. Mexico would have received $78.9 million of assistance under the FY2019 budget request, which was a $73.8-$78 million (48%) cut from FY2018 levels. In addition to the proposed reductions to State Department and USAID-managed assistance, the Trump Administration proposed eliminating the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) and consolidating its programs into USAID. The IAF provides grants and other targeted assistance directly to the organized poor to foster economic and social development and to encourage civic engagement in their communities in 20 countries, including eight countries in which USAID no longer has a presence. The proposed cuts to the IAF were slightly greater than the 28% reduction the Administration proposed for the global foreign aid budget in FY2017, but Congress did not adopt many of the proposed cuts for FY2019. On February 15, 2019, nearly four and a half months into the fiscal year, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6). Division F of the act—the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations act, 2019—includes funding for foreign assistance programs in the Caribbean and Latin America. The measure was preceded by three short-term continuing resolutions that funded foreign aid programs at the FY2017 level, and a 35-day lapse in appropriations from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. Although the House and Senate Appropriations Committees had approved their FY2019 appropriations measures (H.R. 6385 and S. 3108, respectively) in June 2018, neither bill received floor consideration prior to the end-of-the 115th Congress. P
Article I, Section 9, of the U.S. Constitution provides, "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." The Constitution does not, however, prescribe any specific structure or process for making appropriations. The committee structure established by Congress during the 20th century assigns a prominent role to the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate for both the development of appropriations legislation and oversight over budget execution. The Appropriations Committees, in turn, have created a system of subcommittees designed to facilitate their ability to carry out these tasks. The number and jurisdictions of appropriations subCommittees have evolved to meet changing needs and circumstances. For example, reorganization was undertaken at the beginning of the 108th Congress in response to the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security. After the legislation establishing the new department was enacted, the House Appropriations Committee established a new subcommittee. Shortly thereafter, a similar change was made in the Senate Appropriations Committee. In both chambers, jurisdiction over the Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development was transferred to the Transportation Subcommittee. Jurisdiction over the State Department was transferred from the State, Justice, and Commerce subcommittee to the State and Foreign Operations subcommittee, and jurisdiction over defense health programs and military facilities sustainment and housing accounts was moved from the House Military Quality of Life Subcommittee to the Defense subcommittee. The House also created a new Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and the Senate created a separate subcommittee on the District of Columbia. In the House, jurisdiction for the Department of Veterans Affairs was moved to the newly created Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs and Military Construction, while jurisdiction for Defense health programs was transferred in the House to the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. The Senate subsequently adopted a reorganization plan as well, eliminating the subcommittee on veterans affairs, housing and urban development, and independent agencies and making the following major changes: jurisdiction over veterans affairs and the federal judiciary was transferred into the newly established Subcommittee on Transportation, the Treasury and General Government, and a separate Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development; jurisdiction over National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies was moved into the new subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Commerce, State, and State and the Judiciary; jurisdiction for other agencies formerly exercised by the former Subcommittee on the Department of Veterans' Affairs was transferred away from the eliminated VA-HUD subcommittee to a newly created subcommittee on Defense; and jurisdiction for energy-related accounts was transferred out of the Interior Subcommittee and into the Energy and water development subcommittee. This report will be updated as events warrant.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to enhance small business access to capital; venture capital programs, including the now inactive New Markets Venture Capital (NMVC) program, to foster small business expansion; programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loans for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and access to entrepreneurial education to assist with business formation and expansion. The NMVC program is designed to promote economic development and the creation of wealth and job opportunities in low-income geographic areas and among individuals living in such areas by encouraging developmental venture capital investments in smaller enterprises primarily located in those areas. Modeled on the SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program, NMVC companies provide funding and operational assistance to small businesses. To do so, they use private capital the NMVC company has raised (called regulatory capital) and up to 150% of that amount (called leverage) from the sale of SBA-guaranteed 10-year debentures, or loan obligations, to third parties, subject to the availability of funds. At least 80% of the investments must be in small businesses located in a low- or moderate-income area, as defined in the statute. Specialized Small Business investment companies (SSBICs) established under the SBIC program are also eligible for NMVC operational assistance grants, which are awarded on a dollar-to-dollar matching basis. In FY2018, the active unpaid principal balance (which is comprised of the guaranteed portion and the unguarantee portion of the NM VC companies' unpaid principal balances) for the program peaked at $698 million in FY2008, and then fell each year thereafter until reaching $0 in FY2018. Since the program's inception in FY2001, the program has not received any additional funding. The program's unobligated balances for FY2001 through FY2006 were rescinded by P.L. 108-7, the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, which became law on February 20, 2003. No bills have been introduced since the 112th Congress concerning the program since then. However, more than 30 bills were introduced in previous Congresses to either expand or amend the program. Many of these bills included provisions to provide additional funding to the program, such as the Job Creation and Urban Revitalization Act of 2011 (H.R. 2872), which would have provided $75 million of debenture guarantees and $15 million for operational assistance for FY2012 through FY2013. No further action was taken on the bill.
Through its investigative powers, Congress gathers information it considers necessary to oversee the implementation of existing laws or to evaluate whether new laws are necessary. This "power of inquiry" is essential to the legislative function and derives directly, though implicitly, from the Constitution's vesting of legislative power in the Congress. The information that Congress seeks, whether to inform itself for lawmaking purposes or to conduct oversight, often lies in the executive branch's possession. And while executive branch officials comply with most congressional requests for information, "experience has taught that mere requests" can sometimes be "unavailing," and that "information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete . . . ." The Supreme Court has therefore determined that "some means of compulsion [is] essential" for Congress "to obtain what is needed." When Congress finds an inquiry blocked by the withholding of information, or where the traditional process of negotiation and accommodation is considered inappropriate or unavailing, a subpoena—either for testimony or documents—may be used to compel compliance with congressional demands. An individual—whether a member of the public or an executive branch official—has a legal obligation to comply with a duly issued and valid congressional subpoena, unless a valid and overriding privilege or other legal justification permits non-compliance. The subpoena, however, is only as effective as the means by which it is potentially enforced. Without a process by which Congress can coerce compliance or deter noncompliance, the subpoena would be reduced to a formalized request rather than a constitutionally based demand for information. Congress currently employs an ad hoc combination of methods to combat noncompliance with subpoenas. The two predominant methods rely on the authority and participation of another branch of government. First, the criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the Executive Branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to respond to a committee subpoena. Once the contempt citation is received, any later prosecution lies within the control of the Executive branch. Second, Congress may try to enforce a subpoena by seeking a civil judgment declaring that the recipient is legally obligated to comply. This process of civil enforcement relies on the help of the courts to enforce congressional demands, but has only rarely resorted to either criminal contempt or civil enforcement. In most circumstances involving the Executive, committees can obtain the information they seek through voluntary requests or after issuing (but not yet seeking enforcement of) a subpoena. Even where the executive is initially reluctant to provide information, Congress can use the application of various forms of legislative leverage, along with an informal political process ofnegotiation and accommodation, to obtain what it needs. But legislative leverage and the subpoena enforcement mechanisms do not always ensure congressional access to requested information, particularly from the executive branches. Recent controversies could be interpreted to suggest that the existing mechanisms are at times inadequate—at least in the relatively rare instance that enforcement is necessary to response to a current or former executive branch officer who has refused to comply in an ongoing investigation. Four times since 2008, the House of Representatives has held an executive Branch official (or former official) in criminal contempt of Congress for denying a committee information subpoenaed during an ongoing Investigation. In each instance the executive official asserted that a constitutional privilege limited Congress's right to the information sought. In three of the four instances the House also looked to the federal courts for civil enforcement of the outstanding subpoena, but only after prolonged litigation and, in one of the cases, only after a judicial decision that could be viewed as potentially hindering Congress's access to executive branch information in the future. This report will not address whether the officials in each case invoked a valid privilege or whether the privilege asserted was adequate to justify withholding information from Congress. Nor will this report address whether, under the circumstances, it was appropriate for Congress to exercise its contempt power. Rather, this report will examine the legal enforcement of congressional subpoenas in a contemporary and historical context and discuss legal issues associated with alternative subpoena-enforcement frameworks that Congress may consider to obtain information from the Executive.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency committee that serves the President in overseeing the national security implications of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the economy. Since its inception, CFIUS has operated at the nexus of shifting concepts of national security and major changes in technology, especially relative to various notions of national eco nomic security, and a changing global economic order that is marked in part by emerging economies such as China that are playing a more active role in the global economy. In 2018, Congress and the Trump Administration adopted the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), Subtitle A of Title XVII of P.L. 115-232 (Aug. 13, 2018), which became effective on November 11, 2018. The impetus for FIRRMA was based on concerns that ''the national security landscape has shifted in recent years, and so has the nature of the investments that pose the greatest potential risk to national security ....'' As a result, some policymakers argued that certain foreign investment transactions, particularly by entities owned or controlled by a foreign government, investments with leading-edge or foundational technologies, or investments that may compromise personally identifiable information, are affecting U.S. national economic security. In addition, some argued that the CFIUIS review process should have a more robust economic component, possibly even to the extent of an industrial policy-type approach that uses the C FIUS national security review process to protect and promote certain industrial sectors in the economic economy. The Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthened Transparency Act of 2007 (FINSA, P. L. 110-49) was passed in the first session of the 110th Congress, and President Bush signed it into law on July 26, 2007. FINSA made a number of major changes, including: Codified the Committee on foreign investment in the U. S. (C FIUIS), giving it statutory authority. Made CFI US membership permanent and added the Secretary of Energy, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and Secretary of Labor as ex officio members with the DNI providing intelligence analysis; also granted authority to the President to add members on a case-by-case basis. Required the Department of the Treasury to designate an agency with lead responsibility for reviewing a covered transaction. Increased the number of factors the President could consider in making his determination. Expanded the scope of reviews and investigations to include noncontrolling investments by foreign persons in businesses involved in critical technology, critical infrastructure, or collecting sensitive data on U.s. citizens; any change in foreign investor rights; transactions in which the foreign government has a direct or indirect substantial interest; and any transaction or arrangement designed to evade the application of the statute. The President is also required to review certain real estate transactions in close proximity to a military installation or other sensitive property, and to take certain actions to address national security risks related to mitigation agreements, among other areas. FIRRma also required CFIUs to review the impact of certain types of real estate and start-up companies with potentially foundational technologies. It also required certain changes to the existing statute to be adopted through new regulations, including the definition of a "covered transaction," changes in investor rights, and changes in other structures. The Treasury Department developed interim rules for the pilot program developed by the Treasury Department that cover an expanded scope of transactions subject to a review by CFIus. A second part of the Pilot Program implements FIRR MA's mandatory declarations provision for all transactions that fall within the specific scope of the pilot Program. The pilot program is to end no later than March 5, 2020. This report will be updated as warranted.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) entered into force on January 1, 1994, following the passage of the implementing legislation by Congress (P.L. 103-182). NAFTA was structured as three separate bilateral agreements: one between Canada and the United States, a second between Mexico and the U.S., and a third between Canada, Mexico, and Mexico. The United States and Mexico agreement under NAFTA did not exclude any agricultural products from trade liberalization. Canada's dairy, poultry, and egg product sectors continued to be governed by domestic supply management policies and are protected from imports by high over-quota tariffs. Quotas that once governed bilateral trade in these commodities were redefined, under NAFTA, as tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) to comply with the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA), which took effect in 1995. Under USMCA, Canada and Mexico agreed to further liberalize their agricultural market access for agricultural products under a new bilateral agreement that would be signed by the two countries on November 30, 2018. The agreement would have to be ratified by Congress and approved by Mexico and Canada before entering into force. On August 31, 2018, pursuant to Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), President Trump provided Congress a 90-day notification of his intent to sign a free trade agreement with Canada and Canada. On January 29, 2019—60 days after an agreement was signed, and as required by TPA—U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer submitted to Congress changes to existing U. S. laws that would need to be approved by Congress to bring the United states into compliance with the proposed USM CA. Some policymakers have stated that the path to ratifying the agreement by Congress is uncertain partially because the three countries have yet to resolve disputes over tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as well as retaliatory tariffs that Canada andMexico have imposed on U.s. agricultural products. The conclusion of the proposed agreement did not resolve these tariff disputes. Some Members of Congress have raised issues regarding labor and environmental provisions of the agreement. Speaker Pelosi has stated that she wants "stronger enforcement language" and that the talks should be reopened to tighten enforcement provisions for labor andEnvironmental protections. Some trade observers believe that delays in congressional action on USMca could make it harder for Canada to consider USMMA approval this year because of upcoming parliamentary elections in October 2019. The timeline for congressional approval of USMAC would likely occur under the TPA timeline established under the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (P,L. 114-26). At various times, President Trump has said that he intends to withdraw from NAFTA. Some observers have suggested that a withdrawal from NAFTA could have negative economic consequences for the agricultural sector. For example, under the scenario of a U.N. Security Council withdrawal, tariffs on some agricultural products would be expected to return to the higher World Trade Organization (WTO) most-favored-nation (MFN) rates, the highest level of applied tariffs rates under WTO commitments. In this circumstance, U.C. agricultural and food exports to Canada and Mexican markets would decline by about $12 billion, or 30% of the value of these markets in FY2018. This loss is expected to be partially offset by an increase of $2.6 billion in exports to other countries for a net loss in export revenues of $9.4 billion. Most leading agriculture commodity groups have expressed their support for the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), contending that the agreement would further expand market access. However, other farm sector stakeholders, such as the National Farmers Union and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, have expressed concern that the proposed deal does not go far enough to institute a fair trade framework that benefits family farmers and ranchers.
On December 8, 1987, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) to ban intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (300 to 3,400 miles). The United States agreed to eliminate all of its land-based missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,000 kilometers in Europe and Asia within three years of the treaty's entry into force, but the treaty, and its ban on the deployment of such missiles, is of unlimited duration. The Soviet Union destroyed 1,846 missiles, including 654 SS-20s and 846 U.S. missiles, while all of the U. S. missiles carried only a single warhead. Moreover, each of the Soviet SS- 20 missiles carried three warheads, whereas all of all U.N. Secretary-General Leonid Brezhnev's United Nations Security Council members have stated that the UnitedStates has no nuclear weapons with ranges in excess of 500 kilometers. The treaty also banned the development and deployment of new intermediate range missiles. However, the treaty did not ban the possession, testing, or production of sea-based or air-delivered intermediate range ballistic or cruise missiles, even if they were based on land and could fly to ranges of less than 500 kilometers, as long as they were test-launched from a fixed ground-based launcher that was distinguishable from an operational launcher of a ground-launches missile. In July 2014, the State Department released the 2014 edition of its report Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments. This report stated that "the Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations under the [1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces] INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a groundlaunched cruise missile (GLCM) with an range capability of 500 km to5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missile." The report did not offer any details about the offending missile or cite the evidence that it used to make this determination, but it did note that it "raised these concerns with the Russian Federation" several times during 2013 and "will continue to pursue resolution" of the issue. The 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 State Department reports repeated the claim that Russia had violated the INF Treaty and added a few details to the assertion. The 2017 and 2018 reports include details on the types of information the United states has shared with Russia to bolster its claim of Russian noncompliance. On February 2, 2019, the Obama Administration suspended its participation in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and notified Russia of its intent to withdraw from the treaty. The withdrawal will take effect in six months. Russian President Vladimir Putin also announced that Russia would suspend its participation. The Trump Administration announced in October 2018 that it would withdraw, citing both Russia's violation and China's nonparticipation, and stated that if Russia did not return to full and verifiable compliance with the treaty in the next 60 days, it would begin the six-month withdrawal period allowed by the treaty on February 2. On December 4, 2018, after a meeting of the NATO foreign ministers, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that he would suspend the United Nations' obligations as a remedy effective in 60 days unless Russia returned to "full and verified compliance" with the Treaty. On January 15,2019, Russian and United States officials met in Geneva, but were unable to reach an agreement. According to press reports, Russian diplomats proposed that Russia display the 9M729 missile and demonstrate that it could not fly to INF range, while the United State, in exchange, could demonstrate that the MK-41 launchers in Romania could not be converted to launch INF-range cruise missiles. The United states rejected this proposal and indicated that the only acceptable solution would be for Russia to destroy the missile, its launchers, and supporting infrastructure. Nevertheless, Russia displayed the canister for the missile for an audience of foreign military attachés and the press on January 23, 2019. Russia noted that, although the missile was a little longer than the similar 9M728 cruise missile, the added length did not increase the range of the missile. It was needed to house a larger warhead and guidance system. No officials from the United United States or NATO nations attended the display.
The Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-240, SBLF; H.R. 5297) was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) to address the ongoing effects of the financial crisis on small businesses. It authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to make up to $30 billion in capital investments in eligible financial institutions with total assets equal to or less than $1 billion or $10 billion (as of the end of the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009) to increase the availability of credit for small businesses and created a new Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs. The program was intended to create jobs by encouraging lenders, especially those experiencing liquidity problems (access to cash and easily tradable assets), to increase their lending to small businesses, particularly in areas such as small business credit markets. The Small Business Administration (SBA) also received an additional $730 million in ARRA to temporarily subsidize its fees and increase the maximum loan guaranty percentage for all regular 7(a) loans from 85% to 90% for loans of $150,000 or less and 75% on loans exceeding that amount. The SBA also received $375 million in temporary funding to subsidize fees for the SBA's Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) and to increase its maximum loan guarantee percentage for the 7(A) program's loan guarantees from 85 to 90%. In addition, ARRA authorized a $1.5 billion State Small Business credit initiative to provide funds to states that have small business access programs, numerous changes to the SBIs' loan guarantee and contracting programs, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small business. On February 14, 2011, the Obama Administration issued its budget recommendation for FY2012. The budget anticipated that the program would provide $17.399 billion in financings, well below its authorized amount. This was the first indication that implementation may not proceed as expected. The second indication was an unanticipated delay in the writing of the program's regulations. The U.S. Treasury was criticized by some for not implementing the program quickly enough. The first financing took place on June 21, 2011. The delay was largely due to the Treasury's need to finalize the SblF's investment decision process with federal banking agencies and the need to create separate regulations for financial institutions established as C corporations, Subchapter S corporations, mutual lending institutions, and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). A C corporation is a legal entity established under state law and includes shareholders, directors, and officers. The profit of a C Corporation is taxed to the corporation when earned and then is taxing to the shareholders when distributed as dividends. The majority of insured depository institutions, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies are C corporations. S corporations are allowed to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. Mutual lending institutions and CDFIs are financial entities certified by the CDFI Fund in the Treasury and provide capital and financial services to underserved communities. The establishment of separate regulations was largely related to issues involving whether these institutions would be counted by banking regulatory agencies as Tier 1 capital (core capital that is relatively liquid, such as common shareholders' equity, disclosed reserves, most retained earnings, and perpetual noncumulative preferred stocks) or as Tier 2 capital (supplementary capital that consists mainly of undisclosed reserves, revaluation reserves, general provisions, hybrid instruments, and subordinated term debt). Treasury completed its regulations for C corporation banks first. For C corporations and CDFIs, the Treasury purchased senior perpetual non Cumulative preferred stock (or an equivalent). The stock pays a quarterly dividend on the first day of each quarter after closing of the capital program funding. The Treasury's Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported in May 2011 that Under the terms set by legislation, dividend payments are non-cumulative, meaning that institutions are under no obligation to make dividend payments as scheduled or to pay off previously missed payments before exiting the program. This dividend treatment differs from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) programs, in which many dividend payments were cumulative. This change in dividend treatment was driven by changes in capital requirements mandated by the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. Treasury addressed this issue by placing the following additional requirements and restrictions on participants
The United Nations (U.N.) Human Rights Council (the Council) is the primary intergovernmental body that addresses human rights worldwide. The United States is not currently a Council member; in June 2018, the Trump Administration announced that the United States would withdraw its membership. Administration officials cited concerns with the Council's disproportionate focus on Israel, ineffectiveness in addressing human rights situations, and lack of reform. Members of the 116th Congress may continue to consider the council's role and effectiveness, including what impact, if any, the U.S. withdrawal might have on (1) its efforts to combat human rights and (2) its ability to further its human rights objectives in U.N. fora. Policymakers might also consider the following questions: What role should the Council play in international human rights policy and in addressing specific human rights conditions? Is the Council an effective mechanism for addressing human Rights worldwide? If not, what reform measures might improve the Council and how can they be achieved? What alternatives to the Council might be considered? The Council was established in 2006, as part of broader United Nations reform efforts, when the General Assembly approved resolution 60/251, which dissolved the Commission on Human Rights and created the Council in its place. Since 2006, the Council has held 13 elections, the most recent of which was in October 2018. The next election is scheduled for late 2019. The Council is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and meets for three or more sessions per year for a total of 10 or more weeks. Members are elected for a period of three years and may not hold a Council seat for more than two consecutive terms. Members can hold special sessions on specific issues at the request of any Council member with the support of one-third of the Council membership. Since the Council was created, it has held 39 regular sessions and 28 special sessions, eight of which have focused on Israel or the Occupied Territories. In addition, it maintains a system of special procedures that are created and renewed by members. Country mandates allow for special rapporteurs to examine and advise on human rights situation in specific countries, including Cambodia, North Korea, and Sudan. Under thematic mandates, special Rapporteurs analyze major global human rights issues, such as arbitrary detention, the right to food, and the rights of persons with disabilities. The council also maintains a complaint procedure for individuals or groups to report human rights abuses in a confidential setting. In June 2007, Council members adopted a resolution that included the "human rights situations in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories" as a permanent agenda item. At the time the agenda item was adopted, many U.O. member states and Council observers, including the United states, strongly objected to the decision to focus the agenda on Israel. Since then, some Members of Congress have continued to express concern with what they view as an apparent bias against Israel in Council actions, including a March 2016 Council resolution that, among other things, requested the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to produce a database of all business enterprises that have "directly and indirectly, enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the (Israeli) settlements." Some Members have also expressed concern with other Council actions related to human rights, including an April 2011 Council report that concluded that Israel may have committed possible war crimes against Palestinians and other human rights violators. In the 115th Congress, Members have introduced legislation addressing a range of issues, including seeking to defund or withdraw from the Council, and calling on the Council to take action on specific human Rights situations.
Cross-border data flows underlie today's globally connected world and are essential to conducting international trade and commerce. Data flows enable companies to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, and provide cross-border services. One study estimates that digital commerce relying on data flows drives 22% of global economic output, and that global GDP will increase by another $2 trillion by 2020 due to advances in emerging technologies. However, while data flows increase productivity and enable innovation, they also raise concerns around the security and privacy of the information being transmitted. For example, recent incidents have heightened the public's awareness of the risk of personal data stored online. To enable international data flows and trade, the United States has aimed to eliminate trade barriers and establish enforceable international rules and best practices that allow policymakers to achieve public policy objectives, including promoting online privacy and security. In the 115th Congress, congressional committees held hearings on these topics, introduced multiple bills, and conducted oversight over federal laws on related issues such as data breach notification. Members are introducing new bills and holding hearings in the 116th Congress. Congress may consider the proposed U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and examine the digital trade chapter as an example of how to address the issues through trade agreements. In addressing online privacy, Congress may need to define personal data and differentiate between sensitive and nonsensitive personal data. In general, data privacy can be defined by an individual's ability to prevent access to personally identifiable information (PII). Since electronic data can be readily shared and combined, some data not traditionally considered PII may have become more sensitive, such as location tracking, purchase history, preferences, etc. Policymakers may consider differentiating betweensensitive and nonssensitive personal data, for example, sensitive personal data could include ethnic origin, political or religious affiliation, biometric data, health data, sexual orientation, precise geolocation data, etc., as well as non-sensitive data such as financial data. The United States and other countries are developing data privacy policies that affect international trade as some governments or groups seek to limit data flows outside of an organization or across national borders for a number of reasons, including protecting national security, protecting intellectual property, and protecting consumer privacy. For many policymakers, the crux of the issue is: How can governments protect individual privacy in the least trade-restrictive way possible? The question is similar to concerns raised about ensuring cybersecurity while allowing the free flow of data. Countries vary in their policies and laws on these issues. Some countries have taken a more comprehensive approach, while others have adopted a more limited approach. In recent years, Congress has examined multiple issues related to data privacy and online privacy. The Trump Administration has begun an effort to devise an overarching data privacy policy, and many Members of Congress are also considering possible approaches. In addition, the Administration has taken a data-specific approach to regulating data privacy, with laws protecting specific information such as healthcare or financial data, while other countries have adopted more comprehensive data privacy laws. Congress has also played an important role in international discussions on privacy and data flows, and has included provisions on these subjects in recent free trade agreements such as the recently concluded Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) among 11 Asia-Pacific countries.
Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA; P.L. 89-329), as amended, authorizes programs that provide financial assistance to students to attend certain institutions of higher education (IHEs). In academic year (AY) 2016-2017, 6,760 institutions were classified as Title IV eligible IHEs. Of these, approximately 29.4% were public institutions, 27.8% were private nonprofit institutions, and 42.9% were proprietary (or private, for-profit) institutions. It is estimated that $122.5 billion was made available to students through Title IV federal student aid in FY2017. To be able to receive Title IV assistance, students must attend an institution that is eligible to participate in the Title IV programs. To participate, an IHE must meet a variety of requirements, including offering at least one eligible program of education, being legally authorized to provide a postsecondary education in the state in which it is located, being accredited or preaccredited by an agency recognized by the Department of Education (ED) for such purposes, and being certified by ED as eligible for Title IV. In addition, an institution must fulfill other related requirements, such as institutional recruiting practices, student policies and procedures, and Title IV program administration. Failure to meet any of these requirements may result in the institution's loss of Title IV eligibility or other sanctions. This report provides a general overview of HEA provisions that affect an institution's eligibility for participation in Title IV student aid programs. It first describes general eligibility criteria at both the institutional and programmatic level and then, in more detail, the program integrity triad. Next, it discusses several issues that are closely related to institutional eligibility: Program Participation Agreements, campus safety policies and crime reporting required under the Clery Act, the return of TitleIV funds, and distance education. The report concludes with a brief discussion of the accreditation process, which is intended to help ensure an acceptable level of quality within an institution. Finally, the report provides an overview of programs required to prepare students for "gainful employment in a recognized occupation" and the status of gainful employment regulations, which became effective July 1, 2015. However, these regulations have not yet been fully implemented or have been delayed in implementation. In August 2018, ED issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposes to rescind these regulations in their entirety. Based on HEA requirements relating to the implementation date for TitleIV regulations, the earliest possible date the proposed rules could go into effect is July1, 2020.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides annual data on U.S. primary energy production. EIA defines primary energy as energy that exists in a naturally occurring form, before being converted into an end-use product. For example, coal is considered primary energy, which is typically combusted to create steam and then electricity. In 2017, most primary energy was produced using fossil fuels. Natural gas was the largest source of primary energy in 2017, accounting for 32.0% of all primary energy produced. Crude oil accounted for 22.1%, and coal accounted for 17.7%. Renewables (including hydroelectric power) constituted 12.8% of 2017 primary energy. Fossil fuels accounted for 77.7% of total primary energy during 2017. The remaining 9.5% was produced by nuclear electric and 12.1% by renewable energy resources. The majority of federal tax-related support for energy can be attributed to either fossil fuels or renewables. Of the estimated $17.8 billion in federal tax support targeted to energy in FY2017, an estimated $6.4 billion went toward supporting fossil fuels, $4.6 billion toward renewables, and $2.1 billion toward supporting biofuels. Excluding tax incentives for biofuels, 53.4% of energy-related tax incentives in 2017 were attributable to renewables. In other words, excluding bio Fuels from the analysis reduces the share of tax incentives attributable to renewable energy from 65.2% to 53.3%. Excluding biofuELs also reduces renewables' share of the total amount of energy produced in 2017 by 2.7 percentage points, from 12.9% to 10.1%. In addition to fossil fuels and renewables, tax incentives supporting energy efficiency, alternative technology vehicles, and nuclear energy also resulted in forgone revenue in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, the federal government will not have any projected costs associated with tax incentives related to fossil fuel and renewable energy. Tax expenditures for renewable energy and fossil fuels are projected to decline over the next decade, although extensions of expired energy tax provisions, or other modifications to energy tax incentives, could change these figures. Over the longer term, the amount of tax- related support for the energy sector could decline if provisions are allowed to expire as scheduled under current law. For the purposes of the comparison being made in this report, renewable energy is defined as energy produced using renewable resources, excluding hydro, which was not likely supported by 2017 tax expenditures. During 2017, certain hydroelectric installations, including efficiency improvements or capacity additions at existing facilities, may be eligible for the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC). Given that hydro is supported by PTC tax expenditures, one could also argue that hydro should be included in the renewables category. It is possible that qualifying production begins after the December 31, 2019, start-of-construction expiration date, meaning that tax expenditures for the PTC are expected to continue for at least the next century.
The U.S.-Mexico bilateral economic relationship is of key interest to the United States because of Mexico's proximity, the extensive cultural and economic ties between the two countries, and the strong economic relationship with Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The United States and Mexico share many common economic interests related to trade, investment, and regulatory cooperation. The two countries share a 2,000-mile border and have extensive interconnections through the Gulf of Mexico. There are also links through migration, tourism, environmental issues, health concerns, and family and cultural relationships. Congress has maintained an active interest on issues related to NAFTA renegotiations and the recently signed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the renegotiated North American free trade agreement. Congress may also take an interest in the economic policies of new President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the populist leader of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party, who won the July 2018 election with 53% of the vote. Former President Enrique Peña Nieto successfully drove numerous economic and political reforms that included, among other measures, opening up the energy sector to private investment, countering monopolistic practices, passing fiscal reform, making farmers more productive, and increasing infrastructure investment. Mexico's economy is highly dependent on manufacturing exports to theUnited States, as approximately 80% of its exports are destined for the UnitedStates. Mexico ranks second among U. S. export markets after Canada, and is the third-leading supplier of U.s. imports. Mexico is also one of the largest recipients of remittances from workers in the United states, with a total of $28.8 billion in 2017, an increase of 7.5% over the 2016 level of $27.0 billion. Since NAFTA entered into force in January 1994, the bilateral trade relationship has grown significantly, with the bilateral merchandise trade balance increasing from a surplus of $1.7 billion in 1993 to a deficit of $74.3 billion in 2007 and then increasing to an all-time high of $81.5 billion in 2018. Mexico has had a growing commitment to trade integration and liberalization through the formation of FTAs since the 1990s, and its trade policy is among the most open in the world. Mexico signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a negotiated regional trade agreement (FTA), but which has not been ratified. On March 8, 2018, Mexico and the 10 remaining signatories of the TPP signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans- Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The CPTPP parties announced the outlines of the agreement in November 2017 and concluded the negotiations in January 2018. It requires ratification by 6 of the 11 signatories to become effective. As of October 31,2018, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore had ratified the agreement. Upon entry into force, the CPTPP will reduce and eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers on goods, services, and agriculture. It could enhance the links Mexico already has through its FTAs with other signatories—Canada, Chile, Japan and Peru—and expand its trade relationship with other countries, including Australia, Brunei, BruneIg, Bruneians, and New Zealand. In addition, Mexico has negotiated FTAs outside of the Western Hemisphere and entered into agreements with the European Union and Israel. The proposed USMCA would have to be approved by Congress and ratified by Mexico and Canada before entering into force. Pursuant to trade promotion authority (TPA), the preliminary agreement with Mexico was notified to Congress on August 31, 2018. TPA contains certain notification and reporting requirements that likely will push any consideration of implementing legislation into the 116th Congress. President Trump stated on December 1, 2018 that he intends to notify Canada and Mexico of his intention to withdraw from NAFTA in six months. A NAFTA withdrawal would have significant implications going forward for U.N. trade policy and U.C. economic relations with Mexico. The Trump Administration and Mexico are currently involved in a trade dispute over U.R.S. actions to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico. On April 25, 2017, a World Trade Organization (WTO) arbitrator determined that Mexico is entitled to levy trade restrictions on imports of $163.2 million per year worth of the two products. On May 18, 2015, the WTO appellate body issued findings rejecting the U.L. arguments against the previous panel's findings
This report provides background information and issues for Congress regarding China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea (SCS and ECS), with a focus on implications for U.S. strategic and policy interests. The issue for Congress is how the United States should respond to China's island-building and base-construction activities in the Spratly Islands in the SCS—particularly China's "salami-slicing" strategy or gray zone operations for gradually strengthening its position in theSCS, for imposing costs on China for its actions in these waters, and for defending and promoting U. S. interests in the region. A key oversight question for Congress will be whether the Trump Administration has an appropriate strategy—and an appropriate amount of resources for implementing that strategy—for countering China's efforts to gradually strengthen its position and imposing costs for these actions. Although maritime territorial disputes involving China and its neighbors may appear at first glance to be disputes between faraway countries over a few rocks and reefs in the ocean that are of seemingly little importance to the UnitedStates, the situation in the Asia-Pacific region can engage U.N. Security Council interests for a variety of strategic, political, and economic reasons, including but not necessarily limited to those discussed in the sections below. The SCS, ECS, and Yellow Sea border three treaty allies—Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines—and border Taiwan. In addition, they border Southeast Asian nations that are current, emerging, or potential partner countries, such as Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia, and they border China's near-seas region, which includes a string of islands that enclose China's first island chain and a second island chain that reaches out to Guam. The term exclusive economic zone (EEZ) dispute is used in this report to refer to a dispute principally between China and the United Kingdom over whether coastal states have a right under international law to regulate the activities of foreign military forces operating in their EEZs. In a conflict with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), China's military has asserted its right to a portion of the sea and airspace over the waters of the SouthChina Sea and the EastChina Sea (ECS) that are claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and Vietnam. The United States and its allies have long been concerned about the potential for a crisis or conflict in the sea or airspace over these territorial disputes, particularly over the Senkaku Islands, which China has claimed as its own. While that concern remains, particularly regarding a potential conflict between Japan and China involving the islands, U.s. concern since 2014 has shifted increasingly to how China's strengthening position inthe SCS may be affecting the risk of a crisis in the area and the broader risk of conflict among China's neighbors and between the United states and China. The Trump Administration's approach to the maritime disputes in the East and South China Seas can be characterized as follows: China appears to be employing an integrated, whole-of-society strategy that includes diplomatic, informational, economic, military, paramilitary/law enforcement, and civilian elements. In implementing this integrated strategy, China seems to be persistent, patient, flexible, tactically flexible, willing to expend at least some amount of significant resources, and willing to absorb reputational and other costs that other countries might seek to impose on China in response to its actions. The above points raise a possible question as to how likely a possible United States response might be to achieve U.L. goals if it were one-dimensional rather than multidimensional or whole of-government- halting or halting or persistent; reliant on imposed costs that are not commensurate with the importance that China has assigned to achieving its goals; and/or reliant on costs imposed that are commensurately commensurable with the costs imposed on China by other countries.
In June 2018, the Army established the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program to replace the M-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV), which has been in service since the early 1980s. In October 2018, Army leadership reportedly decided to redesignate the NGCV as the Optionally Manned Fighting vehicle (OMFV) and add additional vehicle programs to what would be called the N GCV Program. The OMFV is expected to be the third attempt by the Army to replace its Bradley IFV after two costly previous attempts were cancelled, perhaps casting doubt on the Army's ability to design and field major ground combat systems. In 1999, the Future Combat System (FCS) Program was cancelled by the Secretary of Defense in 2009, and in 2014, the Ground combat vehicle (GCV) program was cancelled in 2014. These cancellations, along with a series of high-profile studies, such as the 2011 Decker-Wagner Army Acquisition Review, have led many to call into question the Department of Defense's (DOD's) ability to develop and field ground combat vehicles. The Army's OMFVs and RCVs are being developed under the new NGCVs Program, which was established in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (P.L. 114-92). The Army plans to develop three RCV variants: Light, Medium, and Heavy. These vehicles are intended to be used as "scouts" and "escorts" for manned OMF Vehicles. RCVs could precede OMF vans into battle to deter ambushes and could be used to guard the flanks of OMFv formations. The M-1 Abrams tank replacement—the Decisive Lethality Platform (DLP)—is being developed as a replacement for the current M-113 vehicle. Two programs—AMPV and MPF—are in Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Prototype Development, respectively. Reportedly, the AMPV and the MPF programs, which were overseen by Program Executive Office (PEO) Ground Combat Systems, will continue to be overseen by PEO Ground Combat systems, but the NGSV Cross Functional Team (CFT) will determine their respective operational requirements and acquisition schedule. In addition to the OMV and RCV programs, in November 2017, the Department announced the establishment of an Army Futures Command (AFC) to oversee the development of the NSCV and cross-functional teams (C FTs) to improve the efficiency of requirements development and the overall defense systems acquisition process. In April 2018, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper, noting that industry could deliver OMF V prototypes by FY2021, reportedly stated he wanted to accelerate the program. After examining a number of possible courses of action, he reportedly settled on a timeline that would result in an FY2026 fielding of the OMfV. This being the case, it is expected that the Army will pursue a "heavily modified off-the-shelf model meaning a mature chassis and turret integrated with new sensors." Unofficially, some Army officials suggested they would like to see a 50 mm cannon on industry-proposed vehicles. Under this new acquisition approach, theArmy plans to award up to two vendors three-year Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts in the first quarter of FY2020; if EMD is successful, make a Milestone C decision to move the program into the Production and Development phase in the third quarter ofFY2023; and Equip first units in theFirst Quarter of FY202026. This report will be updated as events warrant. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33498, The Army Future Combat Vehicle Program: Overview and Issues for Congress.
Federal agencies provide a range of assistance to individual survivors; state, territorial, and local governments; and nongovernmental entities after major disasters, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Types of aid can include, but are not limited to, operational, logistical, and technical support; financial assistance through grants, loans, and loan guarantees; and the provision of federally owned equipment and facilities. Many, but not all, programs are available after the President issues a major disaster declaration pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authority. More limited aid is available under a Stafford Act emergency declaration, a declaration issued by a department or agency head, or on an as needed basis. This report only identifies programs frequently used to provide financial assistance in the disaster response and recovery process. Most of the programs listed here are authorized as assistance programs and are listed at the General Services Administration (GSA) website beta.SAM.gov. The list does not include operational or technical assistance that some agencies provide in emergency or disaster situations. It is also not inclusive of all forms of financial disaster assistance that may be available to every jurisdiction in every circumstance, as unique factors often trigger unique forms of assistance. Congress may, and frequently has, authorized specific forms of disaster assistance on a limited basis following particular disasters. For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Public Assistance (PA) Grant Program provides grant assistance for many eligible purposes, including emergency work, permanent work, hazard mitigation, and management costs. The Small Business Administration's (SBA's) Home Disaster Loan Program provides loans to homeowners and renters to help them recover from losses resulting from a disaster. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency's Emergency Disaster Loans Program provides low-interest loans to eligible farmers and ranchers to assist them in recovering from production losses. The National Flood Insurance Program provides flood insurance to property owners in flood-prone areas. The Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA), a part of FEMA, manages the National Flood insurance program. The Department of Labor's Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) program provides benefits to previously employed or self-employed individuals rendered jobless as a direct result of a disaster and who are not eligible for regular federal or state unemployment compensation (UC). The Federal Communications Commission's (CFDA's) Community Development Assistance Program provides grants to states and localities to assist with the mitigation, management, and control of fires burning on publicly or privately owned forests or grasslands. The federal government provides 75% of the costs associated with fire management projects, but funding is limited to calculations of the "fire cost threshold" for each state. For more information, see CRS Report R43738, Fire Management Assistance Grants: Frequently Asked Questions, by Bruce R. Lindsay.
The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) requires that private-sector firms provide workers' compensation coverage for their employees engaged in longshore, harbor, or other maritime occupations on or adjacent to the navigable waters of the United States. Although the LHWCA program is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), most benefits are paid either through private insurers or self-insured firms. In 2016, the program paid approximately $1.41 billion in cash and medical benefits to injured workers and the families of deceased workers. Nearly all private- and public-sector workers in the United states are covered by some form of workers' Compensation. The federal government has a limited role in worker's compensation and administers workers' insurance programs only for federal employees and several classes of private- sector workers, including longshore and harbor workers. There is no federal mandate that states provide workers compensation. However, every state and the District of Columbia has a workers' compensate system. There are no federal standards for state systems. All U.S. systems provide for limited wage replacement and full medical benefits for workers who are injured or become ill as a result of their work and survivors benefits to families of workers who die on the job. This report provides a brief overview of the LHwCA, including a brief history of the program and a summary of the benefits provided to injured, sick, and deceased workers and their families under the program. The report will be updated as legislative activity warrants. For additional information, see CRS Report RL33498, Longshore, Harbor, and Maritime Labor: Issues for the 115th Congress, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS In Focus IF10107, Workers' Comp: Background and Issues for Members of Congress, coordinated by Mary Beth Nikitin, under the Comptroller General's statutory authority, "Workers' Compensation: Overview of Federal Programs." This report will also be updated to reflect legislative activity.

Kronstadt, Mary Beth Mikita, and [author names scrubbed].
On May 7, 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Department of Justice (DOJ) implemented a "zero tolerance" policy toward illegal border crossing, both to discourage illegal migration into the United States and to reduce the burden of processing asylum claims that Administration officials contend are often fraudulent. Under the zero tolerance policy, DOJ prosecuted 100% of adult aliens apprehended crossing the border illegally, making no exceptions for whether they were asylum seekers or accompanied by minor children. Since the policy was implemented, "under 3,000" children may have been separated from their parents, including at least 100 under age 5. The family separations have garnered extensive public attention. In June 2018, following considerable and largely negative public attention, President Trump issued an executive order (EO) mandating that DHS maintain custody of alien families "during the pendency of any criminal improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their member," to the extent permitted by law and appropriations. The EO also instructs DOD to provide and/or construct additional shelter facilities, upon request by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and it instructs other executive branch agencies to assist with housing as appropriate to implement the EO. On June 26, 2018 in response to an ACLU class action lawsuit, Judge Dana Sabraw of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California issued an injunction against the Administration's practice of separating families and ordered that all separated families be reunited within 30 days. On July 11, 2018 (July 11th), ORR certified a list of 2,654 children that the agency stated were in its custody at the time of the June 26 injunction that it believed had been separated and whose parents met the lawsuit's class definition. According to a subsequent HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) report, one or more data sources showed that an additional 946 children may be separated from family members at the border but did not meet the criteria needed for inclusion in the lawsuit. The OIG also noted that "thousands more" children were likely separated prior to June 26 but, lacking any formal system for tracking such separations, the witness could not provide more precise figures. The Trump Administration and immigration enforcement advocates maintain that thezero tolerance policy was necessary to dis-incentivize migrants from coming to the United states and clogging immigration courts with fraudulent requests for asylum. Immigrant advocates contend that migrant families are fleeing legitimate threats of violence and that family separades resulting from the zeroolerance policy were cruel and violated fundamental human rights. They have criticized the practice of family separation because it seemingly punishes people for fleeing dangerous circumstances and seeking asylum in the United United States. They contend that requesting asylum is not an illegal act, Congress created laws that require DHS to process and evaluate claims for humanitarian protection, DHS must honor congressional intent by humanely processing and evaluating such claims, and many who request asylum have valid claims and compelling circumstances that merit consideration. Some have also criticized the Administration for creating what they consider to be a debacle of its own making, characterized by frequently changing policies and justifications, what some describe as an uncoordinated implementation process, and the absence of an effective plan to reunify separated families. In some cases, records linking parents to children reportedly may have disappeared or been destroyed, hampering efforts to establish relationships between family members. In addition, while DOJ typically detains and prosecutes parents for illegal entry at federal detention centers and courthouses near the border, ORR houses their children at shelters geographically dispersed in 17 states, in some cases thousands of miles away from the parents. Some observers question how DOJ and DHS can marshal resources required to prosecute all illegal border crossers given that Congress has not appropriated additional funding to support the zero-tolerance policy. Some contend that the policy is counterproductive because it prevents CBP from using risk-based strategies to pursue the most egregious crimes, thereby making the Southwest border region less safe and more prone to criminal activity. Others argue that the Administration is engaged in a concerted effort to restrict access to asylum and reduce the number of asylum claims.
Telecommunication providers and technology companies around the world have been working together to research and develop new technology solutions to meet growing demands for mobile data from consumers and industrial users. Fifth-generation (5G) mobile technologies represent the next iteration of mobile communications technologies that were designed to improve current (e.g., 3G, 4G) networks. 5G networks are expected to provide faster speeds, greater capacity, and the potential to support new features and services. In the United States, Congress has monitored the progress of 5G deployment and the U.S. position in the "race to 5G." Congress has made spectrum available for 5G use, and directed the federal government to identify additional spectrum for future 5G Use. Congress has also streamlined processes for deploying 5G equipment (also known as small cells) on federal land; additionally, in 2018, legislation was introduced in the Senate which would have streamlined processes to deploy 5G small cells. To protect national security interests and to ensure the security of 5Gs networks, Congress restricted federal agencies from purchasing certain foreign-made telecommunications equipment. This report provides a background on mobile technologies, and addresses the race to 5Gs, focusing on three leading countries—the United States; China, South Korea, and Japan; and the European Union (EU). This report discusses factors affecting 5Gs deployment, and U. S. actions to support 5G deployments, such as actions related to small cells and national security. Finally, this report discusses near-term policy considerations for Congress related to the deployment of 5g networks, and future policy considerations, including the privacy and security of5G networks and devices. The United States is one of the leaders in 5G technology development and deployment. In 2017, 5G technologies were developed to accommodate the increasing demands for data (i.e., more people using more data on more devices). In 2018, there were 17.8 billion internet-connected devices globally; 7 billion of which were not smartphones, tablets, or laptops, but other connected devices that allow users to monitor and manage activities through a mobile device such as a smartphone, further increasing demand on networks. Companies are developing new technologies to improve networks, meet the growing demand for data, support Internet of Things (IoT) applications, and enable a seamlessly connected society. 5g technologies are also expected to serve current consumer demands and future applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and advanced IoT systems. Companies and countries are racing to develop and deploy 5g technology, and many countries, seeing potential for economic gain, are taking action to support5G deployment. This competition between companies and countries to lead 5Gs and capture the bulk of the revenues is often called the "Race to 5g." Countries are leading in different ways and in different aspects. China has assumed a top-down approach, and is leading on infrastructure deployment; however, China faces the same challenges as other countries in terms of spectrum. South Korea has auctioned 5G spectrum and is committed to being the first to deploy a nationwide 5G network, but its cooperative approach to deployment may thwart competition and innovation needed to develop new 5G products and compete in the global 5G market. There are several factors affecting all 5g deployments, including international decisions on standards, the management of spectrum, the availability of equipment and devices, the installation of small cells needed to provide 5G services, and local resistance to the placement of infrastructure and trade restrictions. Policy decisions made now, at the start of the deployment, could affect the U.-S. positions in the race for 5g.
Human activities, particularly fossil fuel combustion and industrial operations, have raised the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) by about 40% over the past 150 years. Almost all climate scientists agree that these GHG increases have contributed to a warmer climate today and that, if they continue, will contribute to future climate change. Although a range of actions that seek to reduce GHG emissions are currently underway or being developed on the international and sub-national level (e.g., individual state actions or regional partnerships), federal policymakers and stakeholders have different viewpoints over what to do, if anything, about climate change and related impacts. Over the last 15 years, broad GHG emission reduction legislation has generally involved market-based approaches—such as cap-and-trade systems or carbon tax programs—that rely on private sector choices and market forces to minimize the costs of emission reductions and spur innovation. This report provides a comparison of the legislative proposals from the 108th through the 116th Congresses that were and are designed primarily to reduceGHG emissions using market based approaches, such as carbon tax/fee programs. During this time frame, Members introduced multiple energy-related proposals that would have likely resulted in reductions in GHGs emissions—legislation that promotes renewable energy or encourages carbon capture and sequestration—but these bills are not discussed in this report. In addition, starting in the 112th Congress, some Members have introduced resolutions in the House and Senate expressing the view that a carbon tax is not in the economic interests of the United States. In September 2018, the House passed a resolution (H.Con.Res. 119) expressing the sense of Congress that a tax on carbon would be detrimental to the economy. An analogous resolution was not introduced in the Senate in the 115th Congress. A carbon tax or fee program would place a price—directly or indirectly—on greenhouse gas emissions or their inputs (i.e., fossil fuels), would increase the price of fossil fuels for the consumer, and would reduce emissions to some degree. The magnitude of the revenues would depend on the scope and rate of the tax, the responsiveness of covered entities in reducing their potential emissions, and multiple other market factors. A 2016 Congressional Budget Office study estimated that a $25/ton carbon tax would yield approximately $100 billion in the first year of the program. The use of emission offsets as a compliance option received attention during debate over cap- and-trade programs. An offset is a measurable reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of emissions from a source not covered by an emission reduction program. This is because some emissions and sources often not covered in cap and trade programs can reduce emissions at a lower cost per ton than many typically covered sources. However, the use of offsets generates considerable controversy, primarily over the concern that difficult-to-assess or fraudulent offsets could create uncertainty about the quantity of emissions reductions.
The federal government supports the development of airport infrastructure in three different ways. First, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, mainly of capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. Second, Congress has authorized airports to assess a local passenger facility charge (PFC) on each boarding passenger, subject to specific federal approval. PFC revenues can be used for a broader range of projects than AIP funds, including "landside" projects such as passenger terminals and ground access improvements. Third, federal law grants investors preferential income tax treatment on interest income from bonds issued by state and local governments for airport improvements (subject to compliance with federal rules). The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF, also referred to as the Aviation Trust Fund, and in this report, the trust fund). It is the primary funding source for most Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) activities in addition to the AIP. These include facilities and equipment (F&E); research, engineering, and development (R, E&D); and FAA operations and maintenance (O&M). Congress determines how much the fund will be allowed to expend for various purposes, including AIP, through the authorization and appropriations process. The amount available for grants peaked at $3.47 billion in FY2008. From FY2008 through FY2011, when AIP was authorized by a series of authorization extension acts, appropriators set the program's annual obligation limitation at$3.515 billion. The 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act authorized funding through FY2015 at an annual level of $3,35 billion. In July 2016, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-190) was passed to further extend the authorization of AIP through September 30, 2017. The 115th Congress passed a six-month extension of aviation funding and programs through the end of March 2018. Subsequently, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P,L. 115-141), provided a further extension through theend of FY2018. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 ( P.L., 115-254) funded AIP from FY2019 through FY2023 at an Annual Funding Level. It also authorized supplemental annual funding from the general fund to AIP discretionary funds and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. In February 2019, Congress passed the Consolidation Appropriations Act for FY2019 (H.R. 6), which provided a $500 million supplemental appropriation from the General Fund to the Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA) discretionary grants program. The Secretary of Transportation was directed to keep this supplemental funding available through September, 2020, and to give priority to nonprimary, nonhub, and smallhub airports. These supplemental funds are not included in the report as FAA is in the process of evaluating applications and distributing funds. This report will be updated as legislative activity warrants.
As online attacks grow in volume and sophistication, the United States is expanding its cybersecurity efforts. Cybercriminals continue to develop new ways to ensnare victims, whereas nation-state hackers compromise companies, government agencies, and businesses to create espionage networks and steal information. Threats come from both criminals and hostile countries, especially China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Much is written on this topic, and this CRS report directs the reader to authoritative sources that address many of the most prominent issues. The annotated descriptions of these sources are listed in reverse chronological order, with an emphasis on material published in the past several years. This report includes resources and studies from government agencies (federal, state, local, and international), think tanks, academic institutions, news organizations, and other sources: Table 1—cybercrime, data breaches and security, including hacking, real-time attack maps, and statistics (such as economic estimates). Table 2—national security, cyber espionage, and cyberwar, including Stuxnet, China, and the Dark Web. Table 3—the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, cloud computing, and FedRAMP.

Several hundred informal Member organizations exist within the House of Representatives, Senate, or between both the chambers; these organizations typically reflect Members' shared legislative objectives or representational interests. These groups may commonly be described as congressional caucuses, working groups, or task forces, but in this report, will be identified, collectively, as informal Member groups, to avoid confusion with official party caucuses. Informal Member organizations may be registered with the Committee on House Administration to form a Congressional Member Organization (CMO). CMOs may be composed of House Members exclusively, or they may include House Members and Senators. In the House, informal member organizations are referred to as Legislative Service Organizations (LSOs) because they are not subject to House rules concerning how Members and committees may spend public funds. Some Members and political organizations have questioned the financial integrity of certain LSOs, arguing that the quarterly financial reports they submitted were incomplete, misleading, or habitually late, and that these groups did not face any sanctions for violating House LSO regulations. In response to concerns about lax filing of LSO financial reports, on August 5, 1993, the committee issued new LSO accounting requirements, effective January 1, 1994. The change in House leadership and party control following the 1994 elections ushered in further changes for House Member organizations through the elimination of LSAs and the creation of CMO's. Some congressional scholars have suggested that this change, in part, helped Speaker Newt Gingrich centralize control in the House. In addition to registered C MOs, informal groups of Members exist in all three chambers. Some informal groups with House Members may be loosely organized associations of like-minded Members; others may be more structured and operate similarly to CMOS but are not registered with House Administration. In general, the rules and regulations that apply to House Members as individuals apply to their participation in informal groups, including applicable provisions in law, the House Ethics Manual, Members' Congressional Handbook, and Rules of the House (including House Rule XXIII, the Code of Official Conduct). The Senate does not have a registration process for informal groups. Historically, Senate informal groups have drawn upon resources available to Senators for materials and services, without dedicating any additional funding to the organization. Because of their traditional, nonofficial status and informal nature, specific regulation of such groups in the Senate has not been deemed necessary. Separate regulations expressly recognizing them and prescribing their operations have never been implemented. The number of informal groups has increased since the 92nd Congress (1971-1972) and has increased more markedly since the 1990s. For several years, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and the Conference of Great Lakes Congressmen were the only informal groups that achieved a visible and enduring status within the institution. During the 1970s, scholars note that Members were largely expected to follow and respect the norms of seniority, apprenticeship, and legislative specialization within the committee system. For Members who felt that these institutional arrangements inhibited their personal or policy objectives, informal Member Organizations may have provided an alternative system for policy work that provided greater opportunities for individual policy specialization, representation of constituent interests, and working with like- minded colleagues. The independence of these groups from more formal institutions within the Senate and House can provide certain advantages, such as facilitating collaboration among Members and providing leadership opportunities outside of one's party or committee assignments. At times, this relative independence has also led to concerns over oversight for informal organizations, as well as concerns over the fractionalization of the legislative process and competition with formal leadership and committee functions.
The leaders of the eight legislative branch agencies and entities—the Government Accountability Office, the Library of Congress, the Government Publishing Office (formerly Government Printing Office), the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Congressional Research Service (CRS), and the Congressional Office of Compliance—are appointed in a variety of manners. The first four agencies are led by a person appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The next two are appointed by Congress and the next by the Librarian of Congress. The last is appointed by a board of directors. Congress has periodically examined the procedures used to appoint legislative branch officers with the aim of protecting the prerogatives of, and ensuring accountability to, Congress within the framework of the advice-and-consent appointment process established in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. Questions remain about various reform proposals, including the ability of Congress to remove the President from the appointment process for some of these positions. In the 111th Congress, two measures (H.R. 2185 and H.R%. 2843) were introduced to remove President Obama from the Architect appointment process and shift it to congressional leaders and chairs and ranking Members of specific congressional committees. Under both measures, the Architect would still serve a 10-year term. This bill was reported by the Committee on House Administration and referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, but no further action was taken on it. The House and Senate also considered legislation in the 115th Congress that would have altered the appointment of one position within one of these agencies—the Register of Copyrights. The Register is currently led by Acting Register Karyn A. Temple, who was named to the position on October 21, 2016. On February 24, 2016, the Capitol Police Board announced that Matthew R. Verderosa would be appointed as the new Chief of the United States Capitol Police. Previously, Chief Kim Dine was sworn in on December 17, 2012. The director of the CBO has been appointed wholly by Congress since the creation of the post with the passage of the congressional budget act in 1974. The Director of CBO is appointed "by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of theSenate after considering recommendations received from the Committees on the Budget of theHouse and the Senate, without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of his fitness to perform his duties." The director may be reappointed, and either chamber can remove the director by simple resolution. Additionally, a director appointed "to fill a vacancy prior to the expiration of a term shall serve only for the unexpired portion of that term" and an "individual serving as Director at the expirationof a term may continue to serve until his successor is appointed." The Director receives compensation at an annual rate that is equal to the lower of the highest annual rate of compensation of any officer of the house or Senate.
Many Members of Congress became actively engaged in foreign policy debates over U.S. intervention in the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (hereafter, "Bosnia"). Congress monitored and at times challenged the Bush and Clinton Administrations' response to the conflict through numerous hearings, resolutions, and legislative initiatives. Many observers contend that the United States is a stakeholder in Bosnia's future because of the strong impact of U.N. intervention on the postwar Bosnian state. Nearly 25 years after warring parties in Bosnia reached the Dayton Agreement (see below), Bosnia faces numerous internal and external challenges, and the country retains geopolitical importance to U. S. interests in the Western Balkans. As Congress assesses ongoing and emerging security issues in the region, including resilience against malign external influence, renewed conflict, and radicalization, Bosnia's internal politics and its role in Balkan stability may merit further examination. Bosnia's political system is a product of the Dayton Peace Agreement, which divided Bosnia into two ethnoterritorial entities: Republika Srpska (RS), where Serbs are the largest ethnic group (82%), and the Federation (FBiH), where Bosniaks (70%) and Croats (22%). The two entities have broader policy jurisdiction than the central state-level government, which is largely composed of Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaders. The Dayton Agreement also established a strong oversight role for the international community. The Office of the High Representative (OHR) was created to monitor the implementation of civilian aspects of the peace agreement. The OHR is supported by the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), a group of 55 countries and agencies. Many analysts believe that the Dayton agreement helped hold Bosnia together after the war; they point to the absence of widespread violence since 1995 as an indicator of its success. However, observers also question whether Bosnia can function much longer under the Dayton system. They identify several key challenges: (1) Ethnic divisions. Critics claim that the political system reinforces the country's ethnic divisions and makes ethnicity a core basis of political identity. The ethnic parties that have dominated politics since the war generally appeal to voters from their respective ethnic communities rather than all Bosnians. Critics accuse ethnic party leaders of inflaming nationalist tensions and manipulating historical memory to distract from corruption and win elections, thus aggravating rather than bridging the deep wounds that remain from the war. (2) Gridlock. Some analysts also contend that Bosnia's fractured, overlapping institutions sometimes muddle policymaking jurisdiction and impede coordinated response. Furthermore, power-sharing arrangements create numerous veto points in the legislative process. Government coalitions are typically ideologically broad and unwieldy, creating a further source of potential dysfunction. One of the consequences of these barriers is that it is difficult to pass legislation. (3) Lack of consensus. While many officials recognize that Bosnia needs reform, there is little consensus on how to change it or to generate the political will to find common ground so long as the dominant parties remain entrenched. Milorad Dodik, who has dominated politics in RS since the mid-2000s, has repeatedly threatened RS secession and has called for more autonomy for Croats. Bosniak leaders generally prefer more centralization and the removal of some of the institutional arrangements that they believe contribute to dysfunction and gridlock. Despite broad voter dissatisfaction, entrenched ethnic parties won the largest vote shares in the October 7, 2018 general election. Some observers believe that periods of social discontent in 2014 and 2018, which challenged the system but appeared to transcend ethnic divides, suggest that strengthening Bosnian civil society could increase pressure for reform, and perhaps cultivate a new generation of party leaders. Other observers have put their hopes for reform on Bosnia's so-called "civic parties," which do not have nationalist platforms and typically mobilize voters on the basis of socioeconomic interests rather than ethnicity. While these parties have not matched the results of the ethnic parties, their electoral performance has improved in recent years. Bosnia is one of Europe's poorest countries. GDP per capita was $5,148 in 2017, well below the EU average ($33,715) and that of Bulgaria ($8,031), its lowest-ranking member. Nearly one in five Bosnian households lives below the poverty level. The country's unemployment rate was 18% in 2018, down from 28%.
Economic growth and expanded global trade have led to substantial increases in goods movement over the past few decades. The growth in freight transportation demand, along with growing passenger demand, has caused congestion in parts of the transportation system, making freight movements slower and less reliable. Federal support of freight infrastructure investment is likely to be of significant congressional concern in the reauthorization of the surface transportation program. The program is currently authorized by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94), which is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020. Congress has begun to place greater emphasis on freight over the course of recent reauthorizations, but national policy is still vague or silent on a number of issues. There are ongoing disagreements about the best way to accomplish improvements in freight system infrastructure—notably, how to raise new funds for investment, the magnitude of the amounts required, which projects to prioritize, and the role of the federal government in the planning process. Meanwhile, technological advances in mobility have prompted new questions about how best to accomplish the efficient movement of people and goods in a multimodal transportation system. Autonomous vehicle technology could have potential applications in the trucking industry, as could greater deployment of automation in the rail and port industries. While the FAST Act concerns many aspects of surface transportation funding and safety policy, the focus of this report is on truck freight and that portion of the rail or port industries that transports truck trailers and containers (intermodal freight). The freight transportation system is a complex network of different types of transportation, known as modes, that carries everything from coal to small packages. It handles domestic shipments of a few miles as well as international shipments of thousands of miles. Often, a shipment of cargo will move across multiple modes before reaching its destination, using road, rail, air, pipeline, and/or maritime infrastructure in the process. Freight moved in stackable containers is easier to move among ships, trains, and trucks; this is referred to as intermodalfreight. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) forecasts that freight tonnage will increase by an average of about 1.4% per year from 2015 to 2045, which would represent an acceleration compared to recent trends. The federal government supports surface transportation projects mostly through funds distributed to the states. Financing initiatives, on the other hand, are arrangements that rely primarily on borrowing. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) supports freight infrastructure financing arrangements mainly through direct loans, loan guarantees, and tax preferences for certain types of bonds. The FAST act created a new Surface Transportation Infrastructure Finance Bureau to consolidate some of the support functions for several of these programs. It also directed a portion of federal funds toward highway segments and other projects deemed most critical to freight movement. It did this by creating a new discretionary grant program and a new formula program for distributing federal funds to states. The stated goals of these two programs are very similar: to increase U. S. global economic competitiveness, reduce congestion and bottlenecks, increase the efficiency and reliability of the highway network, and reduce the environmental impact of freight movement, among other goals. Congress may also be asked to consider other freight-related issues, such as whether there should be a dedicated revenue stream for freight infrastructure and whether additional federal funding should be dedicated to freight projects selected by DOT rather than distributed by formula for spending at the discretion of states.
Charging fees for grazing private livestock on federal lands is statutorily authorized and has been the policy of the Forest Service (FS, Department of Agriculture) since 1906, and of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) since 1936. Today, fees are charged for grazing on BLM and FS land basically under a fee formula established in the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 (PRIA) and continued administratively. The fee is based on the grazing on federal rangelands of a specified number of animals for one month. PRIA establishes a policy of charging a grazing fee that is "equitable" and prevents economic disruption and harm to the western livestock industry. The law requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to set a fee annually that is the estimated economic value of grazing to the livestock owner. This value is adjusted for three factors based on costs in western states of (1) the rental charge for pasturing cattle on private rangeland, (2) the sales price of beef cattle, and (3) the cost of livestock production. Congress also established that the annual fee adjustment could not exceed 25% of the previous year's fee. Fifty percent of grazing fees collected by each agency, or $10.0 million—whichever is greater—go to a range betterment fund in the U.S. Treasury. The agencies use the fund for range rehabilitation, protection, and improvement, including grass seeding and reseeding, fence construction, weed control, water development, and fish and wildlife habitat. The remaining 50% is to be used in the district, region, or forest that generated the fees, as the Secretary of the Interior determines after consultation with user representatives. In recent years, there have been proposals to alter the grazing fee, but these proposals have not been adopted. For example, the Obama Administration's proposed grazing administration fee of $2.50 per animal unit (AUM) in 2017 would have shifted a portion of the costs to permit holders, subject to appropriations. BLM estimated that the proposed administrative fee would have generated $16.5 million in FY2017. Livestock organizations, among others, opposed the proposal as an unnecessary and burdensome cost for the livestock industry, and the Administration had included similar proposals in earlier budget requests; none of these proposals were enacted. There is ongoing debate about the appropriate grazing fee. There are differences over which criteria should prevail in setting fees: fair market value; cost recovery (whereby the monies collected would cover the government's cost of running the program); sustaining ranching, or resource-based rural economies generally; or diversification of local economies. Some argue that the fee is not the main issue, but that all livestock grazing should be barred to protect federal lands. Others assert that federal fees are not comparable to fees for leasing private lands because public lands often are less productive; must be shared with other public users; and often lack water, fencing, or other amenities, thereby increasing operating costs. They fear that fee increases may force many small and medium-sized ranchers out of business. Conservation groups generally assert that low fees contribute to overgrazing and deteriorated range conditions. Critics assert that lower federal fees subsidize ranchers and contribute to budget shortfalls because federal fees do not cover the costs of range management. They further contend that, because some of the collected fees are used for range improvements, higher fees could enhance the productive potential and environmental quality of federal land.
The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP), administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF), provides services to runaway and homeless youth through three programs: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). Under the RHYP, the BCP is intended to provide short-term shelter and services for youth and their families at centers operated by BCP grantees, which are public and private community-based organizations. The TLP provides longer-term services to youth ages 16 through 22 (or older if the youth entered the TLP prior to reaching age 22) who may leave their biological homes due to family conflict, or have left and are not expected to return home. The SOP is a separately funded program that provides services for homeless and runaway youth who have been subjected to sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, prostitution, or trafficking. The RHYPs are administered by HHS's Family and youth Services Bureau and funded through annual appropriations. In FY2017, the program served 23,288 youth, and in FY2018 it funded 280 BCP shelters (most recent figures available). These centers, which can shelter as many as 20 youth, are generally supposed to be located in areas that are frequented or easily reached by runaway or homeless youth. BCP grants are allocated directly to grantees for a three-year period. Funding is generally distributed to entities based on the proportion of the nation's youth under age 18 in the jurisdiction where the entities are located. The 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico each receive a minimum allotment of $200,000. Separately, the territories (currently, this includes American Samoa and Guam) each receives a minimum of $70,000, and the amount of funding for each state or territory can further depend on whether grant applicants in that jurisdiction applied for funding, and if so, whether the applicant fulfilled the requirements in the authorizing law and grant application. The costs of the B CP are shared by the federal government (90%) and grantees (10%). In FY2018, Congress appropriated $1.2 billion for the program, which is administered by FYSB. In addition, Congress has provided additional funding for the RYP through the following omnibus appropriations laws: P.L. 110-378 (for FY2017), P. L. 111-139 (forFY2018), P (P.L.) 111-171 ( for FY2019), and P (L) 111-254 (for the FY2020 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, FY2021). The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 (Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act) was enacted in 1974 to assist runaways through services specifically for this population. Since that time, the law has been updated to authorize services to provide support for runaways outside of the juvenile justice, mental health, and child welfare systems. The act authorized federal funding to be provided through appropriations for three programs that assist these youth: BCP, TLP, and SOP. Under the law, 90% of the federal funds appropriated under the two programs must be used for BCP and TLP (together, the programs and their related activities are known as the Consolidated Runaway & Homeless Youth program). The remaining share of consolidated funding is allocated for (1) a national communication system to facilitate communication between service providers, runaway youth,and their families (National Safeline); (2) training and technical support for grantees; (3) evaluations of the programs; (4) federal coordination efforts on matters relating to the health, education, employment, and housing of these youth; and (5) studies of runaway and homelessness youth. In recent years, other federal entities have also been involved in responding to the challenges facing these youth. These efforts are coordinated through the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). The USICH, established under the 1987 Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, is made up of several federal agencies, including HHS and HUD. The HEARTH Act, enacted in 2009, charged USICH with developing a National Strategic Plan to End Homelessness. In June 2010, USICH released this plan, entitled Opening Doors. The plan set out
The issue of executive discretion has been at the center of constitutional debates in liberal democracies throughout the twentieth century. How to balance a commitment to the rule of law with the exigencies of modern political and economic crises has engaged legislators and scholars in the United States and around the world. The United States Constitution is silent on questions of emergency power. As such, over the past two centuries, Congress and the President have answered those questions in varied and often ad hoc ways. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the answer was often for the President to act without congressional approval in a time of crisis, knowingly risking impeachment and personal civil liability. Congress claimed primacy over emergency action and would decide subsequently to either ratify the President's actions or indemnify him for any civil liability, but by the early twentieth century, a new pattern had begun to emerge. Instead of retroactively judging an executive's extraordinary actions in a state of emergency, Congress created statutory bases permitting the president to make use of extraordinary delegated powers. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is one such example of a twentieth-century delegation of emergency authority. One of 123 emergency statutes under the umbrella of the National Emergencies Act (NEA), IEEPA grants the President extensive power to regulate a variety of economic transactions during an emergency. The scope of presidential emergency authority has expanded in scale, scope, and frequency since the statute's enactment. Since 1977, Presidents have invoked I EEPA in 54 declarations of national emergency. On average, these emergencies have lasted nearly a decade. Most emergencies have been geographically specific, targeting a specific country or government. However, since 1990, Presidents has declared non-geographically-specific emergencies in response to issues like weapons proliferation, global terrorism, and malicious cyber-enabled activities. The erosion of geographic limitations has been accompanied by an expansion in the nature of the targets of sanctions issued under IeePA authority. Originally, IEE PA was used to target foreign governments; however, Presidents are increasingly targeting groups and individuals. While Presidents usually makeuse of IEEPSA as an emergency power, Congress has also directed the use of the statute or expressed its approval of its use in several statutes. The Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-246, H.R. 3590) is the most recent example of congressional approval of presidential use of emergency powers under the NEA. In addition to authorizing or directing the President for use in the context of national emergencies, Congress also authorizes or directs the President, retroactively, to use the Act to impose sanctions outside of the national emergency context. In recent years, Presidents, however, have invoked the Act in order to preempt or modify parallel congressional activity, including the imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on trade. This report provides a brief overview of the scope and use of executive emergency economic powers and examines the issues Congress may wish to address with respect to how Congress has delegated its authority to the President under IEEpa and its umbrella statute.
The Small Business Act of 1953 (P.L. 83-163, as amended) authorized the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and justified the agency's existence on the grounds that small businesses are essential to the maintenance of the free enterprise system. In economic terms, the congressional intent was to assist small businesses as a means to deter monopoly and oligarchy formation within all industries and the market failures caused by the elimination or reduction of competition in the marketplace. Congress decided to allow the SBA to establish size standards to ensure that only small businesses were provided SBA assistance. The SBA's size standards are based on four measures: (1) number of employees, (2) average annual receipts in the previous three (may soon be five) years, (3) average asset size as reported in the firm's four quarterly financial statements for the preceding year, (4) a combination of employees and barrel per day refining capacity (1 industry), and (5) average net income after federal taxes. In the absence of precise statutory guidance and consensus on how to define small, the size standards have often been challenged, typically by industry representatives seeking to increase the number of firms eligible for assistance and by Members of Congress concerned that the standards may not adequately target federal assistance to firms that they consider to be truly small. This report provides a historical examination of the SSA's size standard methodology and assesses competing views concerning how to defines a small business. It also discusses legislation introduced during the 112th Congress (H.R. 585, the Small Business Size Standard Flexibility Act of 2011), 113th Congress, 114th and 115th Congresses, and the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The report concludes with a discussion of some of the policy options Congress may choose to address as part of its oversight of SBA size standards. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, P. l. 111-240, established an interim alternative size standard for the 7(a) and 504/Certified Development Company (504/CDC) loan guaranty programs of not more than $15 million in tangible net worth and $5 million in averageNet Income after Federal Taxes for the two full fiscal years before the date of the application for both programs for firms applying for loans approved from May 5, 2009, through September 30, 2010. P.l. 112-239, the National Defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013, directed the SBI to assign the appropriate size standard to each NAICS industrial classification and not to limit the number or combine size standards for any given industrial classification. The 114th Congress passed legislation in the 114th, 115th, and 2017 Congresses to authorize the SIA's Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy to approve or disapprove a size standard requested by a federal agency for purposes other than the Small business Act or Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The Office of Advocacy is an independent SBA office that represents the interests of small businesses in rulemaking proceedings, including the approval or disapproval of proposed and final rulemaking by federal agencies. Legislation introduced in the 115th and 2016 Congresses includes H.J.Res. 2542, the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2013, and included in the Jobs for America Act; H. R. 527, the small business regulatory Flexibility improvements Act of 2015, and its Senate companion bill, S. 1536; and S. 584, the regulatory flexibility improvements bill included in H.R., 584 and H.r. 5.
On November 9, 1916, Jeannette Rankin (R-MT) was elected to the House of Representatives as Montana's Representative-at-Large to the 65th Congress (1917-1919). This election win gave Representative Rankin the dist inction of being the first woman elected to serve in Congress. Three hundred sixty five women have been elected or appointed to Congress. These figures include six nonvoting Delegates, one each from Guam, Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and American Samoa, and two from the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as one Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico. Of these 365 women, there have been 247 Democrats and 118 Republicans; 309 (211 Democrats, 98 Republicans) women elected only in the House, including 7 (4 Democrats, 3 Republicans) woman who have served as Delegates or Resident Commissioners; 40 (25 Democrats, 15 Republicans) female Senators elected only to the Senate; and 16 (11 Democrats, 5 Republicans) females elected to both houses. A record 131 women currently serve in the 116th Congress. This is higher than the previous record from the 115th Congress, which had 109 women initially sworn in, 5 House Members subsequently elected, and 2 Senators subsequently appointed. Not including Delegates and the Resident Commissioner, women currently hold a record 127 (23.7%) of the 535 voting seats in the entire Congress, including 106 (24.2%) House seats and 25 (25%) Senate seats. This report includes brief biographical information, committee assignments, dates of service, listings by Congress and state, and (for Representatives) congressional districts of the 365 women. It will be updated when there are relevant changes in the makeup of Congress. Most of the data presented are from the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-present, available at http://bioguide.congress.gov; various editions of the Congressional Directory; Congressional Quarterly and Leadership Directories Inc. publications; and the Women in Congress website, athttp://womenincognito.house.gov.

Firefighting and the provision of fire protection services to the public is traditionally a local responsibility, funded primarily by state, county, and municipal governments. During the 1990s, however, shortfalls in state and local budgets—coupled with increased responsibilities (i.e., counterterrorism) of local fire departments—led many in the fire community to call for additional financial support from the federal government. In response, in the 107th and 108th Congresses, the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Act (commonly referred to as the "SAFER Act) was introduced. The SAFER Act authorizes grants to career, volunteer, and combination fire departments for the purpose of increasing the number of firefighters to help communities meet industry-minimum standards and attain 24-hour staffing to provide adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards. Two types of grants are authorized by the SAFer Act: hiring grants and recruitment and retention grants. The Fire Grants Reauthorization Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-239, Title XVIII, Subtitle A) significantly amended the SAFER statute (15 U.S.C. 2229a) and authorized the program through FY2017. The Administration's FY2017 budget requested $335 million for SAFER and $340 million for AFG, a reduction of $10 million for each program from the FY2016 enacted level. On May 26, 2016, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 3001, the Department of Homeland Security Act, 2017 (S.Rept. 114-68). The Senate bill would provide $680 million for firefighter assistance in FY2017, including $350 million for the Firefighter Assistance Grants (AFG) program. On July 18, 2017, the House Committee on Appropriations approved its version of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3355). The House bill would have provided $690 million in firefighter assistance for FY2018. On September 14, 2018, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2019, which provided $688.688 million in FY2019. On June 21, 2019, S. 3109, the DHS Appropriations bill, was approved by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The Senate version of this bill provided $700 million in funding for firefighter aid in FY2020. The President's FY2020 budget proposal does not request SAFER waiver authority. The House and Senate versions of the FY2019 Homeland Security appropriations bills did not include SAFER waivers for FY2020, but the Senate bill did include SAFer waiver authority for FY2021. On December 15, 2017 the Senate passed S. 829, the United States Fire Administration, AFG and SAFER program reauthorization act of 2017, by unanimous consent. On March 4, 2018 the House passed the House-passed version of S. 4661, the Firefighters' Assistance, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Act of 2018, which reauthorized the AFG program through September 30, 2024. On January 3, 2018 The President signed the United states fire administration, AFg, and SAFer program reauthorized through FY2023 in the UnitedStates Fire Administration (USFA) Reauthorizations Act of 2017 (P,L. 115-98). The Consolidated appropriations act, FY2019 (P.,L. 116-6) provided $726.6 million in fire assistance for firefighters in FY2018 and $723.5 million in AFG in FY19. The FY2019 appropriations bill included $722.5 billion in firefighter aid, including a $344.4 million SAFER appropriation and $344 million AFG appropriation.
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under which the federal government gives annual grants to states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and commonwealths, and Indian tribal organizations to operate multi-component home energy assistance programs for needy households. Established in 1981 by Title XXVI of P.L. 97-35, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, LIHEAP has been reauthorized and amended a number of times, most recently in 2005, when Congress authorized $5.1 billion per year in regular funds for the program from FY2005 through FY2007. The LIHEap statute provides for two types of program funding: regular funds—sometimes referred to as block grant funds—and emergency contingency funds. Regular funds are allotted to states on the basis of a statutory formula, which was enacted as part of the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1984. The way in which regular funds are allocated to states depends on the amount of funds appropriated by Congress. Emergency contingency funds, last appropriated in FY2011, may be released and allotted to one or more states at the discretion of the President and the Secretary of HHS to meet additional energy assistance needs created by a natural disaster or other emergency. Funds for tribes are included in each state's formula allocations and are distributed at the state level based on eligible tribal members. Territories receive funds separately as a percentage set aside of regular funds, so neither tribes nor territories is included in the formula discussion. For more information on LIHE AP more generally, see CRS Report RL31865, LI HEAP: Program and Funding, by Libby Perl. The remainder of this report discusses only the history and methods of distributing regular LIHEAAP funds to the states. This report will be updated as warranted by legislative events. For a more detailed discussion of LI HEAAP, see the following CRS reports: CRS In Focus IF10101, Low-Income Energy Assistance for Families with Dependent Children, by [author name scrubbed], and CRS Reports RL31864, Low Income Energy Assistance: Overview of Federal Programs, Programs, and Funding (by [author names scrubbed] and [authorname scrubbed]. For a discussion of the Emergency Supplemental Security Income (SSI) formula for low-income families, see The Low Income Supplemental Energy Allowances Program: formula for SSI. For information on the SSI formula for families with incomes below 125% of poverty (as defined by the federal poverty guidelines), see CRC Report RL32048, Low income families: how SSI funds are distributed, and how states are held harmless under the current formula.
The Historically Underutilized Business Zone Empowerment Contracting (HUBZone) program provides participating small businesses located in areas with low income, high poverty, or high levels of unemployment with contracting opportunities in the form of set-asides, sole-source awards, and price-evaluation preferences. In FY2017, the federal government awarded 81,082 contracts valued at $7.53 billion to HUBZone-certified businesses. About $1.90 billion of that amount was awarded with a HUB zone preference ($1.49 billion through a HubZone set- aside, $65.3 million through aHUB zone sole- source award, and $346.9 million through an HUBzone price- evaluation preference). In addition, the Small Business Administration (SBA) awarded $4.10 billion in additional small business awards in FY2017. The program's administrative cost is about $9.8 million annually. It received an appropriation of $3 million for FY2019, with the additional cost of administering the program provided by the SBA's appropriation for salaries and general administrative expenses. Congressional interest in the program has increased in recent years, primarily due to U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports of program fraud and efforts by small businesses to ease program eligibility requirements. During the 115th Congress, P.L. 115-91, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, included provisions from several bills introduced during the 115 th Congress, including S. 929, the Invest in Rural Small Business Act of 2017, and H.R. 3294, the HUBZones Unification and Business Stability Act of2017, that would have extended the program's eligibility for small businesses in eligible areas from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The act also included provisions to extend eligibility for qualified disaster areas and to provide for the creation of redesignated areas for census tracts and nonmetropolitan counties that lose HUB Zone eligibility due to changes in economic data. P. l. 114-92, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (BRAC) Act of 2005, also included a provision to expand BRAC area eligibility for HUB zones to include areas that are contiguous to a BRAC base closure area. In the 114 th Congress (H.R., H.J.Res. 6, S. 3175, and S. 1859), the House and Senate also passed bills to increase the federal federal government's small business contracting goals. The federal government has established contracting goals for small business generally (at least 23% of the total value of all small business eligible prime contract awards for each fiscal year), small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, small business located within a HBOZone, and service-disabled veteran- owned small businesses. These goals have not been met in most fiscal years since 2005, although the 5% contracting goal for small disadvantaged small businesses has been achieved in each of the last five fiscal years (5.5% in FY2015, 5.0% in 2016, and 5.1% in 2017). During the 113th Congress (S. 259, the Assuring Contracting Equity Act of 2013), S. 259 would have increased these contracting goals to 25%, 10%, and 3%. The bill's provisions were reintroduced in both the 114th and 115thCongresses. In May 2014, the House passed the Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense authorization bill, which would have also increased the goals for disadvantaged businesses and women-own small businesses from 5% to 10%. The Senate's national defense reauthorization bill did not include this language. Also, the Minority Small Business Enhancement Act of 2015, H.r. 273, the minority small business bill, would have established a 40% subcontracting goal for all small businesses generally. The Obama Administration opposed the House's provisions.
The United States Fire Administration (USFA) is currently an entity within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Its mission is to provide leadership, coordination, and support for the nation's fire prevention and control, fire training and education, and emergency medical services activities, and to prepare first responders and health care leaders to react to hazard and terrorism emergencies of all kinds. The USFA receives its annual appropriation through the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security. Since FY2004, the USFA has been funded through the Preparedness, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery (PMRR) account within the Emergency Preparingness and Response Directorate of the DHS. On July 13, 2005, then-DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff announced a restructuring of DHS, effective October 1, 2005. USFA was removed from the PMRR account and received a separate appropriation (its own line item) under the new DHS Directorate for Prep preparedness. The FY2007 DHS appropriations bill (P.L. 109-295) transferred USFA back to the FEMA within DHS. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed $42.3 million for USFA, a 3.8% decrease from the FY2016 level. The request included $1.5 million for facilities improvement under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 3109, the DHS Appropriations Act, 2019 (S.Rept. 115-283). The Senate bill would provide $44 million to USFA in the Federal Assistance account, $507,000 above the budget request, to ensure the National Fire Academy can fulfill its mission of providing training and professional development without reducing its ability to carry out other important responsibilities. The bill report directed FEMA to continue its traditional funding for the congressionally mandated National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. S.3109 would also provide $1 million for annual capital improvement of the National Emergency Training Center. The House Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2019 Homeland Security Appropriations Act (H.R. 3354) on July 25, 2018. It would provide a total of $44.41 million in federal assistance for US FA. On December 18, 2017, the House passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2018 (H.-R. 3355). The bill provided the same level as the Administration request: $41.913 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the federal assistance account, and $ 1.497 million under the procurement, construction, and improvements account. The Senate passed the bill on December 21, 2017. On January 3, 2018 the President signed the United States fire Administration, Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (H-R. 4661) into law, which reauthorized USFA through FY2023.

The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is one of the most-tracked single accounts funded by Congress each year. Managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), it is the primary source of funding for the federal government's domestic general disaster relief programs. These programs, authorized under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq. ), outline the federal role in supporting state, local, tribal, and territorial governments as they respond to and recover from a variety of incidents. They take effect in the event that nonfederal levels of government find their own capacity to deal with an incident is overwhelmed. The current emergency management policy environment assumes this federal roles in domestic disaster relief as the default position and the availability of resources through the DRF a necessary requirement. However, this was not always the case. Prior to the development of these programs, disaster relief and recovery was a matter for private nongovernmental organizations and state and local governments. Federal involvement in relief after natural and man-made disasters was very rare before the Civil War, and was at times considered unconstitutional. Domestic disaster relief efforts became more common after the civil war, but were not seen as a necessary obligation of the federalgovernment. Standing federal domestic disaster Relief programs and a pool of resources to fund them only emerged after the Second World War. Once established, they grew, proving politically popular and resilient despite periodic concerns about management, execution, and budgetary impacts. The DRF is an indicator of the scope of those programs and the volume of taxpayer-funded aid they provide. Understanding the trends in the growth of the government's role in disaster response and recovery, and the associated costs of that role, may be useful as Congress considers changes in both emergency management and budgetary policies. This report provides an overview of how the federal disaster relief program has evolved over time. It also provides a brief history of the disaster relief fund and its funding history, and discusses several issues before Congress connected to the fund and the programs it supports. The report concludes with a discussion of some of the issues Congress may wish to consider as it considers the future direction of the program, including the appropriate level of disaster relief funding, how the funds are being spent, and what accommodations should be made in the federal budget for disaster relief. It will be updated as warranted by major disasters, emergencies, and other events.

On July 24, 2018, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would be taking several temporary actions to assist farmers in response to trade damage from what the Administration has characterized as "unjustified retaliation." Specifically, USDA would authorize up to $12 billion in financial assistance—referred to as the "trade aid" package—for certain agricultural commodities under Section 5 of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act. The Secretary said that most of the funding would go to agricultural commodities most directly affected by the trade retaliation—corn, cotton, soybeans, sorghum, wheat, hogs, and dairy (sweet cherries and almonds were added to this list in September)—but that some funding would also be used for the purchase, distribution, and trade promotion of a variety of affected commodities. The trade-aid package includes a Market Facilitation Program (MFP) of direct payments to affected producers, a Food Purchase and Distribution Program, and an Agricultural Trade Promotion (ATP) program. Payments under the MFP program would be made in two rounds: a first round announced on August 27,2018, initially valued at $4.7 billion; and an equivalent-valued secondround announced on December 17, 2018. The MFP payments are tied directly to a producer's actual level of production of eligible commodities in 2018. A producer's total potential MFP payment for an eligible commodity equals the announced payment rate per unit (see column two of Table 1) times the harvested (and certified) production during 2018 or in the case of hogs or fresh sweet cherries, the inventory during the period of July 15 to August 15,2018. During the first payment period (announced by USDA on September 27), MFP payouts were set equal to the announced MFP rate times 50% of the producer's harvested and certified production. The second payment rate (announced on December17) applied to the remaining 50%. USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) is to administer the M FP by providing payments in two potential tranches. Under the sign-up period, producers can submit MFP applications beginning on the following dates: September 4, 2018; and September 24, 2019. Initially, producers were given a deadline of January 15, 2019, to complete an application. However, USDA extended the deadline to February 14 due to a partial shutdown of the federal government. The current deadline for producers to certify their 2018 production is May 1,2019. As of February 7, USDA has made $6.4 billion in payments to farmers under the first round of MFP. USDA has also announced that it will make $1.2 billion in purchases of food commodities under the second round. The Administration's announcement does not specify whether the CCC or Section 32 authority is being used to make the purchases, but the scale of the program indicates that it is most likely the source since the typical annual amount of funding available in Section 32 for purchases is rarely more than half of this amount. In addition, the Administration's purchases appear to use distribution channels similar to those under Section 32. While soybean growers and most farm-advocacy groups have generally been supportive of the payments, some commodity groups—most notably associations representing corn, wheat and milk—contend that the payments are insufficient to fully compensate their industries. The National Corn Growers Association claims that recent trade disputes have lowered corn prices by $0.44/bu. for a loss of $5.3 billion on the projected 2018 harvest. Similarly, the National Association of Wheat Growers estimates that a decrease of nearly $2.5 billion in wheat prices will result in lost value, while the National Milk Producers Federation calculates that milk prices are now estimated to be $ 1.10/cwt. lower than just prior to the trade retaliatory tariffs.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to enhance small business access to capital; programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loans for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and access to entrepreneurial education to assist with business formation and expansion. It also administers the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program. The SBIC program is designed to "improve and stimulate the national economy in general and the small-business segment thereof in particular" by stimulating and supplementing "the flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small- business concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization, and which are not available in adequate supply." The SBA partners with privately owned and managed SBICs licensed by the SBA to provide financing to small businesses with private capital the SBIC has raised (called regulatory capital) and with funds (called leverage) the SB IC borrows at favorable rates because the SBCA guarantees the debenture (loan obligation). The program's primary objective was, and remains, to facilitate the flow of capital to small business to stimulate the nation's economy. In recent years, some Members of Congress have argued that the program should be expanded as a means to stimulate economic activity and create jobs. For example, P.L. 113-76, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, increased the annual amount of leverage authorized to be provided to SB ICs to $4 billion from $3 billion, and the amount of outstanding leverage allowed for two or more SBIC licenses under common control (the multiple licenses/family of funds limit) to $350 million from $225 million. During the 113th Congress, S. 511, the Expanding Access to Capital for Entrepreneurial Leaders Act (EXCEL Act), would have also increased the program's multiple license/family-of-funds limit to $300 million. In addition, H.R. 30 and S. 1285 would have authorized the Administration to establish a separate program for startup and early stage small businesses. The Small Business Innovation Act (of 2016) was reintroduced (S. 3375) during the 114th Congress. The act would have created a separate SBIC initiative to encourage SBIC investments in early-stage small businesses (defined as small businesses that have never achieved positive cash flow from operations in any fiscal year). The Obama Administration also established a five-year, $1 billion early stage SBIC Initiative in 2012. The initiative was intended to increase the number of early stage businesses participating in the program. In 2017, the program stopped accepting new applications for the early stage initiative, and on June 11, 2018, theSBA withdrew a proposed rule to make the initiative a permanent part of the program, stating that the costs were not commensurate with the results and that the comments to the proposed rule did not demonstrate broad support for a permanent early stage program. This report will be updated as events warrant.
The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the Budget Act) created the budget resolution and specifies that it be adopted annually. The budget resolution reflects an agreement between the House and Senate on spending and revenue levels. Once agreed to by both chambers in the exact same form, it creates parameters that may be enforced in two primary ways: (1) by points of order, and (2) by using the budget reconciliation process. This means that if legislation is being considered on the House or Senate floor that would violate certain levels contained in the budget resolutions, a Member may raise a point of order against the consideration of that legislation. Points of order can be raised against bills, resolutions, amendments, or conference reports. In addition, either chamber may waive the point of Order. The process for waiving points of Order, and the number of Members required to waive points ofOrder, varies by chamber. Generally, such points oforder can be waived in the House by a simple majority of Members and in the Senate by three-fifths of all Senators. In the absence of a budget resolution, other budget enforcement mechanisms are available to Congress comprising two general categories. First, there are types of budget enforcement that are entirely separate from the budget Resolution, such as chamber rules and statutory spending caps. These mechanisms remain in effect and place restrictions on certain types of budgetary legislation. Second, Congress may employ alternative legislative tools to serve as a substitute for a budget Resolution. When Congress has been late in reaching final agreement, or has not reached agreement at all, it has relied on such substitutes as "deeming resolutions," which are deemed to serve in place of an agreement on an annual budget resolution for the purposes of establishing enforceable budget levels for the upcoming fiscal year (or multiple fiscal years). Deeming resolutions are not formally defined and have no specifically prescribed content. Instead, they denote Congress, often separately, engaging legislative procedures to deal with enforcement issues on an ad hoc basis. The House and the Senate have often agreed to deeming resolutions several months after they have separately agreed to budget resolutions but have not come to agreement with each other. For example, the House agreed to a deeming resolution for FY2014 in June but in December passed the Bipartisan Budget Act (P.L. 114-74, enacted in November of 2015) that superseded parts of the initial deemingresolution. This report answers frequently asked questions about the budget process, including the following questions: What is the Budget Resolution and how is it enforced? What types of enforcement exist outside of the budgetresolution? What are the types of legislative tools that can be used to enforce the budgetary levels in the Budget resolution? In which years did Congress rely on deemingResolutions in the Absence of Agreement on a Budget Resolution? In what ways have Deeming Resolutions Varied? This report will be updated as events warrant.
Successive Administrations have identified Iran as a key national security challenge. The Trump Administration encapsulated its assessment of the threat posed by Iran in a late September 2018 State Department report entitled "Outlaw Regime: A Chronicle of Iran's Destructive Activities." It outlines Iran's malign activities as well as a litany of other activities the Administration terms "the Iranian regime's destructive behavior at home and abroad." Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i, Iran's paramount decisionmaker since 1989, has repeatedly stated that the United States seeks to overturn Iran's regime through support for anti-regime activists, economic sanctions, and alliances with Iran's regional adversaries. Iran's foreign and defense policies are products of overlapping, and sometimes contradictory, motivations. They are apparently motivated, at least to some extent, by the perception of threats to their regime and their national interests posed by the U.S. and its allies. Iran claims that the political and economic structures of the Middle East are heavily weighted against who Iranian leaders describe as "oppressed peoples": the Palestinians, who do not have an independent state, and Shia Muslims, who are politically underrepresented and economically disadvantaged minorities in many countries of the region. Iranian leaders assert that the region's politics and economics have been distorted by Western intervention and economic domination and that the creation of Israel is a manifestation of Western intervention that deprived the Palestinians of legitimate rights. They claim a right to be recognized as a major power in the region and assert that their foreign policy is intended, at at least in part, to ensure that theUnited States cannot interfere in Iran's domestic affairs. They cite as evidence of past U. S. interference the 1953 U.N.-backed overthrow of elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq and the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, which resulted in U.L. backing for Saddam Hussein's regime. They also assert that U.R. support for Sunni Arab regimes that oppose Iran has led to the empowerment of radical Sunni Islamist groups and spawned Sunni-dominated terrorist groups such as the Islamic State. The United States has long been concerned about Iran's intentions and has sought to dissuade Iran from developing a nuclear weapons program. In 2015, the Obama Administration negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which Iran agreed to limits on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The JCPOA was signed into law in July 2015, but the Trump Administration has withdrawn from the agreement on May 8, 2018, citing the agreement's failure to address its concerns about Iranian "malign activities" and the expiration of key restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. President Trump's decision to withdraw from the accord has raised concerns among some Members of Congress and some in the international community. Iran has an active missile development program and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs at varying stages of activity and capability. Iran is widely believed to be unlikely to use chemical or biological weapons or to transfer them to its regional proxies or allies because of the potential for international powers to discover their origin and retaliate against Iran for any use. Iran appears to be able to defend against any conceivable aggression from Iran's neighbors, while lacking the ability to project conventional military power outside the region or across waterways. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) controls the Basij (Mobilization of the Oppressed) volunteer militia that has been the main instrument to repress domestic dissent and has a national defense role. The IRGC and the regular military (Artesh) report to a joint headquarters. The appointment of an IRGC officer to head the joint headquarters again demonstrates the IRGC's dominance within Iran's military and security structure. In April 2019, the Supreme Leader appointed a new IRGC Commander-in-Chief, IRGC Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, to replace IRGC Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari. Both are hardliners and IRGC operations and its political orientation are not expected to change.
Naming a Navy ship for a living person is a long-standing practice in the United States Navy, dating back to the early days of the nation's republic. The practice of naming ships after living persons was relatively commonplace up through 1814, when a US Navy brig was named in honor of Thomas Jefferson. However, after the War of 1812, with the US Navy older and more established, and with the list of famous Americans and notable naval heroes growing ever longer, the practice fell into disuse. The only exception over the next 150 years came in 1900, when the Navy purchased its first submarine from its still living inventor, John Philip Holland, and Secretary of the Navy John D. Long named her USS Holland (SS 1) in his honor. In the early 1970s, however, Department of the Army and Navy leaders were considering the name for CVN 70, the first U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, when Secretary John Warner asked President Richard Nixon's approval to name the ship for Carl Vinson, who served in the House for 50 years and was known as the "Father of the Two-Ocean Navy." Although Secretary Warner felt Congressman Vinson was more than worthy of a ship name, the former Congressman was still alive. Naming a ship for this giant of naval affairs would therefore violate a 160-year old tradition. After considering the pros and cons of doing so, Secretary Warner asked the President for his approval and President Nixon readily agreed. In hindsight, rather than this decision being a rare exception, it signaled a return to the Continental Navy tradition of occasionally honoring famous living persons with a shipname. Since then, and before the appointment of current Secretary Ray Mabus, Navy Secretaries have occasionally chosen to follow this new, "old tradition," naming ships for still living former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Gerald R. Ford, John C. Stennis, and Bob Hope, and Navy Admirals Hyman G. Rickover, Arleigh Burke, and Wayne E. Meyer. In addition, three of these well-known Americans were so honored after Congress enacted provisions in Public Laws urging the Navy to do so. By its own actions, then, Congress has acknowledged the practice of occasionally named ships for living persons, if not outright approved of it. In other words, while naming shipsafter living persons remains a relatively rare occurrence—about three per decade since 1970—it is now an accepted but sparingly used practice for Pragmatic Secretaries [of the Navy] of both parties. For them, occasionally honoring an especially deserving member of Congress, US naval leader, or famous American with a boat name so that they might end their days on earth knowing that their life's work is both recognized and honored by America's Navy-Marine Corps Team, and that their spirit will accompany and inspire the Team in battle, is sometimes exactly the right thing to do. In recent years, the Navy has announced names for ships years before those ships were procured. Although announcing a name for a ship years before it is procured is not prohibited, doing so could deprive a future Navy Secretary (or, more broadly, a future Administration) of the opportunity to select aname for the ship. It could also deprive Congress of an opportunity to express its sense regarding potential names for a ships, and create a risk of assigning a name to a ship that eventually is not procured for some reason, a situation that could be viewed as potentially embarrassing to the Navy.
The program activities of most federal agencies are generally funded on an annual basis through the enactment of 12 regular appropriations acts. When those annual appropriations acts are not enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year (i.e., by October 1), one or more continuing appropriations acts may be enacted to provide temporary funding to continue certain programs and activities. Such funding is provided for a specified period of time, which may be extended through subsequent CRs. A continuing appropriations act is commonly referred to as a continuing resolution or CR because it has typically been in the form of a joint resolution rather than a bill. There is no procedural requirement as to its form. Continuing appropriations are also occasionally provided through a bill, but there is no requirement that they be enacted into law. If appropriations are not enacted for a fiscal year through a regular appropriations act or a CR, a "funding gap" occurs until such appropriations are provided. When a funding gap occurs, federal agencies may be directed to begin a "shutdown" of the affected programs or activities. Agencies are generally prohibited from obligating or expending federal funds in the absence of appropriations. Congress has enacted a continuing appropriations measure (CR) in all but three of the 43 fiscal years since FY1977. In total, 186 CRs were enacted during the period covering FY1977-FY2019, ranging from zero to 21 in any single fiscal year. During this period, Congress provided funding by means of a CR for an average of almost five months (143 days) in each of the 22 fiscal years. On average, each of these 117 CRs lasted for about 39 days; 53 of these were for seven days or fewer. CRs have included six typical main components: coverage, duration, funding rate, restrictions on new activities, anomalies, and legislative provisions. For example, the first CR for FY2010, P.L. 111-68, provided funding for most of the activities funded in prior fiscal years' appropriations acts for which the current fiscal year's regular appropriations have yet to be enacted. The duration and amount of funds in a CR may be adjusted through anomalies, such as providing a specific amount or rate of budget authority for certain accounts or activities that is different than the funding rate provided for the remainder of activities in the CR. In some instances, legislative provisions—which create, amend, or extend other laws—have been included in CRs as well. The use of CRs has been a significant element of the recent annual appropriations process. Since FY1977, the start of the federal fiscal year has been moved from July 1 to October 1 by the Congressional Budget Act. In all but four of these fiscal years (FY1977, FY1989, FY1995, FY1997, and FY1997), regular appropriations were enacted before October 1. As a result, Congress has often needed to use CRs to prevent funding gaps and secure additional increments of time to complete the remaining regular appropriations bills. This report provides an overview of the components of continuing resolutions (CRs) and information about congressional practices related to their use. The first section of this report explains six of the typical major components of CR's: coverage; duration; funding rate; restrictions; anomalies; legislative provisions; and congressional provisions. The second section discusses the number and duration of all CRs enacted, beginning with FY1977 and ending with FY2019. The third section provides information on the variation in the number, length, and length of each CR enacted each fiscal year after FY1997. The fourth section of the report discusses the features of the 15 "full-year CRs" enacted during this period.
Fiscal policy is the means by which the government adjusts its budget balance through spending and revenue changes to influence broader economic conditions. According to mainstream economics, the government can impact the level of economic activity, generally measured by gross domestic product (GDP), in the short term by changing its level of spending and tax revenue. Expansionary fiscal policy—an increase in government spending, a decrease in tax revenue, or a combination of the two—is expected to spur economic growth, whereas contractionary fiscal Policy—a decrease in government Spending, an increase in Tax Revenue, or some combination of both— is expected to slow economic growth. When the government's budget is running a deficit, fiscal policy is said to be expansionary: when it is running an surplus, fiscal policies are said to have been contractionary. This report provides an overview of fiscal policy in the context of the U.S. economy and discusses some of the potential effects of fiscal stimulus on the economy. The federal government has generally been running a budget deficit for much of the past 30 years—save for two short periods in the 1960s and 1990s. This suggests that the government has been applying some level of fiscalstimulus to the economy for the past three decades, although the level has increased and decreased over time. However, simply examining the overall budget deficit to judge fiscal stimulus can be misleading, as the levels of federal spending and revenues differ over time automatically due to changes in the state of the economy, rather than deliberate choices made each year by Congress. During economic expansions, tax revenue tends to increase and spending tends to decrease automatically, as rising incomes and employment result in higher average incomes and therefore greater individual and corporate income tax revenues. Federal spending on income support programs, such as food stamps and unemployment insurance, tends to fall as fewer people need financial assistance and unemployment claims fall during economic expansions. The opposite is true during recessions, when federal spending rises and revenue shrinks. Therefore, when examining fiscal policy, it is often beneficial to estimate the budget deficit excluding these automatic stabilizers, referred to as the structural deficit, to get a sense of the affirmative fiscal policy decisions made by Congress each year. The budget deficit then tends to shrink as the economy enters into recovery and fiscal stimulus is less necessary to support economic growth; however, in recent years, the federal budget has bucked this trend. After the structural deficits peaked in 2009 at roughly 7.5% of GDP, it began to decline through 2014, falling to about 2.0%. However, beginning in 2016, in spite of relatively strong economic conditions, it has started to rise again. Given that the economy is arguably at or exceeding full employment currently, the increase in fiscal stimulus since 2016 is notable. As discussed earlier, expanding fiscal stimulus during an economic expansion can result in rising interest rates, a growing trade deficit, and higher inflation. As of publication of this report, interest rates and inflation do not appear to be affected by the additional fiscal stimulus; interest rates are at historic lows and inflation shows no signs of acceleration. The trade deficit has been growing, however, and it is not clear that this growth in the trade deficit is a result of increased fiscal stimulus. In the long term, persistent fiscal stimulus, and the associated budget deficits, can lead to an unsustainable level of public debt. A rising debt-to-GDP ratio can be problematic if the perceived or real risk of the government defaulting on that debt begins to rise. The threshold at which a nation's debt becomes unsustainable depends on a number of factors, including the denomination of the debt, political circumstances, and, potentially most importantly, underlying economic condition.
The existence and treatment of political prisoners in Burma (Myanmar) has been a central issue in the formulation of U.S. policy toward Burma for more than 25 years. The arrest, detention, prosecution, and imprisonment of Burmese political prisoners—including Aung San Suu Kyi—frequently were cited as reasons for imposing political and economic sanctions on Burma and the leaders of its ruling military junta. When announcing waivers of existing sanctions, the Obama Administration often cited progress on the release of politicalprisoners as evidence for why the waiver was warranted. During a discussion of the human rights situation in Burma during the 34th session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in March 2017, William J. Mozdzierz, Director of the Office of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs within the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs, stated that the United States was "concerned by new political arrests under the current [Burmese] government," and urged "the [Burma] government to immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners, and to drop charges against individuals for taking part in protected political activities." What actions, if any, the 116th Congress or the Trump Administration may take with respect to U. S. policy towards Burma may hinge, in part, on the issue of political prisoner in Burma. Eight years have passed since Burma's ruling junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), transferred power over to a newly reconstituted Union Parliament and President Thein Sein, a retired general and the SPDC's last Prime Minister. In 2016, the National League for Democracy (NLD)-led government assumed control over the Union Parliament after the NLD's landslide victory in the 2015 parliamentary elections. Although both the TheinSein and NLD-led governments periodically pardoned political prisoners and granted pardons, authorities continue to arrest, detain, prosecute, and imprison people for peacefully expressing their political opinions. One reason that controversy over political imprisonment persists in Burma is the lack of agreement on the definition of "political prisoner." The United States considers someone a political prisoner if 1. the person is incarcerated in accordance with a law that is, on its face, illegitimate; the law may be illegitimate if the defined offense either impermissibly restricts the exercise of a human right; or is based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular group; 2. theperson is incarcerated pursuant to alaw that is legitimate, where the incarceration is based in part on false charges where the underlying motivation is based upon race or religion, or for politically motivated acts; or 3. person who receives unduly harsh and disproportionate treatment or punishment because of race or nationality, or political opinion. The State Department generally does not include those who, regardless of their motivation, have gone beyond advocacy and dissent to commit acts of violence. In Burma, one of the more critical issues in defining political prisoners is whether or not to include individuals who have been detained for their alleged association with Burma's ethnic-based militias or their associated political parties. Because these militias periodically have been involved in armed conflict with the Burma military, some analysts exclude detainees allegedly associated with the militias from their estimates of Burma's political prisoners. The number of political Prisoners in Burma fluctuates over time, depending on the termination of prison sentences, the status of pending trials, and the arrest and detention of new alleged political prisoners by Burma's security forces. The Assistance Association of Political Prisoners (Burma), or AAPP(B), in its monthly report on political prisoners has been used as a comparatively reliable estimate of the number of Burma political prisoners for over a decade. The monthly reports include a description of related events of the past month and a detailed list containing the names, alleged violation, prison (where applicable), sentence (if applicable), and political affiliation (if any) of each political prisoner. As of the end of April 2019, there were 331 political prisoners of conscience in Burma, including 48 serving prison sentences and 193 awaiting trial outside of prison. This report will not be updated.
FDA and USDA are responsible for overseeing the safety of the food supply, including the production of cell-cultured meat, which is meat derived from animal cells that were grown in a controlled environment outside of the animal. FDA and USDA cooperate with states, tribes, and local food safety and public health agencies to carry out their responsibilities. GAO was asked to review FDA's and USDA's efforts to oversee cell- cultured meat. This report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing cell- Cultured meat and (2) examines the extent to which FDA and USDA are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell Cultured Meat. To address these objectives, GAO conducted a literature review of journal and media articles from 2016 through 2019, attended public meetings and conferences, and interviewed officials from FDA, USDA, and other federal and nonfederal stakeholders, and conducted site visits to facilities and laboratories. Specific information about the process of making cell- cultured meat is available, but specific information on the technology being used and the eventual commercial production methods as well as the final products is not yet known. While firms may vary in how they make Cell-Cultured Meat, the general process they use can be described in five phases. These phases include biopsy, cell banking, cell growth, harvest, and food processing. The technology to produce cell-culture meat at a commercial scale is still in development, and the methods to be used for commercial production and the composition of the final product are not yet know. Cell-culturing meat firms are in the middle stage of building and testing their prototypes, and as a result, they have not finalized aspects of the technology and eventual commercial methods to use or the composition and final product. As a result of this lack of information, stakeholders--including cell-ultured meat firms themselves, regulators and the public--are limited in their ability to make regulatory and other decisions. For example, agency officials and other stakeholders told GAO that they must largely rely on whatever information the firms are willing to provide to understand details of the companies' prototype processes and products. This limitation can affect agencies' ability to regulate this new food. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have taken steps to collaborate on their shared oversight of Cell- culturing meat, including establishing an interagency agreement and three working groups. However, the agreement only partially incorporates the seven leading practices for interagency collaboration that can enhance and sustain agencies' collaborative efforts, such as defining outcomes and monitoring accountability. In addition, the working groups either partially incorporate or do not incorporate these leading practices, which has raised concerns about potential fragmentation or overlap in oversight. By more fully incorporating all seven practices for collaboration, FDA andUSDA could build on their existing efforts and be better positioned to sustain and enhance their collaborative efforts. The agencies have not formally documented which agency will oversee cellcultured seafood other than catfish. By taking steps to document this decision, FDA will better ensure that the public and other key stakeholders have clarity about the agencies' oversight responsibilities.
EPA's federal advisory committees play an important role in advising the agency on a wide range of environmental regulatory matters, including issues such as air quality, public health and safety, and environmental justice. GAO was asked to review EPA's process for appointing members to its advisory committees. This report describes (1) the process EPA uses to appoint members to advisory committees, (2) the extent to which EPA followed its established process from fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018, and (3) how, if at all, selected characteristics of EPA's advisory committees changed after January 2017. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed EPA's Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) handbook and other agency documents and interviewed EPA officials. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) established process includes three main phases. These phases are soliciting nominations, evaluating candidates, and obtaining approvals from relevant EPA offices before the Administrator or Deputy Administrator makes final appointment decisions. For example, a committee's designated federal officer solicits nominations by, for example, writing to professional associations and emailing specific EPA email distribution lists. In addition, a deputy ethics official is to review financial disclosure forms for any prospective members who are required to file these forms in connection with their appointments to EPA advisory committees and certify by signature and date that the filer is in compliance with federal ethics rules, and this official generally may delegate this responsibility. From fiscal year (FY) 2017 through FY 2018, EPA appointed or reappointed 20 members to two of its 22 advisory committees—the Small Business Administration (SAB) and the Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC). SAB is the agency's largest committee and CASAC is responsible for, among other things, reviewing national ambient air-quality standards. EPA's established process calls for agency staff to document in appointment packets their rationales for recommending the candidates they deem best qualified and most appropriate for achieving balanced committee membership. However, EPA did not follow a key step in its appointment process for these two committees in FY 2018. Specifically, the FY 2018 appointment packets for these committees did not include draft membership grids, which are intended to reflect EPA staff input on the best qualified candidates. EPA officials told GAO in March 2019 that they did not prepare these grids because EPA management requested a series of briefings instead. EPA management then decided whom to appoint after reviewing the entire list of personnel nominated for membership—not a short-list of staff-recommended candidates, as called for by EPA's handbook. EPA also did not consistently ensure that committee members appointed as special government employees (SGEs) met federal ethics requirements, and as part of its periodic review of its ethics program, it did not evaluate through audits or spot-checks the quality of financial disclosure reviews conducted by deputy ethics officials for these committee members. Until EPA periodically evaluates—for example, through audits and spot checks—the quality of these reviews, it will not have reasonable assurance that it will address noncompliance with federal Ethics Act requirements and prevent conflicts of interest among SGEs appointed to EPA Advisory Committees. The committee composition, regional affiliation, membership turnover, and number of committee meetings changed notably for four of 18 of EPAs advisory committees for which GAO examined after January 17, 2017, compared to the period after January 2009. There were no notable changes in the four characteristics for the other 14 committees GAO analyzed for which it reviewed at least one of the characteristics. For the four committees, the percentage of members affiliated with academic institutions on the SAB decreased by 27 percentage points (36 of 47 members) or from 77 percent (76 of 77 members) on January 19, 2009, to 50 percent (22 of 44 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2018. There was no notable change in the number of meetings committees held for the remaining four committees. The percentage of committee members with an academic affiliation decreased by 45 percentage points, or from 65 percent (11 of 17 members) to 20 percent (3 of 15 members) after January 20, 2013.
DOD has a global real estate portfolio that supports the department's global workforce and readiness to execute its national security missions. The department has repeatedly acknowledged the threats of extreme weather and climate change effects to its installations, and has begun taking steps to increase the resilience of its infrastructure to these threats. Senate Report 115-130, accompanying a bill for fiscal year 2018 appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies, included a provision for GAO to review DOD's progress in developing a means to account for potentially damaging weather in its project designs. In response, GAO examined the extent to which DOD has taken steps to incorporate resilience into (1) installation master plans and related planning documents, and (2) individual installation facilities projects. GAO visited or requested information from a non-generalizable sample of 23 installations in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories that had identified one or more climate-related vulnerabilities, based on their past experiences, in a DOD-administered survey of climate vulnerabilities, or installations that were referenced in a prior GAO report on climate and weather risks at DOD installations. This is a public version of a sensitive but unclassified report GAO issued in November 2017. Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been redacted. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken some actions to increase resilience to extreme weather or climate effects at its installations. For example, in response to a statutory requirement, DOD updated its Unified Facilities Criteria on master planning in November 2018 to require installations to consider and incorporate reliable and authorized sources of data on changing environmental conditions. However, DOD does not provide guidance to installations on what sources of climate projections to use and how to use them in designing facilities projects, such as how to incorporate projections involving multiple future scenarios or what future time periods to consider. In addition, DOD's standard for master planning provides requirements and guidance for installation master planning but not for the design of individual projects. As a result, installations may be investing in facilities projects without considering potential risks, including potential future damage and degradation, which are associated with additional costs and reductions in capability. By seeking to anticipate future climate conditions, DOD may be able to reduce climate- related risks to its facilities and the corresponding budgetary risks. Eleven of the 23 installations GAO reviewed had designed or constructed one or several individual facilities projects that included elements of resilience to climate change or extreme weather, but most installations had not considered climate projections in their facilities project designs, as GAO's prior work has found that using the best available climate information, including forward-looking projections, can help an organization to manage climate risks. For instance, one installation designed a project to build a maintenance hangar with a special foundation that would elevate the floor to 10 feet above the average high-water level at the project site and protect it against coastal storm flooding. DOD guidance states that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment provides guidance and direction on relevant technologies, engineering standards, tools, development and use of scenarios, and other approaches to enable prudent climate change adaptation and resilience. The guidance also states that military departments are to leverage authoritative environmental prediction sources for appropriate data and analysis products to assess the effects of climate and climate. DOD's guidance also requires the military departments to assess and manage risks to both built and natural infrastructure, including making changes, as appropriate, to design and construction standards. DOD has not required in the standard that guides master planning that installations assess risks posed by extreme weather as part of their master plans or develop plans to address identified risks. By assessing and developing actions to address these risks, installations could better anticipate exposure of the facilities to greater than anticipated damage or degradation as a result of extremeWeather events or climate change.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees the federal standards nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including standards for the quality of care. In 2016, CMS finalized a comprehensive update to its nursing home standards to reflect new requirements and align requirements with current clinical practices, among other things. The changes were implemented in three phases, starting November 28, 2016. GAO was asked to review issues related to abuse in nursing homes. This report examines (1) trends in nursing home abuse and (2) the extent to which CMS has key information critical to understanding and appropriately addressing abuse and its oversight of nursing homes, including the prevention, identification, and timely investigation of abuse. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed CMS data from 2013 through 2017, the most recent 5-year period for which data were available at the time of GAO's review, reviewed CMS guidance, and interviewed officials from CMS, state survey agencies, law enforcement, and other stakeholders in five states selected based on variation in factors such as population size and geographic location. From 2013 to 2017, abuse deficiencies—defined as deficiencies that caused actual harm to residents or put residents in immediate jeopardy—increased from 4,899 to 5,383 in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and the District of Columbia, according to CMS data GAO reviewed. These deficiencies were cited by state surveyors when a nursing home fails to keep a resident free from abuse, which encompasses mental/verbal, sexual, or physical abuse. In addition, the number of homes with abuse deficiencies more than doubled from 394 in 2013 to 821 in 2017, with the largest increase in severe cases. In 2017, 42.6 percent of the 875 abuse deficiencies cited were categorized as causing actual harm or posing immediate jeopardy to residents, compared to 31.9 percent in 2013. The majority of abuse deficiencies were identified through either a complaint investigation or a facility-reported incident investigation. In contrast, for all types of deficiencies, the vast majority were identified by surveyors through standard surveys, which are a comprehensive assessment designed to determine whether nursing homes are complying with Medicare or Medicaid quality standards. For example, one deficiency code for abuse of residents encompasses mental or verbal abuse; while a few additional deficiency codes encompass abuse-related issues, such as a failure by the nursing home to train staff on issuesrelated to abuse. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) does not require CMS to record information on abuse and perpetrator type in two of CMS's datasets—complaints/facility-reported incidents and deficiencies—which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards directing management to use quality information to achieve program objectives. As a result, CMS lacks key information on the most prevalent types of abuse and perpetrators in its data and, therefore, cannot take actions—such as tailoring prevention and investigation activities—to address the most common abuse or perpetrators. Further, CMS has not provided guidance on what information should be included in facility- reported incidents, contributing to a lack of information for surveyors and, subsequently, delays in their investigations. CMS also has numerous gaps in its referral process that can result in delayed and missed referrals of abuse to law enforcement and other entities. These gaps affect critical points in CMS's oversight of abuse—including the prevention and identification of abuse, and may limit CMS's ability to ensure that nursing homes meet federal requirements for residents to be free from Abuse.
The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) manages the Idaho National Laboratory's (INL) Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU) reengineering project, which is intended to repair and reengineer the IWTU and begin treating the sodium-bearing waste (SBW) and calcine waste (waste produced in the later stages of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing) at INL. GAO was asked to review the project. This report examines (1) the extent to which EM's management of the project follows selected project management best practices; (2) challenges EM faces in the disposal of the SBW; and (3) challenges it faces in treating and disposing of the calcine Waste. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed project documents and interviewed officials from EM and its contractor, Fluor Idaho, LLC; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies; and conducted a site visit to INL in December 2017. EM has not fully followed selected best practices for cost and schedule estimates, and unreliable data may limit EM's ability to measure the project's performance. For example, EM partially met best practices in developing a comprehensive cost estimate and a well-constructed schedule estimate for the I WTU reengineering. For the cost estimate, EM did not fully meet best practices because it did not account for all possible costs and did not have a standard, product-oriented work breakdown structure to facilitate the tracking of resource allocations and expenditures. In addition, EM's schedule did not include activities that were logically sequenced; a valid critical path; and a reasonable amount of total float, meaning an accurate reflection of the schedule's flexibility. EM generally followed best practices to measure project performance and has taken some steps toward meeting requirements under DOE's process for monitoring projects with start-up risks, such as developing and executing an operational release plan and providing progress updates to DOE's Project Management Risk Committee (PMRC) on the project each quarter. EM faces three main challenges to its plans to dispose of SBW at its preferred disposal site at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico, but it does not yet have a strategy or a timeline to address these challenges. First, the WIPP permit prohibits the disposition of waste that has ever been managed as high-level waste (HLW) at WIPP unless the disposal is specifically approved through a permit modification. Second, federal law prohibits HLW from being disposed of at the facility, and there are existing capacity limitations to disposal at the site. Third, EM faces challenges implementing its selected treatment technology for SBW and faces uncertainties with a waste disposal pathway. As a result, EM is suspending further development of its plan to treat the waste for land disposal, according to EM documents and officials. EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials told GAO that the agency is continuing to make progress toward its milestones by considering alternatives for processing the waste and conducting a pilot project to remove it from the oldest storage vessel. However, EM has no strategy or timeline for determining its next steps for the ultimate treatment and disposal of calcine wastes. According to standards for internal control, federal agency management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving a defined objective. Until it develops such a strategy, including a timeline, to implement the actions required to achieve the preferred disposal pathway or an alternative, EM will not have reasonable assurance that it can achieve its preferred plan for disposal or begin identifying an alternative.
As part of the rulemaking process, federal agencies are required to publicly post information about their rulemaking activities on their websites, such as Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites, to facilitate the public comment process. GAO was asked to review how selected agencies are addressing the identity of commenters. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which selected agencies collect identity information from commenters, (2) how the selected agencies treat identity information during the comment process, and (3) how these agencies communicate their posting practices to the public. This statement is based on GAO's June 2019 report, GAO-2019-11-854 . The selected agencies GAO reviewed collect some information from commenters and accept anonymous comments through regulations.gov. Consistent with the discretion afforded by the Administrative Policy Act of 1974 (APA), the 10 selected agencies use required and optional fields on comment forms to collect some identity data from commenters. In addition to the text of the comment, agencies may choose to collect identity data by requiring commenters to fill in other fields such as name, address, and email address before they are able to submit a comment. Regardless of the fields required by the comment form, the agencies all accept anonymous comment in practice. The APA does not require agencies to authenticate submitted identity information, and GAO found that the 10 agencies' treatment of identity information varies during the three phases of the public comments process. For example, agencies differ in how they post duplicate comments, which can lead to identity information being inconsistently presented to public users of comment systems. The agencies' practices associated with posting identity information are not always documented or clearly communicated to public Users of comment websites. The E-Government Act of 2002 requires that all public comments and other materials associated with a given rulemaking should be made “publicly available online to the extent practicable.” In addition, key practices for transparently reporting open government data state that federal government websites should fully describe the data that are made available, including by disclosing data sources and limitations. The 10 agencies do not effectively communicate the limitations and inconsistencies in how the agencies post identity information associated with public comments. As a result, public users lack information related to data availability and limitations that could affect their ability to use and make informed decisions about the comment data and effectively participate in the rule making process themselves. Seven of the 10 federal agencies have documented some internal guidance associated with the identities of commenters during the intake, analysis, and response to comments phases. However, the focus and substance of this guidance varies by agency. For selected agencies that have such guidance, it most frequently relates to the comment intake or response to comment phases. The guidance for these phases addresses activities such as managing duplicate comments (those with identical or near-identical comment text but varied identity information) or referring to commenters in a final rule.
The Medicare hospice benefit covers a variety of services and supplies for the palliation and management of the terminal illness, including physician and nursing services, medical equipment and supplies including drugs for pain and symptom management, hospice aide and homemaker services, physical and occupational therapy, and spiritual and grief and loss counseling. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for overseeing the quality of hospice care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of hospices. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which hospice providers' quality of care varies between for-profit and non-profit hospices and (2) opportunities to strengthen CMS's hospice oversight through increased use of information in the survey process and expanded statutory authority for enforcement. To do this work, GAO analyzed CMS data on hospice provider quality measures and hospice beneficiary data from 2014 through 2017, reviewed CMS documents, and interviewed CMS officials, researchers, and other experts. In 2017, about 1.5 million Medicare beneficiaries were treated by hospices under the Medicare Hospice Benefit. For-profit providers treated about 50 percent of these beneficiaries, while non-profits treated about 48 percent, according to GAO's analysis of CMS data. For example, in 2017, for-profits provided about $10.4 billion (58 percent) of the $17.9 billion dollars in Medicare payments to hospices for hospice services, compared to $7.2 billion (40 percent) for non- nonprofits. The percentage of beneficiaries treated by for- Profit Hospices Compared to Non-Profit Hospices GAO found that the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries who received different types of provider visits (e.g., medical social workers, chaplains or spiritual counselors, licensed practical nurses, or hospice aides in the last 7 days of life) varied by provider, but was generally higher for for- profit providers. In addition, the percentages of beneficiaries who were discharged prior to death (often referred to as the live discharge rate) and who received medical and emotional support near the end of a beneficiary's life (referred to as live discharge rates) also varied by hospice. In its review of CMS's Oversight of Hospice Providers: Opportunities Exist to Strengthen CMS Oversight through Increased Use of Information in Survey Process and Expanded Statutory Authority for Enforcement CMS could strengthen its oversight by using additional information to enhance the hospice survey process. CMS does not instruct surveyors to review providers' performance on CMS quality measures (those based on provider-reported quality data or caregivers' experience surveys) or other indicators of quality that could identify potential areas of concern. CMS issues guidance that surveyors use when conducting hospice surveys to assess a hospices' compliance with federal health and safety requirements. According to this guidance, surveyors are to prepare for hospices surveys by reviewing documents of record including licensure records, previous survey findings and complaints, media reports, and publicly available information about the provider. However, CMS officials told GAO they do not use such information to target hospices to focus on more closely for additional review during surveys. By not utilizing additional information in its survey process that would allow it to identify providers and areas where risk of noncompliance is greatest, CMS is missing an opportunity to strengthen its ability to identify and respond to such risks and ensure the quality and safety of care that hospice beneficiaries receive. CMS is limited to one hospice enforcement remedy—termination of the Medicare provider agreement. By law, to qualify for Medicare payment, hospices must meet the program's conditions of participation. If the agency finds a provider is not complying with these conditions, CMS may terminate the provider's participation in the program. In the Medicare program, termination is the most significant action CMS can take to address provider non-compliance. In contrast, Congress has given the agency authority to impose additional enforcement remedies for other provider types, such as civil money penalties, denial of payment for all new Medicare and Medicaid admissions, and imposition of training requirements for situations where it is determined that education will likely lead to provider compliance. Such remedies, if available, could enable the agency to more effectively address a broader range of hospICE risks.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relies on third-party providers, such as paid preparers and tax software providers, to help it collect, store, and process taxpayers' income tax returns. GAO was asked to review IRS's efforts to protect taxpayer information from identity theft refund fraud. In this report, GAO (1) assesses what is known about the taxpayer information security requirements for the systems used by third party providers, (2) describes IRS's outreach efforts to third- party providers on the requirements, (3) assesss IRS's monitoring processes for ensuring providers' compliance with requirements, and (4) evaluates IRS's requirements for third party provider security incident reporting and how IRS uses that information. To address these objectives GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, guidance, and IRS documents; interviewed IRS officials; and conducted semistructured interviews with 10 industry groups and related organizations that represented a cross section of the tax preparation industry. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provided insights on IRS's information security efforts. IRS seeks to help safeguard taxpayers' information and the electronic filing system by prescribing requirements for various types of third parties through its Authorized e-file Provider program. These requirements are outlined in IRS's Revenue Procedure 2007-40 and Publication 1345, Handbook for Authorized IRS E-file Providers of Individual Income Tax Returns. However, IRS has not fully incorporated the Federal Trade Commission Safeguards Rule, which requires financial institutions, including tax return preparers, to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, into its requirements for all provider types under this program. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act provided FTC with the authority to require that financial institutions subject to its jurisdiction protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such records; and protect against unauthorized access to such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. FTC, in turn, issued a regulation known as the “FTC Safeguard Rule,” which requires those institutions to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security programs. The program must contain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are appropriate to the provider's size and complexity, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. IRS addresses the FTC Safeguarding Rule through its Revenue Procedure, which clearly states that violations may subject an Authorized E-File Provider to penalties or sanctions, including suspension or expulsion from the program. While IRS publications that provide further information on the program only briefly discuss the rule, they do not provide details on the required elements of an information security program. Modifying its requirements to explicitly state the elements of a security program as required under the FTCsafeguards rule would help IRS ensure that all types of providers are aware of, and comply with, the rule and could help them better protect taxpayers' data. IRS does not outline a set of minimum information security standards for systems used to prepare tax returns or for online providers, which allow individuals to prepare their own tax returns and file them with IRS. Instead, IRS only requires that online providers comply with six security, privacy, and business standards that were established in 2010, but has not updated these standards since then. Without updating standards regularly, the standards can become outdated and lose their ability to protect information from known vulnerabilities as technology changes. IRS uses various outreach tools to communicate with third-Party Providers about information security risks. For example, IRS informs tax professionals about ways to improve information security practices and the benefits of doing so. IRS also hosts webinars throughout the year to inform tax professionals and taxpayers about various topics, including information security, but faces a challenge reaching preparers who are not affiliated with larger industry groups or who do not visit the IRS.gov website, according to both IRS officials and industry group officials.
The CCDF is the main federal law governing state child-care programs for low-income working families. OCC, a program office within the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF), is responsible for overseeing and protecting the integrity of the CCDF program. GAO was asked to review OCC's oversight of states' program-integrity activities. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which OCC oversees states' oversight of CCDF programs and (2) the steps OCC has taken to ensure that states' corrective actions to reduce improper payments are aimed at root causes of improper payments and effectively implemented. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed OCC documents and interviewed OCC officials. The Office of Child Care and Developmental Services (OCC) provides oversight of state programs that are susceptible to significant improper-payment risks but lacks documented guidance for assessing states' proposed corrective actions. Since 2013, seven states with improper payment error rates at or above 10 percent have submitted 14 corrective action plans (CAP) to OCC for review. However, OCC does not have any documented criteria to guide the review of the CAPs to ensure the proposed actions are targeted to root causes and are effectively implemented, and OCC also has not documented the procedures it uses to follow up with states subject to CAPs, but said it is planning to do so. Without written policies for its CAP follow-up process or documentation that follow up has been completed for past CAPs and without documented criteria for its staff to use in reviewing states' CAPs for future review and approval periods (fiscal years 2019–2021), OCC lacks assurance that the corrective actions a state proposes to reduce its improper payments will be specifically aimed at the root cause of the improper payment and effectively implement. The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) requires federal agencies to report on actions the agency is taking to reduce the risk of and prevent improper payments. OMB guidance implementing IPERA states that agencies should ensure that each corrective action is aimed at a root cause and is effectively implemented to prevent and reduce improper payment. According to this guidance, a root causes is something that would directly lead to an improper payment if corrected and, if corrected, would prevent it. Further, in the proposed rulemaking that OCC introduced CAPs in 2013, it stated that they were intended to be comprehensive and detailed, so as to improve upon the descriptions of corrective actions already reported on a 3-year cycle, which sometimes lack detail or specificity. O CC officials told GAO that they plan to develop such written policies, but did not specify a timeline for completion. Having established written policies will help ensure that O CC's oversight and monitoring of CAPs is carried out consistently. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)—the agency within HHS that administers the Child care and development block grant (CCDF) program—has taken some steps to monitor states' integrity activities, but does not assess the effectiveness of these activities. For example, in response to a 2016 HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) report, ACF officials said OCC would use the Grantee Internal Controls Self-Assessment Instrument to address the report's recommendations to request that states examine their program integrity and fraud-fighting activities, and examine with states the benefits of expanding such activities. In addition to making the tool available to states, O CC also provides technical assistance in completing the tool, which may include an on-site facilitated discussion, to help states improve program integrity. In fiscal year 2019, as of August 2019, 19 states have completed the tool. OSS Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. In doing so, management identifies the information needed and defines the information requirements at the relevant level and requisite specificity for appropriate personnel. Standards for internal control in the federal government also requires that management develop and maintain documentation of its internal control system, which is a continuous, built-in component of operations that provides reasonable assurance that an entity's objective will be achieved.
PMIAA requires OMB, OPM, and the 24 agencies listed in the Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990 to, among other things, adopt government-wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project management for executive agencies. GAO was asked to review OMB's implementation of PMIAA. This report examines: (1) the steps taken by OMB and other agencies to implement the act; (2) the extent to which OMB is using or planning to use portfolio reviews required in PMIAa to address issues on GAO's High-Risk List; and (3) how OMB has provided methods for agencies to assess the results of the program portfolio reviews. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed OMB documents, interviewed OMB staff, and interviewed officials from five agencies selected based on their experience with program management. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) have taken some steps to implement program management reforms required by the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (PMIAa) of 2016, but actions remain to fully implement the law. For example, OMB developed a five-year strategic plan to guide agencies' implementation of the act, and OPM has issued policy and guidance to help agencies identify and develop the skills and competencies needed to manage programs and projects. OMB also established a Program Management Policy Council (PMPC) to serve as an interagency forum for improving agency practices related to program management and has met with the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies three times in 2018 and 2019 to discuss implementation plans. However, the PMPC has not established any working groups to help execute its significant responsibilities to share leading practices, develop standards, and help improve the workforce. In addition, agencies have taken initial steps to incorporate requirements into program efforts, such as identifying a prime management officer (PMIO) and developing strategies and actions for enhancing training and improving recruitment and retention of program and projects managers, but OMB reported that the majority of agencies only partially included OMB requirements in their draft implementation plans and that they have not directed agencies to address missing requirements nor have they required agencies to finalize their draft plans. Agencies reported in GAO questionnaire responses that they are considering various ways to measure implementation of Prime Ministerial Initiative for Information Assessments of Information Technology (PMI) standards, but have not yet identified specific measures to assess outcomes of PMI. In response to GAO recommendations made in a September 2017 report on PMI standards, the CFO Act agencies reported in a questionnaire that they plan to use existing metrics to assess program performance, but GAO found that OMB had not yet taken any actions in response to the recommendations. In September 2017, GA OMB created a prototype of a dashboard to show cost, schedule, and performance data from each program or project within a portfolio of programs. The dashboard also provides a short description of each program and its strategic alignment to the agency's relevant strategic goal. Moving forward, as the portfolio management process matures, a portion of the dashboard may be available to the public, similar to the IT dashboard, to provide agencies with some visibility and improved transparency for non-IT major acquisitions programs. O MB staff told GAO they are in conversation with agencies about how to overcome difficulties in collecting high-quality data for the dashboard.
This testimony discusses GAO's June 2019 report on abuse in nursing homes, which is being released today. GAO found that while abuse deficiencies cited in the nation's nursing homes were relatively rare from 2013 through 2017, they became more frequent during that time, with the largest increase in severe cases. Specifically, abuse deficiencies more than doubled—from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017—over the 5-year period. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers Medicaid and oversees Medicare, is responsible for ensuring that nursing homes meet federal requirements for residents to be free from abuse. In light of the increased number and severity of abuse deficiencies, it is imperative that CMS have strong nursing home oversight in place to protect residents from abuse; however, we found oversight gaps that may limit the agency's ability to do so. For example, CMS cannot readily access data on the type of abuse or perpetrator, has not provided guidance on what information nursing homes should include in facility-reported incidents, and has numerous gaps in its referral process that can result in delayed and missed referrals to law enforcement. In addition, CMS does not require state survey agencies to report abuse and perpetrator type in CMS's databases for deficiency, complaint, and facility- reported incident data and has not systematically assessed trends in these data. As a result, CMS lacks key information and, therefore, cannot take actions—such as tailoring prevention and investigation activities—to address the most prevalent types of abuse and perpetrators. To address this, GAO recommended that CMS require states to report data on type and perpetrator. HHS concurred with the recommendation and stated that it plans to implement changes in response. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented this recommendation. In June 2019, we also identified gaps in the CMS process for referring incidents of abuse to law law enforcement and, if appropriate, to MFCUs. These gaps may limit CMS' ability to ensure that nursing home residents are free of abuse. Specifically: (1) GAO identified issues related to referring abuse in a timely manner. For instance, law enforcement investigations can be significantly delayed because CMS requires a state survey agency to make referrals only after abuse is substantiated—a process that often takes weeks or months. Officials from one law enforcement agency and two MFCU told GAO the delay in receiving referrals limits their ability to collect evidence and prosecute cases—for example, bedding associated with potential sexual abuse may have been washed, and a victim's wounds may have healed. (2) tracking abuse referrals. For some incidents, CMS has not tracked abuse referrals or defined what it means to substantiate an allegation of abuse—that is, the determination by the state agency that evidence supports the abuse allegation. For other incidents, law police may not be aware of allegations of abuse because they are often underreported by residents, family, staff, and state survey officials, according to CMS officials and stakeholders GAO interviewed. (3) sharing information with law enforcement . For some cases, state law enforcement officials said they sometimes have to conduct significant follow-up with the nursing homes to obtain the information they need to prioritize the incident for investigation—follow-up that delays and potentially negatively affects investigations. In response to GAO recommendations, CMS agreed to take steps to improve its oversight of nursing home abuse, such as requiring state agencies to immediately report any reasonable suspicion of a crime against a resident, but has not implemented these recommendations.
VA provides disability compensation, health care, and other assistance to veterans with service-connected conditions, such as post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, that are related to their military service. In fiscal year 2018, VA obligated about $78 billion for disability compensation and health care for veterans with these conditions. GAO was asked to review VA's disability compensation program. This report examines (1) the extent to which veterans receiving disability compensation use VA health care and (2) how VA uses information on reevaluations to manage the program. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed VA data on veterans' health care use and reevaluation data from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, reviewed VA policies and procedures, and interviewed VA officials in headquarters and four regional offices selected to provide variation in size and location, among other factors. More than half of veterans who received disability compensation used the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) health care system for a service- connected condition in fiscal year (FY) 2018, but the outcomes of this care are not well understood. For example, about 54 percent of veterans, or about 2.6 million, who received compensation had at least one VA outpatient visit related to a service connected condition. Veterans with higher combined disability ratings had more outpatient visits related to these conditions, on average, than veterans with lower combined ratings. In FY 2018, about 13 percent of VA inpatient hospital stays for veterans receiving compensation were to treat a serviceconnected condition; about 87 percent of the stays for this population were for non-service connected conditions. Nearly 2.1 million, or 44 percent of these veterans, had no VA outpatient visits or inpatient stays for their serviceconnected conditions. These veterans may have received treatment paid for through private insurance, from community care, or received no treatment for these conditions in FY 2018. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) tracks its performance in providing veterans with timely and accurate decisions on their disability compensation benefits, and uses such information to manage its claims process. VBA uses information to help gauge the timeliness and quality of reevaluated decisions, but has not fully used information related to the consistency of raters' decisions to address potential training needs. In May 2018, VBA conducted a study to assess how consistently raters across regional offices understood VBA's policies on ordering reevalations. The study team recommended that VBA take two actions: 1. Consider having experienced quality review team staff at regional offices provide additional training to raters and 2. Consider reviewing decisions at the seven lowest-scoring offices because they were at high risk of inaccuracies. However, while VBA provided regional offices with the results of the study, the agency did not implement either recommendation. Federal standards for internal control state that management should establish monitoring activities, evaluate the results, and remediate any deficiencies on a timely basis. By not implementing the study's recommendations, VA is missing an opportunity to identify problems and their root causes as a guide to corrective actions, including training or the improvement of training. In addition, VA has not clearly defined the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for staff to determine when to reevaluate veterans' conditions. In February 2019, VA updated its procedures manual to clarify that raters or "locally designated claims processors" may conduct a pre-exam review to determine whether a reevalization is warranted. VA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found in July 2018 that Veterans Service Representatives (VSRs) were ordering unwarranted exams, resulting in an estimated 15,500 unwarranted reviews of veterans' medical records. VSRs may not be qualified to do so, according to the OIG report and VBA regional staff GAO interviewed in 2019. Federal internal control standards call for management to clearly assign responsibilities and document internal controls, including who should carry out which roles. Without clarifying in the procedures manual which knowledge, Skills and abilities are needed to fill roles in the reevaluating process, VA may be at risk of having unqualified staff continue to order unwarranted reevaluates.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) oversees over 1.2 million foreign students at nearly 9,000 SEVP-certified schools across more than 18,000 campuses in the United States. In 2012, GAO found that ICE did not have a process to assess risks in SEVP and did not consistently implement existing internal controls for determining school eligibility. GAO was asked to review ICE's fraud risk management for SEVP. This report examines the extent to which ICE has (1) taken steps to strengthen its management of fraud risks, (2) implemented controls to address fraud risks in the school certification and recertification processes, and (3) implemented fraud risk controls related to the eligibility, suitability, and training of Designated School Officials (DSO). GAO reviewed ICE documents and interviewed ICE officials, including those responsible for school fraud investigations, and interviewed DSOs at 17 of the 26 ICE field offices selected based on a mix of criteria, including the number of ongoing investigations of certified schools and number of field representatives assigned to or located near the field office. The results of these interviews cannot be generalized to all of ICE's 26 field offices, but provided insights on the process SEVP has established for certifying and monitoring schools, fraud and national security vulnerabilities related to foreign students, and any challenges field offices have faced in their investigations. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) has taken steps since 2012 to strengthen fraud risk-management efforts in response to GAO's prior recommendations. For example, ICE developed a risk-assessment framework and other tools to assist in its efforts to manage fraud risks to the program. However, ICE has not fully developed a fraud risk profile that identifies all of SEVP's fraud risks and assesses the agency's tolerance for these risks. Such a profile would help ICE more effectively assess whether additional internal controls or changes to policies or regulations are needed. ICE also has not yet fully employed data analytics, such as network analysis, to help it identify potentially fraudulent schools before they become certified to enroll foreign students and help it better use its administrative and investigative resources. ICE has also made improvements to its processes for certified schools, but long-standing delays in recertifying schools pose additional fraud risks. In particular, ICE does not conduct recertifications every 2 years, as required by law, and has been extending schools' certification expiration dates beyond the 2-year mark to provide additional time for adjudication. As of June 2018, ICE officials told GAO that there were 3,281 recertify petitions that needed to be adjudicated. While ICE has taken some steps to address these delays, it is unclear whether these actions alone will be adequate to address the delays. Without an assessment of residual risks posed by schools in its queue of recertified schools, ICE cannot ensure that it is effectively addressing the risks of higher-risk schools that continue to operate pending recertifications. In addition, while ICE has implemented controls that mitigate fraud risks related to DSO's eligibility and suitability for participation in the program, weaknesses exist in four key areas. First, while school employees must meet eligibility requirements and pass a criminal-background check to be eligible to serve as D SOs, the agency does not routinely verify DSO-submitted eligibility information in support of their immigration or citizenship status. Second, although ICE has developed a plan to conduct comprehensive background checks on DSO nominees prior to approving them to carry out their reporting, record-keeping, and other functions, it has not developed a documented implementation plan that outlines how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. Third, while the agency has established mechanisms for monitoring DSO usage of student records in SEVIS, it does not have mandatory training for them. Fourth, while DSO training emphasizes student and school compliance with program rules and their responsibilities to enter and maintain complete and accurate information in the student-visitor information system in a timely manner, this training does not include fraud-related training. Without mandatory training and a process for verifying that training is completed, SEVP lacks reasonable assurance that DSO are familiar with, and understand their roles and responsibilities as outlined in program regulation.
Zika is a mosquito-borne disease that can cause symptoms such as fever, rash, conjunctivitis (“pink eye” where the eyes appear red or pink), and joint and muscle pain. It has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage and stillbirth, and severe birth defects. In 2015 and 2016, the Zika virus quickly spread to dozens of countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the virus and associated health risks an international public health emergency. In February 2016, Congress appropriated $175.1 million in supplemental funding to USAID and State for the U.S. Zika response overseas. The Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, included a provision for GAO to review the status of funding for the response to Zika overseas. This report examines (1) USAID's and State's funding for response activities overseas, (2) activities supported by these funds, and (3) challenges, if any, to implementing Zika response activities and actions taken to address any challenges. GAO reviewed agency documents, interviewed agency officials, and conducted fieldwork in selected countries. As of September 30, 2018, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State (State) had obligated about $385 million (99 percent) of the total $390 million available for the Zika Response overseas and had disbursed approximately $264 million (68 percent). Specifically, USAID had obligated all of its funds available for Zika and State had disbursements of more than three-quarters of its funding for Zika. USAID obligated all funds for Zika within a year after they were repurposed or appropriated, and State obligated and disbursement information for most of its Zika funding was not available at the time of GAO's review. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and HHS's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had the highest proportion of Zika response funding (93 percent) compared with HHS's Global Health Programs and Operating Expenses funding (28 percent and 72 percent, respectively), which was appropriated in the Zika response and preparedness appropriations act, 2016 (P.L. 114-295, as amended), in September 2016. HHS and USAID implemented Zika activities in 26 countries, including the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. HHS, State, and implementing partners reported various results from six USAID activities that received among the highest amounts of funding and that together represented approximately 33 percent of all USAID funding. For example, one USAID activity aimed to strengthen health services and systems in Latin America with a focus on pregnant women, newborns, and women of reproductive age. In addition, the Red Cross reported that its communication efforts reached approximately 3,000 students, 29 communities, and almost 140,000 people via TV, radio, and social media engagement, providing them with information on risk and protection methods. State conducted public awareness and communication initiatives, medical evacuations for overseas staff, and other activities. Over the course of fieldwork, GAO and implementing partner officials identified two key challenges to the implementation of Zika activities. First, while USAID took steps to address the challenge related to sustainability, it only partially mitigated the challenge to timely implementation of activities in countries without bilateral USAID health programs. Second, implementing partners in some countries reported that it took additional time to start up activities in those countries because of the time it took to obtain approval for them from the ministries of health. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should design control activities to achieve their objectives and address related risks. In an effort to enhance its planning for outbreaks, in July 2018 USAID developed an infectious disease response plan. However, the plan does not provide specific guidance on how to address how to initiate emergency response activities in such countries. By adding specific guidance for initiating emergency response in these countries to its July 2018 plan—such as by noting particular practices that implementing partners and other officials can use to address that challenge—USAID would be better positioned to quickly build relationships with health ministry and other key government officials in host countries and thus be better able to provide a timely infectious diseases response to future outbreaks.
Fisheries are vulnerable to a number of illicit practices, including illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and forced labor. Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, prohibits the importation of goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions. TFTEA, enacted in 2016, included a provision for GAO to review seafood imports. This report examines (1) the process CBP uses to enforce section 307 for seafood imports and the results of its civil enforcement actions and (2) the external sources of information CBP used to help carry out enforcement of section 307 specific to seafood imports, and stakeholder perspectives on CBP's communication of information needs. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and CBP documents and data pertaining to section 307 enforcement and interviewed officials from CBP and other federal agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and seafood industry stakeholders. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the Department of Homeland Security, uses a four-phase process to enforce violations of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) for seafood and other imports suspected of being produced with forced labor (Section 307). According to CBP officials, the process generally includes four phases: (a) assessing leads to determine whether to initiate a case; (b) investigating cases; (c) reviewing information for legal sufficiency to propose a Worker Release Order (WRO); (d) implementing the WRO and detaining shipments; and (e) deciding not to enter the good into U. S. commerce. CBP has issued one WRO for seafood since February 2016, and as of March 2020, CBP had not issued any civil penalties for seafood-related violations under section 307. In addition, as of the end of 2018, the United States imports billions of dollars' worth of seafood annually and is reliant on those imports for much of the seafood it consumes. To initiate and investigate forced labor cases related to seafood and, as appropriate, other goods,CBP uses information from a variety of external sources, such as media reports, other agencies, and stakeholders, to initiate cases. However, GAO found that CBP may be missing opportunities to obtain key information that stakeholders collect related to forced labor in the seafood industry. For example, in its 2019 Seabound report, Greenpeace included testimonials of migrant fishers that detailed abuse and violent conditions on fishing vessels: “I witnessed horrible torture. We were working even on midnights. When the Fishing Master was angry, he hit my friend's head near his left ear.” According to stakeholders GAO interviewed and GAO's review of CBP information on its website, the agency has not clearly communicated to stakeholders the types of information it needs to initiate or investigate cases, including those involving seafood, to help ensure compliance with the law. As a result, stakeholders are unclear about the type of information they can provide CBP, and some said it is not worth dedicating the time and resources to develop an allegation without a clear sense of what information the agency needs to investigate its cases. Federal standards for internal control establish that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve an agency's objectives. With better communication to stakeholders about the types and level of information needed for initiating and investigating cases, CBC may be able to improve its enforcement efforts through enhanced information from stakeholders.
As DOD increasingly relies on Special Operations Forces (SOF), the department has taken steps to implement section 922 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016 to give the ASD-SO/LIC greater authority to oversee and advocate for the SOF enterprise. Section 922 requires DOD to report to Congress on its progress in implementing the reforms required by law. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to implement the reforms. This report examines the extent to which DOD has (1) identified recommendations, developed actions, and taken other steps to address requirements in section922, and (2) developed a hiring plan to guide future growth of OASD-SO-LIC. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD's report and interviewed DOD officials. In 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) identified 166 recommendations aimed at increasing the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict's (ASD SO/LICS) role in the management of SOF and special operations that are required by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2018. DOD used the 166 recommendations to inform the development of 87 actions in its monthly reports to Congress. DOD has taken various actions, including changes in roles and responsibilities, related to addressing requirements in the section. According to DOD officials, its actions reflect an incremental approach to strengthening OASd-SO and LIC's roles. For example, in February 2019, DOD reported to Congress that it had completed 56 of the 87 actions identified in its February 2019 monthly report. However, based on GAO's analysis of the report, 31 out of 87 identified actions remain unimplemented. Of these 31 actions, three have clear time frames for implementation and 28 actions do not have time frames. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government emphasizes the need to establish time frames to implement actions effectively, and as GAO reported in June 2018, establishing time frames with key milestones and deliverables to track implementation progress are important for agency reform efforts. Failure to do so can have significant consequences, such as potentially resulting in overlap between SOCOM and OASS-SO's functions related to acquisitions. Without time frames, DOD decision-makers may not be well positioned to track progress and evaluate whether or how the completed and pending actions support the full implementation of the new administrative chain of command for SOF-related matters. DOD's Office of Special Operations-Low-Intense Conflict (ASDS-SO) has taken some steps to develop a plan to hire additional personnel, but it has not fully incorporated some key strategic workforce planning principles. In 2017, DOD commissioned the Army Office of Manpower and Reserve Affairs to conduct a manpower study to provide an analysis of manpower requirements based on unconstrained resources that are necessary to satisfy the service secretary-like responsibilities. The Army's manpower study was based on nine functions, including budget, acquisitions, and legislative activities. For each function, the study identified corresponding tasks and the average man hours, or time needed, to complete each task. The study ultimately estimated that up to 64 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions might be needed to implement DOD's new responsibilities, but the study was not comprehensive and the number of FTEs hired increased from 14 in March 2018 to 24 as of December 2018. In December 2018, DOD officials completed a basic hiring plan that includes short-term and long-term hiring goals and a mix of permanent and temporary staff, but does not fully incorporate some leading practices for strategic workforce-planning. As GAO has previously reported, strategic workforce planning addresses two critical needs: aligning an organization's human capital program with its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals; and developing long- term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to achieve programs' goals. While agencies' approaches to workforce planning will vary, we have previously identified several key principles that strategic workforceplanning should address, irrespective of the context in which the planning is done. In addition, the hiring plan did not include strategies to address critical competency gaps and identify related personnel requirements. Without a systematic process to periodically assess personnel requirements, DOD could not determine whether the Army study's initial estimates were the most efficient choice for the workforce.
In fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the U.S. government provided an estimated $243 million for education assistance in the West Bank and Gaza, including $193 million for UNRWA and $50 million for USAID for non-UNRWA education programs, according to the Department of State (State) and USAID data. UNRwA provides education, health care, social services, microfinance, and emergency assistance to Palestine refugees. GAO was asked to review education assistance provided by the United States. This report examines (1) the amount of funding provided for education for fiscal years2015 through 2017 and how it was used; (2) how UNRW and State have identified and addressed potentially problematic content in educational materials; and (3) whether State has submitted required annual reports to Congress on whether UNWRA is taking steps to ensure that the content of all educational materials currently taught in UNRwa-administered schools is consistent with the values of human rights, dignity, and tolerance, and does not induce incitement. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from State, UNR WA, USAID, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRwa) reported expending about $877 million on education in the Palestinian Authority (Palestinian Authority) in fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2017 and purchasing English language textbooks with funds that consistent with contributions from donor countries, including theUnited States. These expenditures included about $671 million for Gaza and about $206 million for West Bank schools. The largest reported expenditure within the education sector was personnel-related expenditures, which represented about 85 percent of all education expenditures. The Palestinian Authority provides all textbooks for all but one academic subject (English) as an in-kind contribution. As such, U. S. funds do not contribute to the textbooks that are published by Palestinian Authority. UNWWA has reviewed Palestinian Authority textbooks for the first semester of grades 1 through 10 to identify content it deemed not aligned with UN values and has developed complementary teaching materials to address this content when considered necessary. However, it did not train teachers on the materials or distribute them to classrooms. Since at least 2015, State has used several means to identify and address Palestinian Authority textbook content it deems problematic, including examining nongovernmental organizations' allegations about problematic textbook content, engaging with Palestinian Authority officials, and monitoring UNRwo's efforts. State submitted required reports in 2015, 2016, and 2017 to Congress, but one report contained inaccurate information and the reports did not include some information that could be useful for congressional oversight. In the annual appropriations acts for FY2015 through FY2017, Congress required State to report on seven different topics, including whether UNRwi is taking actions to address textbook content that is not consistent with its values. State's reports explain how certain educational materials are consistent with certain UN values, such as human rights and tolerance. These values are aligned with the ones that are included in the laws, but GAO found that State's 2017 report to Congress inaccurately described certain actions taken by UNRWI to address content that was not aligned. Specifically, State's report did not specify whether the educational materials were consistent with dignity or not inducing incitement, two of the UN values that UNR Waif applied as part of its Curriculum Framework. In addition, State did not provide details about the nature and extent of content that UNWA identified in Palestinian Authority books as not aligning with these UN values. Inaccurate information could limit the transparency of State's activities and the usefulness of these reports as tools for congressional decision making and oversight.
USDA established the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) Business Center in October 2018 in response to the Secretary of Agriculture's November 2017 memorandum. The Secretary's memorandum called for the establishment of business centers in all of USDA's eight mission areas and three of the 13 major department-level staff offices, including five sub-offices, to provide five types of administrative services: financial management, human resources, information technology, procurement, property management, and property management. The FPAC Business Center is the only business center established as a separate agency within a mission area. GAO was asked to review USDA's business center reform efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which USDA has consolidated administrative services and established business centers and (2) how USDA has assessed the effectiveness and impact of its business center reforms. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed USDA documents and interviewed USDA officials. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has consolidated its administrative services, including business centers, in all eight of its mission areas in accordance with the Secretary's 2017 memorandum, and the business centers vary in their establishment date, structure, and services. In November 2017, the Secretary issued a memorandum to USDA's mission areas to establish business centers to provide administrative services in the field. The business centers are to provide all five of the main administrative services envisioned by the memorandum—specifically, financial management; human resources; information technology; procurement; property management; and human resources. The new business centers were established in November 2017 and, as of November 2019, were providing all five administrative services that the memorandum envisioned. The establishment of the FPAC business centers entailed the most significant transformation of the five business centers since the memorandum. Typically, each business center is located within one of the mission area's component agencies and the center's leader reports directly to that agency's leadership. However, the FPac Business Center was established as an agency within the mission areas' existing agencies. For example, the Farm Services Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Risk Management Agency are the only agencies in the Farm Service Agency mission area that had a business center before the memorandum was issued. USDA's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration told GAO that USDA regularly reviews data on administrative services provided by its business centers. USDA has developed metrics for managing administrative services but has not systematically assessed whether USDA's ability to deliver these services has improved or whether the reforms are meeting the policy goals that the Secretary intended them to achieve. The department has set goals for hiring, fleet vehicles, and travel and conference spending, but it has not developed goals and measures to more broadly assess the effectiveness or impact of the reforms. Developing such measures and goals and using them to assess the reforms could help the department determine whether they have improved the delivery of the administrative services to support the department's mission and program goals.
TSA conducts covert tests to identify vulnerabilities in its checkpoint and checked baggage screening systems. GAO was asked to review TSA's covert testing program. This report (1) describes how TSA has changed its covert test processes since 2016 and analyzes the extent to which these processes are risk-informed; (2) analyzes how well TSA covert tests for fiscal years 2016 through March 2018 produced quality information; and (3) examines the extent that TSA has used the results of covert testing to address any identified security vulnerabilities. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documentation, interviewed agency officials, and observed covert tests at five airports. The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Transportation Security Officers (TSO) and private sector screeners (collectively referred to as TSOs in this report) perform checkpoint and baggage screening operations at about 440 TSA-regulated (i.e., commercial) airports nationwide. TSA's Transportation Security Inspection (Inspection) and Security Operations (Security Operations) offices conduct covert testing at airports to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in TSA's screening system. For example, in fiscal year 2016, Inspection conducted 280 tests at larger airports to assess whether certain types of assembled explosive devices contained in carry-on luggage could evade detection at the checkpoint. In 2016, TSA redesigned its process for conducting covert tests and began using quantitative methods to design tests and analyze results so that its findings might be applied more broadly across airports. Inspection also documented its new covert test process and rationales for key program decisions, including its approach to performing quantitative analysis of test results, in overarching guidance issued in October 2016. These documents set forth a framework for conducting tests that includes the creation of detailed scenarios that specify Inspection's covert test objectives and scope of testing. However, TSA has not fully documented its rationale for selecting scenarios for covert tests, as called for by DHS and TSA guidance. Such documentation would better enable TSA to demonstrate how it balances its goal of promoting a risk- informed culture, as required by DHS, with program goals to ensure that TSO's are following all required screening procedures correctly. Inspection's new process is designed to produce quality test results and analysis, but Security Operations faces challenges with the quality of its test results. Specifically, Inspection has implemented guidance to ensure a standardized process for developing and executing tests, and has integrated staff with expertise in research and test design, statistics, and systems engineering, among other relevant fields, to analyze this information. Inspection now employs multiple standard practices to ensure test covertness, and GAO observed several of these practices during four tests conducted at one airport. Inspection has also integrated its technical operations team (technical team) into all aspects of test design and data collection and analysis to ensure quality information on screening vulnerabilities. Security Operations' covert test results are used to assess TSO performance, but GAO found that the agency does not analyze all covert test data to identify potential national trends in screener performance that could constitute system-wide vulnerabilities. TSA officials told GAO that they do not have a standard process to comprehensively analyze and report trends in covert test test data across all airports because the intent of the current program has been to make test data available to TSA airport and regional officials so they can identify factors affecting screeners' performance and take actions to remediate and improve any deficiencies. In addition, Security Operations officials cited a lack of resources available to dedicate to this activity, given that headquarters officials have been more focused on revising and improving their current covert test program. TSA airport officials have developed beneficial practices for conducting and using test data, but TSA does not systematically document and disseminate this information to TSA officials at airports. TSA uses covert test information to help address vulnerabilities, but has made limited efforts to implement mitigation activities, analyze results, and share beneficial practices. In 2015, TSA established the Security Vulnerability Management Process to review and address any systemic vulnerability facing TSA, but it is unclear if vulnerabilities reviewed through this process are being addressed in a timely manner because the process lacks clear timeframes and milestones for mitigation steps, as well as an established method for monitoring the achievement of such timeframes. TSA has implemented interim mitigation steps for some vulnerabilities while its program offices develop long-term solutions, but in some cases these vulnerabilities represent systemwide vulnerabilities to commercial aviation that could result in potentially serious consequences for TSA and the traveling public.
The Trust Fund is the federal government's principal source of funding for black lung benefits, which are paid by coal mine operators to eligible employees and retirees. In fiscal year 2016, the Trust Fund was estimated to have a liability of about $1.2 billion, according to the Department of Labor's (DOL) most recent estimates. Coal mine operators are required to self-insure for their black lung benefit liability, but they are also required to commercially insure their federal liabilities to ensure they maintain adequate and continuous coverage as required by law. DOL is responsible for overseeing coal mine operator self- insurance. GAO was asked to testify on its report being released today that examines (1) the extent to which DOL's oversight of coal mine Operator Self-Insurance in the past and in the future has been adequate, (2) the potential risk that uninsured operators could pose to the black lung Trust Fund, and (3) the steps DOL has taken to improve its oversight of the commercial insurance for coal mine Operators. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed DOL policies and procedures, interviewed DOL officials, and reviewed information from eight self-insured and commercially insured coal operators that filed for bankruptcy between 2014 and 2016. In the past, DOL did not have adequate oversight to protect the financial interests of the Coal Mine Operators Trust Fund because it did not regularly review operators to monitor their changing financial conditions or estimate their future benefit liability when setting collateral. For example, in October 2015, for the Patriot Coal (Patriot) bankruptcy, the amount of collateral required from operators did not fully cover their estimated benefit liabilities. When this occurs, benefit liabilities in excess of the collateral can be transferred to the Coal Mining Trust Fund. In July 2019, Dol began implementing a new process for coal Mine operators that may help to address some past deficiencies, if implemented effectively. Among other things, the new process will require operators to periodically submit financial and claims information, including an actuarial estimate of the operator's current and future benefit liabilities, to DOL, which will be used to assess the insolvency risk of each operator. Depending on the results of this analysis, D Labor plans to categorize the risk-level of each applicant as low, medium, or high, and will then set a percentage of the actuarial estimated benefit liability that the operator must secure as collateral to selfinsure. In February 2020, in response to a legislative mandate, DOD officials said they plan to revise these percentages to 100 percent, 85 percent, and 70 percent for high-risk, medium- risk, and low-risk operators, respectively. The Trust Fund's exposure to financial risk has increased in recent years as a result of bankruptcies of coal operators. From 2014 through 2016, three self- insured coal mine operated bankruptcies resulted in a transfer of $865 million of benefit liabilities from the coal operators to the Trust fund, accordingto DOL estimates, and five did not. In June 2019, for example, a coal operator's bankruptcy is expected to transfer $313 million to $325 million in benefit liabilities to the trust fund. In addition, several other selfinsured operators have also filed for bankruptcies since 2016, but DOL does not know how these bankruptcies will affect the trust funds' exposure. In January 2020, however, DOP provided updated estimates stating that $866 million in benefits would transfer to the trustshippers in the bankruptcies. In its review of the Commercial Insurance for Coal Mining Operators Act of 2014 (the Act), GAO found that DOL had not monitored operators that do not self- insure and, thus, must commercially insure to make certain they maintain their federal black lung liabilities to make sure they maintain coverage. Specifically, in examining the 13 largest coal mine operations that do Not Self- Insure: Six operators (parent or subsidiary) were not insured for the entire 3-year period from 2016 through 2018 according to GAO's review of DOL data. When GAO discussed its findings with DOL about these six operators, agency officials had to research each operator individually and in some cases contact the operator or their insurer to find out whether or not they had been covered. However, the insurers had not properly reported the federal black lungs endorsement on new policies or subsequent renewals, in addition to other reporting issues. Without a process to monitor operator compliance with program insurance requirements and periodically evaluate the effectiveness of this process, D
From 1998 to 2018, state and local government expenditures increased from about $1.7 trillion in 1998 to about $2.8 trillion in 2018. State and local governments face fiscal pressures when, taken as a whole, spending exceeds revenues. To alleviate fiscal pressures and comply with balanced budget requirements, governments may seek to reduce spending, increase revenues, or both. GAO was asked to review the fiscal pressures facing state andlocal governments. This report (1) examines recent trends in state andLocal government expenditures and revenues; and (2) synthesizes expert views regarding the effect of federal policy on these fiscal pressures. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis's National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) from 1998 to 2017, the most recent available data for the purpose of examining aggregate state and Local Government Expenditures and Revenues trends; reviewed prior GAO and others' reports on these trends; and interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of experts representing organizations with recognized expertise in fiscal and finance economics, public policy, and intergovernmental issues. In most states, growth in both state and locally government expenditures (i.e., spending and revenues) and revenues exceeded growth in state gross domestic product (GDP) from 1997 to 2017. Spending in most expenditure categories grew faster than or at the same rate as state GDP in a majority of states. For example, spending on public welfare—which includes Medicaid and welfare programs, such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families—grew faster than all other spending categories during this period, on average, at an average annual rate of 4.9 percent per year. Inflation-adjusted spending on education—the largest share of total expenditures—increased by more than $300 billion during the period. However, as a share of overall spending, education expenditures decreased by 2 percentage points, in large part, because of the sizable growth in health expenditures during this time period. Revenue growth was driven by federal grants and user charges. Federal grants were the fastest growing source of revenue for the sector, growing in every state and faster than state GDP (on average) in 45 states. User charges were the second fastest growing revenue source in 40 states and the District of Columbia. State rainy day fund balances fluctuated as a median percentage of general fund expenditures and experienced consistent increases since 2010. Rainy day funds include state budget stabilization or reserve funds that state governments may use to supplement general fund spending during a revenue downturn or other unanticipated shortfall. The median balance of state rainy day funds declined significantly after each of the last two recessions, while states gradually restored their balances each time. Experts GAO interviewed identified a range of federal policies and other considerations that could affect the fiscal condition of state or local governments. Health care, federal budget uncertainty, physical infrastructure, and tax policy were among the issues that emerged most frequently during the interviews related to the sector's fiscal condition, and that could require a federal policy response to ensure effective delivery of federal programs implemented by these governments. Those issues include: health care, the federal budget; physical infrastructure; tax policy; and natural disasters.
The number of AI/AN veterans eligible for both VA and IHS services is unknown. IHS and VA do not have an administrative mechanism for determining the number of these veterans who are users of both systems. Instead, each agency separately relies on individuals to identify either as veterans, or asAI/AN, resulting in different counts. GAO was asked to review issues related to the care of AI and AN veterans. This report examines, among other things, (1) the use of VA's reimbursement agreements with THPs since 2014 and (2) the extent to which VA, IHS, and THP facilities view the agreements as beneficial and any concerns they may have about the agreements. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed VA data and documents related to reimbursement agreements and interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable sample of 15 IHS facilities and 11 THPs selected based on factors such as number of veterans served and number of services provided. The use of reimbursement agreements between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Indian Health Service (IHS) has increased since 2014, as measured by the amount of claims reimbursed and veterans served through them. In fiscal year 2014, VA paid IHS $11.5 million for services provided to AI/ANS veterans, which grew to $20.1 million in fiscal year 2018. This increase mainly represents the growth in reimbursement to THPs—which grew 181 percent, from $4.3 million in 2014 to $12.1 in 2018. VA also reimburses IHS for the costs of prescriptions filled through its Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy program, which provides outpatient prescriptions for AI or AN veterans served at IHS or THPs. In addition, VA reimburses THPs for the cost of certain services provided through its outpatient pharmacy program. The number of IHS-funded and VA-funded services reimbursed by VA each year has increased from about 3,800 to nearly 5,300 from fiscal years 2014 to 2018. Officials from the majority of the 15 facilities GAO contacted said they were generally pleased with the reimbursement agreements, but identified some concerns. For example, officials from one THP noted that the revenue received from their reimbursement agreement freed up other resources that allowed them to hire an additional part-time worker to conduct VA outreach activities. However, officials at a number of facilities said they had concerns about the length of time it took to enter into the agreements and the time frames of the agreements, including the lack of reimbursement for PRC program services. VA officials noted that there is no statutory requirement for them to include the program in the agreements but also identified several other reasons for not including it, including that VA does not want to pay for services externally that it already offers internally and that it would prefer to coordinate the patient's care within VA's existing programs, such as VA's own programs for purchasing care from external providers—like the Veterans Choice Program. VA reports that the process of establishing reimbursement agreements has multiple phases. The process begins with initial communication between the THP and VA, followed by an orientation briefing. The THP then begins to draft the agreement (based on VA's template) and prepare required VA paperwork (e.g., an implementation plan and proof of certification or accreditation). Once drafted, the THPs submits the draft agreement and paperwork for review by VA's IHS/THP Reimbursement Agreements Program. Since GAO's last report in 2014, a joint national leadership team comprised of VA andIHS officials has continued to use quarterly meetings, routine reporting, and MOU goals and measures to oversee MOU implementation and help facilitate collaboration. The leadership team has met to discuss the progress and status of the MOU, develop implementation policy and procedures, create performance measures and timelines, and evaluate progress on those measures. The team also compiles annual reports on progress in MOU Implementation that includes information about activities and challenges on meeting MOU Goals using established measures, and information on the reimbursements and outpatient pharmacy programs. VA and the IHS have improved their efforts to measure progress since 2014 to improve the health care provided to dually eligible AI/ AN veterans, but GAO found that the revised MOU performance measures do not include targets to assess agency progress toward the goals. VA has not considered adding targets to these measures, noting that the nature of the measures and the reimbursement agreement work against establishing targets. Without targets, the agencies are limited in their ability
The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a foreign national or entity as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker to protect the national security and economy of the United States. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for implementing and enforcing the act. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the Kingpin Act. This report examines (1) how U.S. agencies designate individuals and entities under the act; (2) the extent to which agencies monitor, enforce, and report on sanctions; and (3) what agencies have done to assess the effectiveness of the act's implementation. GAOs reviewed documents and interviewed officials from OFAC, partner agencies, and foreign government officials in Washington, D.C., Colombia, Mexico, and Panama. OFAC leads a flexible interagency process to designate foreign narcotics traffickers and their networks, and partner agencies generally find OFAC's guidance sufficient to understand their roles. OFac leads a process generally involving six steps to designate drug trafficking kingpins and their organizations. The six-step process allows OFAC to coordinate its investigations and designations with partner agencies and foreign governments and allows for flexibility in the sequence of steps taken. According to OFAC and partner agency officials, the process is intended to ensure that designations do not jeopardize other agencies' ongoing investigations, OFACs actions are coordinated with other planned civil or criminal actions against each target to maximize the disruption to the drug trafficking organization, and investigators can collect sufficient evidence to designate targets despite targets constantly changing efforts to evade detection. Of the nine cases GAO reviewed, the time from initiation to designation ranged from 6 months to 38 months, and the time spent preparing the evidentiary packages for the cases ranged from 3 months to 31 months. The length of the designation process depends on a number of factors, including how far along other agencies investigations of a target are and how long it takes to gather enough evidence to complete an evidentiary package for a targetwhich may be classified, classified, or compiled from multiple sourcesto determine whether the target meets the criteria for identification or designation and whether there is a network associated with the target. OfAC and its partner agencies have reported on various results related to the imposition of sanctions under the Act, including that they have frozen more than half a billion dollars of sanctioned individuals or entities assets and that the sanctions have assisted law enforcement agencies in their investigations of drug trafficking organizations. For example, in one case, a federal grand jury indicted Raul Flores Hernandezthe suspected leader of a Guadalajara-based drug trafficking groupin August 2017 for moving large quantities of cocaine from South America to Mexico for distribution and further transportation into the UnitedStates. In October 2018, as part of a joint investigation, DEA and OFAC designated him (as well as 21 of his alleged criminal associates and 42 businesses and other entities affiliated with his drug trafficking network) and other individuals under the Kingpins Act concurrent with the indictment. OF AC and its partners reported that sharing information about Flores Hernandez was essential to both the designations and the indictment, and that disrupting the access of significant narcotics traffickers networks to the financial system has been helpful in motivating several designees to cooperate with law enforcement investigations. In some cases, designations have had unintended consequences for foreign persons other than those targeted by the sanctions, such as allowing foreign banks to terminate accounts of, and deny service to, designees because of the risk the banks would face if they continued those business relationships. The Departments of State and Defense and the Federal Bureau of Investigationalong with the Federal Reserve and the Drug Enforcement Administrationhave denied visas and blocked access to designees property as non-financial consequences of the Act. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has met the annual requirement to report to Congress on agencies’ personnel and resources expended on the imposition and monitoring of Kingpin act sanctions, but provided limited guidance to partner agencies on what expenditure data to report. As such, GAO observed considerable inconsistencies in resource expenditures reported by agencies and determined that methods for determining expenditures varied by agency. Moreover, OFac does not disclose agency data limitations, including why the data may vary from year to year, before reporting the information to Congress. Without consistent agency data and disclosure of data limitations regarding information on
The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is a self-sustaining, business-like entity with a mission of providing universal postal service. However, USPS's financial condition has worsened in recent years due to declining mail volume, increased compensation and benefits costs, and increased unfunded liabilities and debt. USPS has not made $55.4 billion in required payments to fund its retiree health and pension benefits through fiscal year 2019, including $47.2 billion in missed payments since fiscal year 2010, and $8.2billion for funding pension benefits since 2014. In addition, USPS had been at its statutory debt limit of $15 billion for many years; however, it has begun paying down this debt, leaving a balance of $11 billion at the end of fiscal year2019. GAO was asked to review USPS's business model. This report examines (1) the key challenges that USPS faces in its current business model, (2) actions taken to address these challenges, and (3) the challenges that remain. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and other documents; analyzed USPS financial data; and interviewed USPS and Postal Regulatory Commission officials in the United States, Germany, France, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. USPS's current businessmodel is not financially sustainable due to three key challenges. Declining mail volume. First-Class Mail—USPS's most profitable class of mail—has declined 44 percent since 2006, the year that total mail volume peaked. USPS marketing mail—which comprises most other mail volume—declined 27 percent from fiscal years 2007 to 2019, in part due to electronic advertising alternatives. The volume of USPS competitive products more than tripled since 2007. This volume, however, began to decline in the second half of 2019 due to growing competition for package delivery. Increased compensation and benefit costs. While USPS reduced its total workforce (career and non-career employees) from 785,900 in fiscal year 2007, to 617,700 in FY 2013, its workforce increased to about 630,000 in FY 2019. Although USPS has implemented changes to help control these costs, such as lowering pay for new career employees and increasing the use of non-Career employees, these efforts have been limited by stakeholder opposition and statutory requirements. For example, USPS is required to provide 6-days-a-week delivery and to operate postal facilities across the country. Federal law also requires USPS to provide the maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-Sustaining. Federal laws also limit USPS's ability to close retail facilities and limit its ability to change the postal services it provides. USPS is also limited by a price cap on market-dominant products that generally limits rate increases for these products to a common measure of inflation. USPS also is prohibited from providing new nonpostal products and services, which could affect its efforts to increase revenues. USPS faces difficult choices in fundamentally reassessing the three critical foundational elements of its business model—level of universal postal services, financial sustainability, and institutional structure. These choices are likely to require changes in laws and will have differing effects on postal stakeholders. While the specific impacts will depend on the changes made, some or all of USPS's stakeholders could be affected and these impacts should be considered as part of any reassessment. All three key areas are interrelated, and significant changes in one area may affect another. While GAO has testified that Congress faces a tradeoff between the level of postal services the nation needs and the levels of postal service the nation is willing to pay for, there is no consensus on what level of service the country needs. USPS and others have proposed reducing the frequency of delivery, but no legislation has been enacted that would allow USPS to do so.
NNSA's ability to produce unique microelectronics for nuclear weapons is essential to ensuring a credible U.S. nuclear deterrent. GAO was asked to review NNSA's efforts to recapitalize its microelectronic capability. This report examines (1) the extent to which NNSA has taken actions over the past decade to sustain its current and future capabilities for producing microelect Electronics at Sandia and (2) NNSA plans to upgrade and sustain its existing and planned capabilities for the next 20 years. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed NNSA documents and interviewed NNSA and Sandia contractor officials. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) completed several actions to sustain operations at its existing strategic radiation-hardened microelect electronics facilities at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) through 2025 while simultaneously identifying future alternatives for its future capability beyond 2025. In particular, during fiscal years 2012 through 2019, NNSA engaged in a $150 million effort to sustain the operations of its Strategic Radiation-Hardened Microelectronics Fabrication Facility (SiFab Facility) atSandia through 2025. NNSA spent about $27 million to complete approximately 25 infrastructure projects at the facility, including replacing aging equipment and refurbishing existing equipment and purchasing new equipment that is more automated and is intended to increase process reliability. While NNSA was working with Sandia to sustain this facility through 2025, the agency also began identifying and evaluating options for producingmicroelectronics after 2025, such as constructing a new multibillion-dollar production facility. However, because of changes to key assumptions, in November 2018 NNSA decided not to pursue any of the identified alternatives and instead stated that the agency was going to assess options for sustaining its current capability at SandIA beyond 2025, which is estimated to cost about $1 billion over 20 years, or about $45 million a year, through 2040. In addition, in February 2020 NNSA is in preliminary discussions with the Department of Defense (DOD) to determine if NNSA could make additional investments in this same facility to potentially produce strategic radiation hardened microElectronics for integration into nuclear weapons, according to NNSA officials. In January 2019, the Senate Armed Services Committee report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to review the agency's ongoing approach to managing its micro Electronically Engineered Small Engineered Powerplant (LEP) program, which includes developing and producing microElectronic Powerplant components for nuclear weapon modernization programs. This testimony is based on GAO's review of NNSA documentation and interviews with officials from NNSA, Sandia, DOD, and other federal entities. The Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Safety and Security Administration has made three key decisions in 2019 related to upgrading and sustaining its existing microelectronically engineered powerplant capability at the Sandia MESA Complex (MESA Complex) at NASA's National Ignition Facility in Nevada. First, in January 2019 NNSA approved plans to further upgrade its process for producingMicroelectronics. Second, in March 2019, in response to a Senate committee report accompanying an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2019 for DOD, the Secretary of Defense approved a plan to identify, prioritize, and provide budget estimates to sustain Sandia's infrastructure and equipment at the MESA complex for 20 years (FY2020 through FY2040). Third, in October 2019, DOD announced that it had awarded a contract to a U. S.-owned-and-operated microelectronscope commercial production facility to, among other things, enhance its radiation- Hardened MicroElectronics production process for systems (such as satellites) that operate in environments with increased radiation levels. In February 2020, DOD and NNSA are in preliminary talks to determine whether NNSA should make an additional investment in this facility to produce nuclear weapons-related microelectrones. In November 2019, as part of a revised management approach to manage its micro electronicallyengineered powerplant and other activities, N NSA is starting to implement a new full-time coordinator position to help guide certain aspects of these activities, including developing a mission need statement and a requirements document, but this approach does not fully incorporate key management controls. For example, while some in NNSA have recognized the need to coordinate these activities to effectively carry them out and meet specific goals by specific dates, agency leadership has not fully developed controls
During the fiscal year 2019 government shutdown, which began on December 22, 2018, most federal employees were furloughed. GAO was asked to review agencies' planning for a potential prolonged shutdown. This report assesses the extent to which (1) selected agencies' contingency plans were consistent with applicable OMB guidance, (2) selected agency components planned for a prolonged shutdown and changed operations during the shutdown, and (3) agency components' shutdown policies and procedures were consistently consistent with relevant internal control principles. To conduct this review, GAO selected four agency components—U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the International Trade Administration (ITA), the Department of Commerce (Commerce), and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). GAO reviewed agency contingency plans and other planning documents and interviewed agency officials. Three of the four agencies reviewed—CBP, IRS, ITA, and USTR—had detailed contingency plans for the potential shutdown of their operations. However, none of these agencies' plans addressed all elements specified in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance for preparing for and documenting operations during a potential shutdown. OMB's Circular A-11 directs agencies to prepare contingency plans in anticipation of a lapse in appropriations. These plans are key documents that help ensure an orderly shutdown and continuity of appropriate agency operations following a lapse of appropriations, as well as communication of agency operations and policies to employees and external stakeholders that could be affected by the shutdown of operations. According to OMB officials, OMB reviews these plans, but it does not formally approve them. Agencies are ultimately responsible for determining which activities will continue and those that will cease during a shutdown and how they will be carried out. Using OMB Circular a-11 and other key information elements as criteria, three of four selected agencies provided summary information at the beginning of their contingency plans about activities that would and would not continue during a government shutdown. For example, CBP's contingency plan included the total number of employees on-board before the shutdown and the number that would continue to work during the government shutdown; however, EOP's plan did not break down these employees by disability exception categories that may include addressing emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property or carrying out core constitutional powers. While the break out of employees by ADA exception categories was not in the DHS department-wide plan, CBC's component-level portion of the plan contained these details. The fourth agency component—ITA—planned for potential operational changes in the event of a prolonged government shutdown but did not document these changes in its contingency plan. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) did not have a contingency plan for the federal government shutdown and did not provide documentation of its shutdown planning processes, which would help ensure that officials take the necessary steps to effectively prepare for future potential government shutdowns. IRS and ITA planned for potential changes to their operations, but CBP did not. IRS officials said they knew about operational changes at the time of initial shutdown planning, but had not documented all of these operational needs. ITA officials said that they used a "bottom-up" shutdown planning process to identify activities to continue, as part of this process, before submitting plans to General Counsel for review, but ITA did not develop a plan to document these roles and responsibilities because the agency relied on the processes documented in Commerce's plan, which did not contain information about component-specific actions to take in the planning process. USTR officials told GAO that they relied on institutional knowledge to carry out their recall procedures for furloughs, but they did not documented these processes. Documentation of employee recall processes would help USTR ensure that they effectively implement these processes during future shutdowns, especially given that officials who previously implemented shutdown-related processes may not be available during future government shutdowns. All of the agency components reviewed or planned to review their shutdown processes and incorporate any identified solutions into their internal planning documents or into agency contingency planning. Three agency components generally tracked employees working but had insufficient controls to limit their access to physical and virtual workspaces during the Shutdown. IRS did not limit employees' access to its workspaces, and CBP had limited controls to prevent employees from accessing its networks or devices during theshutdown.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) of 2003 established the Part D program, which is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The MMA requires GAO to review drug benefit management services provided by PBMs to Part D plan sponsors. GAO was asked to review these services. This report examines (1) the extent to which plan sponsors contract with PBMs, (2) how PBMs earn revenue from the services they provide to plan sponsors, (3) trends in rebates and other price concessions obtained by plan sponsors and PBMs from manufacturers and others for Part D drugs, and (4) how Part D drug prices are discounted off of manufacturer list prices. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed CMS data, reviewed relevant literature, and interviewed officials from CMS, drug manufacturers, and other stakeholders. In 2016, a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) was used to provide nearly all of the 10 key drug benefits management services under 624 Part D sponsor contracts, and use was concentrated among five PBMs. Seventy-four percent of these services were provided by a PBM alone or in conjunction with a plan sponsor, while plan sponsors performed the remaining 26 percent themselves. In addition, a majority of PBMs that provided these services also received rebates from manufacturers. Rebates are payments from manufacturers that are passed on to PartD plan sponsors to help offset the cost of prescription drugs for beneficiaries. According to data reported to CMS in 2016, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's analysis, PBMs passed through nearly all rebates received from manufacturers through to plans in 2016. The amount of rebates obtained for brand-name and generic drugs from manufacturers outpaced growth in gross and net Part D expenditures for these drugs from 2014 through 2016, according to GAO analysis of CMS data. The highest expenditure, highest utilization brand- name drugs accounted for 65 percent of the $145 billion in Part D spending in 2016 and received the vast majority of the rebates. Brand-name drugs generally had higher percent changes in rebate and other prices concessions and in net and gross expenditures than did generics. In contrast, the 200 highest utilization and 200 highest expenditure generic drugs had relatively low gross expenditures, rebates, and utilization compared with the other two groups. Increases in expenditures for the three groups of drugs in our analysis were primarily accounted for by increases in the price per drug rather than changes in utilization, as indicated by the growth in expenditures exceeded growth in their utilization. Part D prescription drug prices were significantly lower than list prices for drugs sold in retail pharmacies in 2016 than those sold in specialty pharmacies. For these drugs, gross Part D prices—those paid to the pharmacy and paid to PBMs on the plan sponsor's behalf, and the beneficiary—were 17 percent lower than manufacturer list Prices for brand name drugs in 2016 when rebates were accounted for, 41 percent lower when they were not, and 16 percent lower for generic drugs. The percentage of Part D beneficiaries who received a drug that was priced below the manufacturer list price in 2016 for the 444 highest expenditure and 476 highest utilization brands in 2016 ranged from 0.5 to 70.5 percent.
In September 2018, the White House released the National Biodefense Strategy and associated plans to help ensure the nation's biodefense capabilities are adequately prepared to respond to biological threats. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the Strategy. This report assesses the extent to which the Strategy and its associated plans incorporated the elements listed in the NDAA. To do so, GAO reviewed the Strategy, its implementation plan, and related documents, and interviewed officials from eight federal agencies, selected to reflect a range of roles and responsibilities, as well as officials from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Security Council (NSC). GAO also interviewed OMB staff and officials from HHS, the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Homeland Security, and State, and Veterans Affairs, and the Environmental Protection Agency. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other participating federal agencies have taken steps to implement a new approach to biodefence that is consistent with GAO's national strategy criteria and leading practices for interagency collaboration, but additional steps are needed to ensure the Strategy's success. The Strategy and related plans are designed to support an enterprise-wide approach to managing risk across the federal government. However, challenges with planning, limited guidance and capabilities, and lack of clarity about decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities could limit the success of the strategy's implementation. In the first year of implementation, agencies have faced challenges in identifying and sharing information on their biodefensive programs, projects, and activities. For example, agencies did not have the personnel and expertise needed to complete the initial data collection effort, and some agencies had to bring in non-biodefence personnel--including from the comptroller's office--to identify programs and resources to complete this effort. Agency officials noted that the process for the identification of resources and activities could be “transformational,” but said that it will take time to get right. In addition, while agencies are currently assessing the activities and challenges of the early years, HHS has not worked with the other agencies to establish feedback and monitoring mechanisms or processes that can help identify implementation challenges and develop solutions to address those challenges, particularly early implementation issues that might threaten the efficacy of the effort if they are institutionalized going forward. The strategy implementation efforts lack clear procedures and planning to ensure that the data collected will be analyzed in a way that leads to recognition of meaningful opportunities to leverage resources. In particular, HHS (1) has not documented guidance and methods for analyzing the data, including but not limited to methods and guidance for how to account for the contribution of nonfederal capabilities; and (2) does not have a resource plan for staffing and sustaining ongoing efforts. Further, the governing bodies overseeing the Strategys implementationHHS and OMBdid not clearly document key components of the assessment process and roles for joint decision making, which raises questions about how these bodies will move from an effort to catalog all existing activities to decisionmaking that accounts for enterprisewide needs and opportunities. As of the date of GAO’s briefing in March 2019, agencies continued to develop additional key components, such as metrics, milestones, and end states, but had not yet completed them. As GAO has previously reported, these documents had not received NSC staff approval as the process to finalize them is considered ongoing, which could lead to inefficiencies and delay effective implementation.
The Navy's readiness recovery is premised on the adherence to set deployment, training, and maintenance schedules. However, GAO reported in May 2016 on the difficulty that both the public and private shipyards were having in completing maintenance on time. GAO found that, from 2011 through 2014, about 72 percent of scheduled maintenance for surface combatants, and 89 percent of maintenance for aircraft carriers, was completed late. The Navy is seeking to grow the fleet over the next 15 years, but if it increases the size of the fleet before addressing its maintenance challenges, it is likely that the Navy will be faced with a growing number of both maintenance delays and ships that are unavailable for use. This testimony discusses (1) persistent and substantial maintenance delays for ships and submarines, (2) factors that contribute to these delays, and (3) the extent to which the Navy has taken corrective actions to address these delays. This statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from May 2015 through December 2018, along with selected updates conducted in November 2019 on the status of the Navy's efforts to address GAO's prior recommendations. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Navy continue to face significant challenges in maintaining their current fleet and reaping the full benefit of the ships it has in its inventory today due to persistent and significant maintenance delays. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force face similar challenges in their ability to successfully maintain their ships—completing all required maintenance on-time and within estimated cost. For example, the Navy was unable to complete scheduled ship maintenance about 75 percent of the time during fiscal years 2014 through 2019, which equates to about 33,700 days of delays. Furthermore, these delays have been growing longer and more frequent. In fiscal year 2019, more than 57 percent of its maintenance periods were similarly late. When maintenance is not completed on time, there are two primary effects. First, fewer ships are available to conduct training or operations, which can hinder readiness. Second, maintenance delays are costly, resulting in the Navy losing the equivalent of 19 surface ships in fiscal year2019. In November 2018, we examined attack submarine maintenance delays, estimated that from 2008 to 2018 the Navy spent $1.5 billion to support attack submarines that provided no operational capability—attack submarines sitting idle no longer certified to conduct normal operations—while waiting to enter the shipyards and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyard. We recommended that the Army analyze how it allocates its maintenance workload. DOD concurred with our recommendation, and in December 2018 the Army and Navy analyzed its workload allocation and moved two additional attack submarines maintenance availabilities to the private shipyard, with the possibility of moving additional availabilities over thenext 5 years. In addition, we have ongoing work on the effect that acquisition decisions can have on maintenance that GAO expects to issue in early 2020. In our prior work, we identified numerous challenges that occur during the maintenance planning and execution of a ship's maintenance period that can contribute to delays, including difficulties in adhering to the planning process, shortages of skilled personnel, and poor condition of facilities and equipment, among other factors. In February 2019, we reported that the naval shipyards cannot support 68 of the 218—almost a third—of the maintenance periods that aircraft carriers and submarines will require through 2040, due to a lack of dry dock capacity. We also found that no dry docks can currently support repairs to the Ford class aircraft carrier, even though the Navy accepted delivery of the first ship of that class in 2017. Private shipyards have told the Navy that they could have some additional capacity to conduct maintenance, but are hesitant to invest in creating this capacity without more certainty from the Navy. In response to our recommendations to the Navy to improve its shipyard operations, it has begun to implement a major effort—the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan—that is intended to significantly improve the condition of shipyard facilities and Equipment, but it will require significant time and resources to implement. This plan is designed to address the bulk of the Army's dry-dock capacity issues as well as identify the optimal placement of facilities at each public shipyard and can ultimately increase its maintenance efficiency by reducing the distance that workers and material will have to travel around shipyards during maintenance. In August 2018, the Army reported that this effort will require $21 billion over 20 years to implement, but this estimate does not include inflation and other significant costs, such as those for
 Drawback refunds are a remittance of up to 99 percent of duties, taxes, or fees previously paid by an importer on imported goods on which the importer previously paid duties and subsequently exported from the United States or destroyed. Under the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) drawback program, CBP disburses about $1 billion in drawback refunds per year. In February 2018, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) enacted TFTEA, which amended the drawback statute and required CBP to modernize the program. CBP issued the Modernized Drawback Final Rule in December 2018. GAO was asked to review the modernization of the drawback program. This report examines (1) the extent to which modernization affects drawback refund eligibility and CBP's management of its workload, as well as the extent that CBP has (2) taken steps to address risks of improper payments in the program and (3) analyzed the impact of the changes to the program on industry and government. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed statutory, regulatory, and agency drawback documents and interviewed CBP officials and a non-generalizable sample of 15 industry representatives from a variety of sectors. The Department of Homeland Security's (Pursuant to the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) generally expanded eligibility for drawback refunds, with some caveats, but CBP is not adequately managing its growing workload of claims resulting from the changes. The substitution standard for drawback claims generally allowed more merchandise to potentially qualify for refund refunds, but it also limited the eligibility of certain broadly categorized merchandise. For example, under the new substitution standard, both the imported merchandise and the substituted merchandise generally must match at the 8-digit or 10-digit HTS classification to be eligible for drawback refund refunds. The standard also expanded the scope of the refund of taxes and fees for manufacturing claims and standardized time limits to file claims. On balance, these changes, along with certain limitations in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), have led to an increase in the workload of drawback specialists. However, CBC did not anticipate the increased workload and does not have a plan to manage its increased workload, which has caused delays resulting in uncertainty for industry--potentially impeding trade. The workload of the Drawback Centers is growing because of a learning curve related to the switch from a paper-based to an electronic process, delays in processing claims, and an increased number of claims. Further, drawback specialists continue to face staffing shortages. Federal standards for internal control call for agency management to evaluate and hold individuals accountable for their internal control responsibilities, which include evaluating pressure on personnel to help personnel fulfill their assigned responsibilities in accordance with the entity's standards of conduct. Management can adjust excessive pressures using many different tools, such as rebalancing workloads or increasing resource levels. Until CBP develops a plan for managing its increase in workload, it risks further delays in drawback claim processing that result in uncertainty, which runs counter to its strategic goal of enabling lawful trade and travel and streamlining and unifying processes and procedures. The drawback program has not addressed several other risks for improper payments related to export information, including the lack of a reliable system of record for proof of export and a lack of targeting a selection of claims for review. As a result, the program remains at risk of improper payment of over $2 billion in un-reviewed claims for export-related refunds, which could result in millions of dollars in additional revenue loss to the federal government. Prior to modernization, CBp was not able to produce a reliable assessment of the economic impact of changes to drawback eligibility because of data limitations and other factors. CBC has not prioritized developing a plan with time frames to conduct such an analysis. Without such a plan, CBPs cannot be certain about the economic impacts of drawback modernization.
Trauma or adverse childhood experiences may include physical and sexual abuse, neglect, bullying, community-based violence, extreme poverty, the loss of a parent or primary caretaker, or natural disasters, among other things. These experiences may overwhelm a child's natural ability to cope and can cause stress reactions in children, including feelings of intense fear, terror, and helplessness. When children are exposed to chronic stressful events, their neurodevelopment can be disrupted, and as a result, their cognitive functioning may be impaired, causing long-term harm to their physical, social, and emotional well-being. Child welfare experts generally believe that child welfare systems that use trauma-informed approaches are better able to address children's safety, permanency, and well- Being needs. GAO was asked to review efforts to support children affected by trauma. This report examines (1) how the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Education (Education) support state and local child welfare and education agencies' efforts to address childhood trauma, and (2) the extent to which selected states have taken steps to support these children. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal and state laws, regulations, guidance, and other documents; interviewed officials in six states selected based on geographic diversity and other factors; and interviewed federal, state, and local officials. HHS and Education provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. HHS provides grants, disseminates information, and funds training and technical assistance to help states and local agencies support children Affected by Trauma. From 2011 to 2013, HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) awarded about $58 million in discretionary grants to states and other organizations to address trauma, including two state child welfare agencies and a county agency in five of the six states GAO selected to review. The grants were used to screen and refer children to treatment, implement or expand trauma-focused, evidence-based treatments, and bridge the gap between mental health and child welfare. The last of these grants will end in September 2019. In addition, SAMHSA awarded $48 million in fiscal year 2017 for the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), a collaborative network of experts that conducts research on trauma treatment approaches and provides services to children. In four of the selected states, officials reported using the NCTSN's Child Welfare Trauma Training Toolkit curriculum to train their staff. The curriculum, designed to be completed in about 13 hours, covers topics such as the impact of trauma on the brain and body and the identification of trauma-related needs of children and families. Also, in three of these states, child welfare officials told GAO that they use the Resource Parent Curriculum to train foster parents and others about trauma and the Think Trauma curriculum to prepare trainers of group home and residential center staff. Officials in all six selected states reported that they have taken a variety of approaches to help staff understand trauma and its effects on children, identify children affected, and provide support to them. These approaches range from training child welfare workers, educators, and clinicians to screening children for symptoms caused by traumatic experiences. They also include developing support systems, including providing services, to children and their families who need more help. While GAO did not evaluate the effectiveness of these state and county initiatives, many of them incorporate key trauma principles and activities cited in the SAMhSA framework above. For example, one state's child welfare agency used a learning community approach—which included face-to-face training, as well as coaching and practice, over an extended period—to work with child welfare staff in 32 of the state's 100 counties, according to a state official. In three states, education officials said that schools have developed processes to identify students who may have experienced trauma, such as developing school-based teams to identify at-risk students and developing partnerships to provide mental health services to these students. Officials from all six states said that leadership is important in establishing and sustaining support for children affected By Trauma in the child welfare system, and officials in three states described instances in which a lack of leadership hindered the implementation of trauma initiatives. Officials also reported limitations on their agency's or organization's capacity to support trauma initiatives, including high rates of staff turnover, limited staff time to focus on trauma, insufficient numbers of clinicians trained in trauma-specific therapies, and insufficient funding. Some agencies and
The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) within the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for protecting federal employees and applicants from prohibited personnel practices, especially reprisal for whistleblowing. OSC reviews disclosures of wrongdoing within the federal government from current federal employees, former employees, and applicants for federal employment. These individuals, known as whistleblowers, make disclosures of alleged wrongdoing to OSC that the employee reasonably believes evidences either (1) a violation of law, rule, or regulation; (2) gross mismanagement; (3) gross waste of funds; (4) abuse of authority; (5) a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; or (6) censorship related to research, analysis, or technical information. If a whistleblower believes his or her agency took, threatened to take, or did not take a personnel action because of a protected disclosure, the whistleblower may file a retaliation complaint with OSC. Whistleblower disclosures and retaliation complaints can result in termination of federal employees. GAO was asked to review federal employee whistleblower protections. This report examines the extent to which employees who file a whistleblower disclosure or retaliation complaint are in a probationary status, the extent that these filings are associated with differences in termination rates, and OSC's procedures related to probationary employees. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed OSC data from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, reviewed OSC documents, and interviewed OSC officials. GA OSC does not require federal employees to identify on their complaint forms whether they are probationary or permanent employees. Probationary employees, by definition, are relatively new to their positions and are thus uniquely vulnerable to retaliation from employers due to the limited protections afforded them. The average annual total of probationary and permanent federal employees was approximately 1.9 million in fiscal year 2014, and GAO estimates that probationary federal employees filed between 6.6 percent and 18.2 percent of whistleblower disclosures, whistleblower retaliation complaints, or both over this 5-year period. During the same time period, 14,043 employees—about 0.15 percent of the federal workforce—filed complaints each year. Overall, OSC termination rates for employees who filed whistleblower disclosures or retaliation complaints were higher than those for employees government-wide who did not. For example, in 2018, the lowest estimated minimum rate (minimum) of termination for probationaries who filed was 10.1 percent, compared to the overall 1 percent termination rate for all probationaries. The lowest minimum rate of termination was 7.8 percent for those who filed retaliation complaints. The maximum estimated minimum termination rate was 0.3 percent for all permanent employees, regardless of whether they filed a complaint. The higher rates of termination generally, and the higher estimated rates for probationary workers who filed, suggest a potential relationship between filing and terminations that may disproportionately impact probationary individuals. O SC has roles and responsibilities related to understanding key trends and challenges for whistleblowers, and could potentially further investigate whether these differences indicate a particular risk for these employees. However, they are not collecting data on probationary employment status that would enable them to do so. Without consistent data on the status of all employees filing whistleblower disclosures and complaints of retaliation, O SC cannot have reasonable assurance that it is adequately identifying trends or challenges.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) relies on its electronic health record (EHR) system--VistA--to document the delivery of health care services to veterans. VA's EHRM program is intended to result in a more modern EHR system that would improve providers' ability to deliver care, and share health data, including between VA and the Department of Defense (DOD). In June 2017, the VA Secretary announced that the department planned to acquire and configure the same system that DOD is currently implementing across the military health system. GAO was asked to review VA's implementation of the EHR. This report examines (1) VA's progress in making system configuration decisions for the Cerner EHR and (2) the extent to which VA's decision-making procedures for EHR councils were effective and included key stakeholders. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed VA EHR program documents and interviewed VA and DOD officials. VA met its schedule for making EHR configuration decisions and has formulated a schedule for the remaining EHR systems configuration decisions before implementing the system at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in the fall of 2020. In addition, VA has established EHR council decisionmaking procedures that were generally effective. For example, the program established 18 councils, based upon specific clinical and administrative areas, to make VA-specific configuration decisions. These councils included subject-matter experts from VA, such as health care providers in various clinical areas and other staff, as well as non-VA participants from DOD and Cerner. The councils also included a wide range of stakeholders, in terms of geographic representation and representation from VA central office, VISNs, and medical facilities. However, VA did not always ensure adequate representation at local workshops. Specifically, local workshop participants at the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington, and the Veterans Integrated Health System in Seattle, Wash., in September and October 2019 raised concerns that VA's program did not include all relevant stakeholders, including clinicians and staff, at local workshop meetings. VA officials said that they had not included certain specialists and scheduled workshops on specialty areas as they decided to focus first on more foundational decisions. VA plans to continue to hold local workshops in advance of system implementation at future VA medical facilities to focus on site-specific decisions. In October 2019, VA met the schedule it had established for making initial system configuration decisionmaking for capability set 1, which was scheduled for initial implementation in July 2020. VA also met VA's goal to make at least 70 percent of the decisions needed by October 18, 2019, to implement capability set 2, which is scheduled for implementation at the Puget sound health care system in fall 2020. According to VA, this schedule will allow time for Cerner to develop and establish a more complete and robust training environment, as requested by VHA clinicians and other facility staff, and to develop additional interfaces between the system and other VA systems. In April 2020, VA shifted priorities to focus its efforts on caring for veterans in response to the pandemic created by the Coronavirus Disease 2019.
Dual-eligible beneficiaries qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, and may enroll in and receive benefits covered by each program. GAO was asked to review states' efforts to encourage aligned enrollment. In states with MLTSS, a dual-eligible beneficiary may be able to enroll in a D-SNP and a Medicaid MCO that are offered by the same or related companies, an arrangement known as aligned enrollment, in which the same company or related company provides Medicare benefits, such as primary and acute care, and Medicaid benefits,such as long-term services and supports, through a MCO. State Medicaid agencies enter into contracts with both D- SNPs and MCOs, and these contracts may include provisions to facilitate and encourage aligned enrollments. CMS has a direct role with one aspect of aligned enrollment: default enrollment, which allows states to automatically assign certain beneficiaries to D-NSPs that are aligned with a Medicaid managed care organization, a process known as default enrollment. This process can directly increase the number of dual- eligible beneficiaries with aligned enrollment and may result in better coordination of care for these beneficiaries. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2017 included a provision for GAO to review aligned enrollment in D-SNPs. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have implemented approaches to encourage aligning enrollment, (2) the challenges states have faced in implementing and evaluating aligned enrollment policies, and (3) CMS's efforts to assist states in implementing these approaches. To do this work, GAO selected seven states—Arizona, Florida, Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania—based on factors such as population size, Medicaid enrollment, and geographic location—and interviewed CMS officials. As of July 2019, of the 19 states with Medicare-Medicaid managed care plans and where aligned enrollment of dual eligible beneficiaries in these plans is possible, 16 have implemented at least one of the five approaches identified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Integrated Care Resource Center. Of those 16 states, 11 managed which plans operate in the state, which is the foundation for promoting aligned enrollment (see fig.). The three most common approaches among GAO's selected states were managing which plans operated in a state; limiting plans' enrollment to full-benefit, dual- eligibly beneficiaries; and encouraging D-NickelsSNPs' marketing to better support informed beneficiary decision-making. The details of the approaches implemented in each state varied widely. For example, five of the seven selected states managed which D-snPs operated in 2019, but they varied in how they implemented this approach. As a result of the selected states' differing approaches, the proportion of aligned to unaligned D-savings plan (D-SNp) enrollees varied from 20 percent in Pennsylvania to 100 percent in New Jersey among the seven states that were able to provide data for 2019. Medicaid officials in selected states described various challenges with aligning enrollees. The most common challenge mentioned was difficulty using data to implement and evaluate aligned enrollment policy changes. These challenges include challenges with obtaining the data needed to evaluate the health benefits of aligned enrollees and challenges with ensuring that beneficiaries receive quality information about their Medicare enrollment choices. CMS officials told GAO that the agency has provided technical assistance to states on implementing the various approaches that encourage alignedrollment, but lacks quality information on the experience of beneficiaries whose aligned enrollment was due to default enrollment and who then disenroll from a health plan after they are default enrolled. CMS's monthly reports on default enrollment do not include data on beneficiaries who choose todisenroll after being default enrolled, and GAO found that CMS does not have quality data on the experiences of beneficiaries who have disenrolled after they have been default enrolled for various reasons. Quality information would allow CMS to better identify the extent of challenges these beneficiaries face and to determine how, if at all, to address those challenges.
SSA administers the nation's largest disability benefit program, the Disability Insurance (DI) program, which provides financial assistance to individuals who are unable to work due to qualifying impairments. Prescription opioids are used to treat many of these impairments, including pain, and have been linked to an increasing number of opioid prescriptions. GAO was asked to review the relationship between opioid prescriptions and DI claims. This report examines (1) what is known about trends in prescription opioids and (2) how SSA considers potential prescription opioid misuse in its DI eligibility decisions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and SSA on opioid prescriptions, DI claims, and other factors from 2010 through 2017, the most recent year for which data were available at the time of GAO's review; reviewed a non-probability sample of 30 case files for DI beneficiaries identified as being at risk of opioid misuse or abuse in 2017; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies; and interviewed SSA headquarters officials and staff in six offices in Alabama, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Opioid prescriptions and disability claims have declined in recent years, but few studies or data sources provide information on the relationship. Nationwide data show that trends in opioid prescriptions have followed a similar pattern, with both peaking between 2010 and 2014 and then declining. From 2006 to 2017, total opioid prescriptions peaked at about 255 million prescriptions in 2012, and then decreased in each of the following years. Similarly, the number of DI claims peaked at a maximum of about 1.1 million claims in 2014 and has steadily declined since. However, few studies and data sources have examined the relationships between these trends. For example, two studies funded by the Social Security Administration (SSA) found a positive correlation between prescription opioid use and disability, but noted that additional data and analysis are needed to refine the results. In addition to funding research, SSA collects some administrative data on substance use among DI claimants, including use of prescription opioids, but these data have limitations for analyzing opioid use. Specifically, these data may be incomplete because claimants may not report all substances they use. Further, researchers working on a study funded by SSA said analyzing these data is challenging because many claimants manually enter the names of their medications into an optional free-text field on their electronic applications rather than selecting from a dropdown menu, and that these entries often include misspellings or alternative names. Given the limitations with the claimant-level data GAO reviewed, its county-level analysis shows wide variation in rates of opioid prescription and DI claim rates, and geographic differences by geographic region. In 2017, opioid prescriptions ranged from nearly 0 to 396 opioid prescriptions per 100 people per year across all counties, while DI claims ranged from 0 to 16.4 DI claims per 1,000 people. Most counties, however, were clustered around the median of 65 opioid prescriptions for 100 people and 3.7 DI claims for 1,00 people in 2017. In examining counties with the highest rates of both prescriptions and claims (i.e., counties in the top third of the distributions for each rate), GAO found that those with highest rates were generally concentrated in the Southeast. For the 10-year period GAO examined (2010 through 2017), rates of prescription opioid prescriptions were positively correlated with rates of DI claim allowances, and these rates were also correlated with other factors, such as poverty and access to health insurance. GAE was unable to determine whether there is a causal relationship between rates of prescriptions and rates of claims, but did find a significantly positive correlation in the regression analyses GAO conducted on these data, on average, from 2010 to 2017. SSA's policies require staff to deny DI benefits to claimants if substance use disorders (including opioids not taken as prescribed) are “material” to the impairments that preclude the claimant from work, but Substance Use Disorder evaluations are seldom the key factor in denying benefits, according to SSA data and program staff. In some cases, staff told GAO they were confused about when to conduct a DAA evaluation, which is required when a substance use disorder is considered a medically determinable impairment as defined by the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and documented by an acceptable medical source. In the 15 case files in which SSA had conducted an evaluation, nine did not include a documented rationale for why
EXIM's financing products include direct loans, loan guarantees, export-credit insurance, and working capital guarantees to support U.S. exports. GAO was asked to review fraud risks associated with EXIM financing products. This report examines (1) the extent to which EXIM has identified and mitigated fraud risks related to its financing products and (2) how EXIM detects delinquent federal debt owed by applicants and participants. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed EXIM documents and interviewed EXIM officials, reviewed 44 adjudicated cases of fraud adjudicated from calendar years 2012 through 2017, and analyzed SAM data from EXIM and the General Services Administration (GSA). GAO also reviewed documentation reflecting EXIM's fraud risk assessment. The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) has taken steps to identify and mitigate fraud risks, but it is not yet clear whether these actions fully respond to the recommendations GAO made in a July 2018 report ( GAO-18-611 ). GAO identified fraud risks—generally involving four overall fraud risk factors—by examining 44 EXIM-associated cases adjudicated in federal and state courts from calendar year 2012 through calendar year 2017. These 44 cases illustrate the financial risk associated with fraud against EXIM. For example, as of October 2018, the total remaining unpaid restitution amount is $71.6 million, or over 80 percent. EXIM reported having existing antifraud controls to mitigate the fraud risks identified in these 44 cases. For each fraud risk, EXIM used a list of “red flags” to identify indicators of potential fraud and corruption that may appear on transaction documents. These red flags include opportunities to falsify self-reported information on applications or financial pressures that potentially incentivized participants or employees to commit fraud, opportunities to circumvent or take advantage of EXIM or lender controls, or opportunities to diverting loan proceeds and other financing for personal use or benefit instead of for the export of U. S. goods. For the 44 fraud cases GAO examined, the risk factors identified were generally already known to EXIM as they relate to or are very similar to those fraud Risk factors contained in the list of red flags. Examinations of these fraud risks can further help EXIM mitigate fraud and the resulting effects across all product lines before they occur, which includes the length of time it can take for EXIM to fully recover from restitution losses after fraud has been perpetrated, as illustrated in the 44 cases presented in the figure below. The Department of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller General's (OIG) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-129 prescribes to agencies the policies, procedures, and standards for screening program participants to determine whether they are delinquent on any federal debt when applying to federal credit programs, including recommending that agencies ask applicants to self-certify on their applications that they have no delinquencies; requiring agencies to obtain and review applicants' credit reports; and encouraging agencies to use appropriate databases, such as the Department ofthe Treasury's Do Not Pay portal sources, to identify delinquent debtors during the application screening process. According to EXim officials, the agency employs procedures to ensure its policies and processes meet these requirements for applicable financing products, including reviewing credit reports and requiring applicants to certify that they and other participants do not have such delinquent debt. However, as GAO has reported in the past, relying on applicants toSelf-certifications: EXIM applications for relevant financing programs include a self- Certification by the applicant that the applicant does not have delinquent federal Debt Subject to Offset flag, which may reflect both nontax and tax delinquent federal debts owed. The debt flag indicates that an entity potentially has a federal debt subject to collection under the Treasury Offset Program, which is a government-wide information system that federal agencies can use to obtain information on businesses that do business with the federal government, including an entity's debt status. The GSA officials who maintain the SAM database told GAO that all federal agencies have the legal authority to use the SAM registration database free of charge, and GAO confirmed that this database can be used to manually search by entities' names, Data Universal Numbering System numbers, or Tax Identification Numbers for the purpose of identifying entities that may have the Debt Subject-to-Offset flag in SAM, among other available data. In GAO's review of transactions that had an aggregate authorization value of about $34.3
The Small Business Administration's (SBA) Small Business Technology Extension Act of 1996 (TFTEA) established the STEP program, which provides grants to states to promote exports of small and medium-sized businesses. TFTEA requires SBA to match up to 25 percent of each state's total grant amount with at least half of the total match provided by the states in the form of cash and allows for the remaining half to be any mixture of cash, in-kind contributions, and indirect costs. SBA's Office of Information and Technology (OIT) is responsible for administering the program. This testimony is based on GAO's March 2016 report, Small Business: SBA Needs to Strengthen Its Oversight of the Small Business Entrepreneurship Trust Fund (GAO-16-807). It addresses (1) the extent to which SBA provides reasonable assurance that the STEP grants it awards are being used as intended, (2) challenges states face in using grant funds, and (3) SBAs process for ensuring compliance with the TFTEa cash match requirement. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and guidance; interviewed SBA and OIT officials; and interviewed officials from 12 low-use states that received STEP grants in fiscal year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available at the time of the review. GAO found that SBA does not provide reasonable assurance of compliance with some requirements of applicable law. For example, SBA must distribute grant funds in a way that caps the amount of grant funds distributed to the 10 states with the largest numbers of eligible small businesses at 40 percent of total grant funds awarded each year. However, the law does not require states to use all of their grant funds within the first 2 years of the program, and GAO identified four instances where states reported insufficient total matches in fiscal years 2015 and 2016—one in 2015 and three in 2016. In these instances, these four states failed to meet the required total matching funds by about $76,000 combined over these 2 years. In one case, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) initially stated that it was working with the state to recover the funds, but after contacting the state and looking into the matter further, determined that the state had in fact exceeded its required match by $3,800. In the case of the state that did not meet the requirement, OIT initially reported to GAO that it had overpaid federal funds to that state by $19,600, but later determined that this amount was less than the amount owed. OIT also reported that one state had met its total match requirement, but that the other had not. In GAOS report, it found that OIT does not have a process in place to ensure that states are meeting the cash matching requirement, and therefore cannot consistently determine whether states are contributing to the program as required by the law. In addition, while OIT records proposed cash match amounts, it does not track or analyze states expended cash matching funds during or at the close of the grant cycle to determine what proportion of the match the cash portion constitutes. As a result, O IT does not know whether states have complied with the cash match requirements. In our report, we also found that nearly 20 percent of STEP grant funds go unused each year, despite SBA officials stating that they seek 100 percent use for each state that receives an award. In 2015, 12 states used 75 percent or less of their funds, while 19 states used all or almost all their funds. This included one state that left nearly 95 percent, or nearly $184,000, of its funds unused that year. In 2016, the OIT made some changes to the grant program that could help enable states to better use their funds and achieve performance targets, such as extending the grant usage period to 2 years and reducing the length of the technical proposal, among other things. In commenting on a draft of this testimony, SBCA agreed with the recommendations made in the report and provided technical comments.
NASA awarded contracts in 2014 to Boeing and SpaceX, valued at up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, for the development of crew transportation systems that meet NASA requirements and for the initial service missions to the ISS. These contracts encompass the firm-fixed-price design, development, test, and evaluation work needed to support NASA's certification of the contractors' spacecraft, launch vehicle, and ground support systems. The Commercial Crew Program manages two processes in order to support the contractors uncrewed test flights, crewed test flight, and certification milestone. A three-phased safety review process informs the programs quality assurance activities and is intended to ensure that the contractors have identified all safety-critical hazards and implemented associated controls prior to the first crewed flight. Both contractors have made progress building and testing hardware for their spacecraft, including SpaceXS Dragon 2 capsule, which is to carry crew and cargo to and from the ISS, and Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner capsule and service module, which will carry the crew. However, continued schedule delays and remaining work for the contractors and the program create uncertainty about when either contractor will be certified to begin conducting operational missions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has made progress reviewing the certification paperwork, but contractor delays in submitting evidence for NASA approval may compound a “bow wave” of work, which creates uncertainty about the timing of certification. In February 2019, NASA announced plans to purchase two additional Soyuz seats from Russia, citing concerns about the difficulties associated with achieving first flights in the final year of development. These seats would extend U.S. access to the International Space Station from November 2019 through September 2020. In March 2018, NASA modified its contract with Boeing to allow NASA to add a third crew member and extend the length of the crewedtest flight. In July 2018, GAO reported that NASA was considering this option as one way to maintain a U. S. presence on the ISS but noted it had limited usefulness if Boeing s crewed tests slipped past the return date of the last Soyuz flight. GAO recommended in July 2018 that NASA develop and maintain a contingency plan for ensuring a presence in the ISS until a Commercial Crew program contractor is certified. NASA concurred with this recommendation but, to fully implement it, NASA needs to provide additional support regarding planning efforts to ensure uninterrupted access to ISS if delays with the commercial crew contractors continue beyond 2020. Continued NASA attention on this issue is needed given the uncertainty associated with the final certification dates. As of May 2019, both contractors have delayed their certification milestone nine times since establishing dates in their original contracts. In the span of less than a year, Boeing has again delayed its certification milestone four times and by 12 months, while SpaceX has delayed its milestone three times by 7 months. The contractors are now planning for certification to occur more than 2 years beyond the original dates in the contractsBoeing in January 2020 and SpaceX in September 2019, though this date is under review and could further slip.
In 2015, the Navy transitioned to the MAC-MO strategy for ship maintenance and modernization. Under this strategy, the Army, Navy, and Navy Corps of Engineers are to award contracts for ship repair work at each of the three ports implementing the strategy—Mayport, Florida; Norfolk, Virginia; and San Diego, California. GAO was asked to review the Navy's implementation of the strategy. This report (1) examines competition, cost, schedule, and quality outcomes under the strategy; (2) evaluates actions the Navy has taken related to recent lessons learned; and (3) describes considerations informing contractors' plans for future hiring and facilities investments. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed Navy data on ship repair availabilities, reviewed Navy documentation, and interviewed Navy and contractor officials. The Navy has achieved some, but not all, of the goals it set for the Multi-Award Contract, Multi-Order (MAC-MO) contract strategy. For example, it has increased opportunities for competition by awarding a delivery order for each ship repair availability and has received more offers for its delivery orders than under the prior strategy, known as Multi-Ship, Multi - Option (MSMO). However, the results in cost and schedule outcomes have been mixed. Through April 2019, the Department of the Navy had completed 41 closed out Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) availabilities under its MAC- MO strategy with, on average, 5 percent cost growth and 30 percent schedule growth. Further, the schedule growth was due to unplanned work, which can often be unavoidable in ship repair and detracted from both cost and scheduling performance. The MAC-Oriented Maritime Construction and Maintenance Organization (MAC) strategy has also provided opportunities for small businesses to compete for noncomplex work. For instance, small businesses are able to compete as prime contractors for non-complex work, and small businesses that previously worked as subcontractors for the businesses that held one of the MSMO contracts are now acting as the prime contractors under the new strategy. The new MAC-OMO strategy's fixed-price contracts help enable the Navy to ensure quality of work and GAO found no evidence of deficient work at availability completion in GAO's review of four completed case studies. However, Navy officials stated that they have had difficulty negotiating contract changes and agreeing on costs in a timely manner in order to minimize schedule impact. In response to lessons learned from the Navys efforts to implement the strategy, Congress enacted legislation in December 2019 that provides the Navy with a pilot program in fiscal year 2020 that allows it to use procurement funds to fund ship availabilities for the first time. The pilot program is intended to provide the Navy a platform to potentially demonstrate that it can meet its schedule goals when freed from the time intensive process of upward obligations, which requires approval from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Comptroller before funding growth work that occurs in subsequent fiscal years and exceeds $4 millionan amount established under a 1990 law. In GAOS review of Navy budget documentation, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to execute 16 pilot availabilities using fiscal year (FY) 2020 OPN funds, and it has requested funding for another 26 in FY 2021. Although the Navy is likely to learn lessons from its OPN-funded pilot program availabilities that relate to schedule drivers currently overshadowed by delays cast by the upward obligations process, it is not yet certain whether it will address schedule outcomes and lessons learned within future biennial assessments. As the Navy moves into implementation of its pilot program, establishing a plan for analysis of the pilot program would provide a means to identify opportunities to take the data on availability schedules, which Congress directed, and compare it to the schedule performance the Navy have attained in its other non-pilot, MAC-LO availabilities. Such evaluations would provide information to the Navy and Congress to determine if the pilot approach should be expanded to help address persistent schedule challenges.
GAO and others have identified challenges specific to VA's management and oversight. These challenges have affected VA's ability to accomplish its mission economically, efficiently, and effectively. GAO was asked to review VA's succession planning for leadership and mission-critical occupations. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which VA has an up-to-date, department-wide succession plan for leadership positions and (2) whether VA's efforts to develop a pipeline of talent to fill leadership positions are consistent with leading practices for succession planning. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed VA succession planning documents and interviewed VA officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Veterans Benefits Administration ( VBA) have taken important steps to develop talent to meet VA's mission. For example, each has developed training and development programs for aspiring leaders. However, VA does not have a current department- wide succession plan, as required by its own succession planning directive, and has not met four of the key leading practices in succession planning, but has partially met one practice. VHA and VBA have partially met three and did not meet two practices, respectively. VA's leadership has not ensured that VHA has complete workforce data, and VHA's monitoring and evaluation of its succession plans is limited. In addition, VHA does not provide leadership succession planning guidance to medical centers because it has started to centralize succession planning at the national level. Additional support and involvement from top leadership, such as providing additional oversight and guidance, could help to ensure VHA is meeting department-level succession planning requirements, and ensure that succession planning efforts achieve workforce goals. VA has not updated its succession planning directives since 2003, and VA officials told GAO that the directive does not incorporate legal requirements put in place since then. Updating the directive could help VA to clarify and recommunicate succession planning roles and responsibilities across the department and its administrations. VA also did not provide evidence that it monitors and evaluates workforce planning strategies, which is required by the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) strategic human capital management regulations. Monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of strategies, policies, programs, and activities is a key system established in OPM's regulations and requires agencies to identify, implement, and monitor process improvements. VA officials stated that they had to delay updating the directive to revise it to incorporate new regulatory and legislative changes that occurred during past efforts to update the directive. VA did not update its directive due to leadership turnover and other factors, but doing so could help ensure that it is complying with legal requirements that have been put into place since 2003. The VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 requires VA to establish a single database that lists vacant positions that the Secretary determines are critical to the mission of VA, difficult to fill, or both.
The Department of Defense (DOD) has established processes to identify capability gaps within the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), develop and select training needed to address those gaps, and identify associated funding requirements. To do so, DOD works with various partner organizations to identify ANDSF training needs and associated funding needs. These partner organizations include the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command (CSTC-A) and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSA). These organizations request the resourcing of these training needs through the Afghan Security Forces Fund (ASFF). ASFF is generally a 2-year appropriation that is used to provide assistance, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, to the security forces of Afghanistan, including the provision of equipment, supplies, services, training, facility and infrastructure repair, renovation, construction, and funding. The Senate Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's processes for developing and executing ASFF-funded training contracts. This report examines (1) the processes used to develop and execute ASFF training contracts, (2) the extent to which DOD has visibility over these contracts, and (3) the amount of training provided under these contracts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant DOD guidance and documents and interviewed DOD officials. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. DOD officials stated that they believe they have sufficient tools to identify most training contracts funded through the ASFF. DOD's Office of the Overseas Contingency Operations Comptroller tracks and reports ASFF obligations and disbursements in monthly status-of-funds reports, known as Defense Financial and Accounting Services 1002 Reports. In addition, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction reports on ASFF in quarterly reports to Congress. At the individual contract level, the military services' contracting commands, such as the Army Contracting Command and PEO-STRI, develop and maintain contract files for individual training contracts and task orders. However, according to officials, DOD does not have a centralized system or reporting mechanism for tracking all training contracts because the systems used by the services for managing funding and those used for contract management do not interface with each other. As a result, officials said that in the single instance in which they have had to develop a comprehensive list of all ASFF funded training contracts they had to work with the contracting commands at the respective military services to gather this information. As part of its efforts to provide training for the Afghan Army, the Army's Central Training Command-Afghanistan has developed and executed training contracts using ASFF funds under a process modeled on the foreign military sales (FMS) program, referred to as “pseudo-FMS.” As indicated by guidance, these pseudo-F MS procurements are FMS-like cases and use U. S. funds to purchase items, services and training for ANDSf capability requirements. The process is outlined in the Security Assistance Management Manual, which provides DOD-wide guidance to DOD components engaged in the management or implementation of DOD security assistance and security cooperation programs over which the Defense security Cooperation Agency has responsibility. The five general phases of the process include assistance request, agreement development, acquisition, delivery, and case closure. Prior to April 2019, training requirements were generally provided by a single vendor under a single award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract known as the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (WFF) contract. According to Army contracting officials, WFF was the most expedient way to contract for various types of training for Afghan National Army training due to the contract's broad scope and $11.2 billion ceiling. These officials said it provided the capacity and flexibility needed to fulfill Afghan Army requirements and time frames in a streamlined way because the competition and award process had already occurred, enabling officials to move directly to awarding task orders for support. In 2018, DOD decided to replace WFF with a series of new contracts, the first of which was awarded in 2018, and has begun to transition work previously performed under WFF to these new contracts. The first training task order under the Enterprise Training Services Contract was issued in April 2019.
The Small Business Administration's (SBA) Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Program provides grants to small businesses to deliver business advising and technical assistance to prospective and existing small businesses. SBA provides grants covering 50 percent or less of SBDC program costs. As a condition of the grant, SBDCs are required to provide 100 percent matching funds from nonfederal sources, which are used to cover remaining program costs and are generally reimbursed for allowable program costs, up to the amount of the federal award and provided such costs adhere to the budget approved by SBA. GAO was asked to review the SBDC Program. This report discusses the (1) SBA's rationale for changing the way it estimates funding in the annual SBDC funding opportunity announcement and (2) the views of grantees on the effect of that change on their budgeting and operations. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed SBA funding opportunity announcements for fiscal years 2012 through 2020, reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance, and surveyed all 62 lead centers, selected to achieve diversity in funding amount, budget cycle, and host institution. In fiscal year 2016, SBA changed the methodology it used for the funding estimate for the Small Business development center program. Prior to that year, the agency used the prior year's appropriated amount for the program as the estimate, but this was not always the case. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the funding estimates and appropriations began to diverge significantly (funding estimates decreased, appropriations increased). SBA cited two reasons for the change: to conform to federal financial management practices and to address concerns about violating the Antideficiency Act. In a letter to the Senate and House Small Business Committees in December 2019, SBI stated that the change was in response to areas requiring process improvements and stronger internal controls to help the program operate and plan more effectively and efficiently and in consistency with federal management standards. However, SBNB officials did not point to a specific regulation or guidance to support this view, either in the letter or in interviews with GAO. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) staff told GAO that, in the absence of a full-year appropriation, it is permissible for agencies to use the lowest estimate (the lowest among the House mark, Senate mark, President's budget request, and the previous year's appropriation) as the basis for their initial funding applications. SBDC grantees reported that using the lower funding estimate in the initial funding application for fiscal year 2020 (which was $30 million below the 2019 appropriation and $34 million below 2020 appropriation) created burdens and challenges in budgeting, operations, and services. For example, one SBDC said that the lower amount required more time for negotiations to assure their matching partners that the actual number would likely be higher. Forty-four of the 60 grantees that responded to GAO's survey (73 percent) said using the lowest funding estimate had somewhat or greatly hindered their ability to hire new personnel, and 35 of 60 (58 percent) reported having difficulty in retaining personnel. In response to open-ended survey questions, grantees also noted difficulties in obtaining matching funds, such as difficulty obtaining full matching funding, having to spend grant funds early in the year, and having to carry over unspent grant funds to the next year. In prior work and survey responses, some grantees have suggested ways to mitigate challenges associated with budget uncertainties. For instance, one grantee suggested that Congress may include specific provisions in continuing resolutions (called legislative anomalies) that provide some agencies or programs with funding or direction different from those specified in standard provisions that require agencies to spend more conservatively.
U.S. assistance to Central America has supported three objectives—prosperity, governance, and security—since fiscal year 2013. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these objectives in the Northern Triangle. This report examines (1) the projects implemented in the region from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 to support these objectives, (2) what is known about the results of these projects, and (3) the extent to which progress has been made toward the Strategy's objectives. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C., as well as in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, where GAO conducted fieldwork in six selected sectors—economic growth, agricultural development, good government service, justice reform, community based violence prevention, and professionalize the military and develop defense capabilities. The Departments of State (State), Defense (DOD), and Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) implemented at least 370 projects to support Prosperity, Governance, and Security (Strategy) objectives in Central America's Northern Triangle from fiscal year (FY) 2013 through FY 2018. These projects generally correspond to 18 sectors that align with the three objectives of the Strategy, including the six sectors GAO selected for in-depth review. For example, USAID and USDA implemented projects in the agricultural development sector to help farmers improve agricultural management practices and increase their access to markets and capital, while State and USAID implemented projects to strengthen justice institutions, combat corruption, improve democratic processes, and advocate for the protection of human rights. State, DOD, and USDA reported that they allocated about $2.4 billion to implement these projects from FY 2013 to FY 2018, with USAID receiving the largest amount of funding (about $1.44 billion) and USDA and DOD each receiving less than $235 million. Agencies reported mixed results, primarily focused on outputs, for the 190 projects that they implemented in FY 2013-2018. While some projects in these sectors achieved the targets that agency officials established, others did not, and some did not meet the targets, such as the training of 44 fulltime peacekeeping staff in FY 2017, which was below the target of 155. Based on GAO's review of various performance-related documents, agencies generally reported more information about progress toward prosperity than toward governance and security. Some of the evidence about governance andsecurity may be limited because evaluations were conducted unevenly across agencies and sectors. In addition, project implementers did not consistently collect key information to assess progress toward the objectives. Nevertheless, agency officials cited examples of important results and challenges to achieving progress toward achieving the objectives, including technical assistance to enhance crop research and water and soil conservation, which contributed to increased agricultural production. In its coordinating role, State has not created a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan for the Strategy that specifies an approach to evaluating progress across all agencies. In response to direction contained in committee reports accompanying several State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations acts, State developed and updated a plan for FY 2018 to implement the Strategy. However, the plan, while consistent with the committee reports' direction, is not comprehensive. In particular, it does not incorporate all the relevant agencies, sectors, and activities that support the Strategy’s objectives. State officials stated that the plan is not inclusive of DOD and USDA activities because the legislative direction for the plan did not require it. The Strategy, however, intends to take a comprehensive, integrated, and whole of government approach to engagement in Central American. State is well positioned to work collaboratively with officials from other agencies to develop a comprehensive approach to monitoring the impact of all activities across all sectors that directly support the strategy's objectives, and to ensure that agencies collaborate effectively and that monitoring is well coordinated and documented in a comprehensive plan.
School-age children in lower-income households may be more likely than children in higher-income families to be reliant on mobile wireless service, such as through smart phones, for internet access. GAO was asked to review issues related to the homework gap. This report examines: (1) challenges lower- income children who lack in-home fixed internet face in doing homework that involves internet access; and (2) what selected school districts are doing to expand wireless internet access for their students, and the federal role in such efforts. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Census Bureau's November 2017 Current Population Survey: Computer and Internet Use Supplement, which is sponsored by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). GAO also interviewed officials with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Education (Education) and reviewed a non-generalizable sample of six projects involving seven local school districts that are taking steps to provide wireless access outside of school for students who may lack internet at home. According to GAO's analysis of November 2017 Census Bureau (CPS) data on computer and internet use, lower- Income School-age Children in Lower-Income Households: Computer, Internet, and Home Use (GAO-17-611 ) face challenges doing homework involving internet access and may be less likely to rely on fixed high-speed internet service. For example, according to a 2018 Pew Research Center survey, a higher percentage of surveyed teens in lower income households said that the lack of a dependable computer or internet connection sometimes prevents them from finishing their homework compared to teens in higher income households. In addition, as much communication between schools and parents has moved online, it may make it difficult for parents to stay connected to teachers and be informed about school notices, homework assignments, and other important information. For students who lack fixed internet access at home, school districts have taken a variety of approaches to address this gap, including building out new or expanding existing networks to provide internet access to students, building or using a private network, and equipping school buses with Wi-Fi. However, these efforts may be inhibited by existing restrictions in FCC's E-rate program, which provides discounts on telecommunications and internet services to schools and school districts. Specifically, FCC's rules specify that off-premises use of such services is not eligible for E- Rate support and require that any off- Premises traffic must be cost allocated out of school districts' E-Rate discounts. In May 2016, the Boulder Valley School District filed a petition requesting a waiver of the cost allocation rules in order to use its E- rate-program-supported network to provide access to children at public housing facilities after school hours. FCC rules allow parties to petition for waivers of rules if they can demonstrate that special circumstances warrant deviation from the existing rules and doing so serves the public interest. In September 2016, FCC issued a Public Notice requesting public comment on two petitions filed with the agency seeking to allow the petitioning school districts to allow them to use existing services and equipment for off-Premises access without having to cost-allocate that traffic out of their existing E-rates. FCC has not yet taken further formal action on this Public Notice. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use quality information to make decisions and communicate information to external parties. Determining and executing a methodology for collecting and analyzing data on the potential costs, benefits, and challenges of making schools' efforts to expand off- premises wireless access eligible for program funding could help inform FCC decisions regarding the two pending petitions and any future petitions. Publishing the results of this analysis could help FCC ensure that such information will be accessible to inform future related efforts and provide transparency to external stakeholders.
The federal government has provided significant funds for transit services following past catastrophic disasters, such as the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and Hurricane Sandy. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are the federal government's primary agencies for disaster response and recovery. In February 2018, Congress appropriated funds to FTA's Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program for the 2017 hurricanes to repair and replace transit infrastructure. This report examines (1) FTA's allocation of emergency relief funds to transit agencies for response, recovery, and rebuilding projects, and (2) the extent to which FTA and FEMA coordinated to avoid duplicate funding. GAO reviewed FTA's and FEMA's policies and procedures and interviewed FTA, FEMA, and transit agency officials. FTA announced on May 31, 2018, that it would allocate about $233 million to 52 transit agencies, with approximately 85 percent of the funds ($198 million) going to Puerto Rico. Most of Puerto Rico's funds will be distributed to San Juan's rail transit service provider, Tren Urbano. FTA allocated funds for various purposes including repairs to rail stations and bus terminals, repair and replacement of vehicles, and repairs to transit buildings and facilities. After FTA allocates funds, transit agencies must submit grant applications with detailed information about each eligible project activity and expense. As of October 2019, 19 transit agencies had submitted grant applications to FTA, and FTA approved and obligated funding for each of the 19 applicants. FTA officials told GAO they are working with the remaining transit agencies on submitting and finalizing their grant applications. More than half of FTA's grantees responding to GAO's survey reported some interaction with FEMA's Public Assistance Program, which provides funding to state and local governments and some nonprofit organizations for recovery efforts after a disaster, including removing debris, implementing emergency protective measures, and repairing or replacing damaged public equipment or facilities. FTA did not receive an appropriation until roughly 6 months after the first hurricane's landfall. FTA grantees, unaware of when or whether FTA would receive an appropriations, could apply during this period to FEMA for funding. As a result, some transit agencies that initially worked with FEMA had to begin a new application with FTA. After Congress appropriated funding to FTA for the hurricanes, the two agencies initiated their communication and coordination agreements, including the memorandum of agreement (MOA) and communications protocol, which define coordination activities between the agencies. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, suchAs the risk of providing duplicate funding, and GAO found that FEMA and FTA both approved about $35,000 in funding to one applicant for the same expenses in Collier County, Florida, in April 2019. After GAO notified the agencies that they both appeared to have awarded the same expense, FEMA conducted an additional review and found that both agencies had also approved $29,000 for repairs to a transit facility. FEMA officials stated they were in the process of de-obligating those funds as well. Although both agencies awarded funds to Colliercounty, the County had not yet executed the FTA grant or drawn down any of the federal funds. FTA took steps to strengthen its processes after GAO identified this duplicate funding and FEMA conducted additional retroactive reviews to identify any additional duplicative funding. However, FEMA will continue to face challenges in identifying transit expenses when they are included in the application of a larger entity such as a city, county, or state government. For example, FEMA may be unaware of transit agencies receiving FEMA funds if these agencies are not direct recipients of such funds, but rather receive funds through larger entities such as cities, counties, or states.
In 2008, Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) to help address discrepancies in health care coverage between mental illnesses and physical illnesses. MHPAEA requires coverage for mental health and substance use disorder (MH/SU) services—when those services are offered by group health plans sponsored by large employers (generally employers with more than 50 employees)—to be no more restrictive than coverage for medical/surgical services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) extended MH/SU parity requirements to individual insurance plans and some small group plans. PPACA requires GAO to report on compliance with these requirements. This report examines (1) practices for overseeing compliance with MH/su parity requirements among state and federal agencies and (2) the extent to which states, DOL, CMS, and available research identified plan or issuer noncompliance with specific requirements in 2017 and 2018. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; surveyed a nongeneralizable sample of 50 states and the District of Columbia; reviewed relevant literature; and interviewed officials from DOL and CMS, industry, consumer advocacy, and research organizations. Practices for oversight of compliance with mental health/substance use disorder parity requirements vary among states and agencies. Nearly all states reported in GAO's survey that they review issuers selling fully insured group and individual health plans for compliance before consumers enroll in plans, and 27 states reported conducting some type of review after consumers enroll. However, the type and frequency of these reviews vary, particularly for the reviews conducted after consumers enrolled in plans. For example, GAO found that 20 states conducted targeted reviews based on consumer complaints or other information, while other states reported they had never performed such a review. The Department of Labor (DOL) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversee employer-sponsored group plans to ensure their compliance with federal mental health insurance parity requirements. DOL's and CMS's oversight is based on information and complaints about potential noncompliance, but the agencies receive relatively few consumer complaints and refer a small percentage of those complaints to DOL for review. In fiscal year 2018, for example, the agencies received 129 complaints, and most of the noncompliance DOL identified was found through reviews triggered by other federal health care laws, such as a plan failing to provide a document explaining the health benefits covered. The agencies do not have the authority to take direct enforcement actions against plan issuers for noncompliance. Without evaluating the effectiveness of their oversight approach, they do not know whether their oversight is adequate or whether they need to adopt additional strategies and seek new authorities, if needed. Enforcement activities and research identified some health plans that were not fully compliant with specific MH/ SU parity requirements in fiscal years 2017 and2018. Specifically, 17 of the 51 states reported identifying noncompliance a total of 254 times among issuers of individual plans and fully insured, employer- sponsored group plans in fiscal year 2017 and 113 times in 2018. The scope of noncompliance identified varied in terms of the number of consumers enrolled and the total number of treatments allowed, but most noncompliance was related to copayments, financial requirements, or non-quantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs), which are non-numerical limitations on the scope or duration of services. According to advocacy groups and state officials, stakeholders and researchers GAO interviewed and some of the research reviewed, the full extent of compliance is not known. As NAIC and consumer advocacy stakeholders have reported, regulators often rely on both individual complaints and aggregate consumer complaint statistics to identify problem issuers and problem areas for additional oversight, but stakeholders from eight consumer advocacy groups told GAO that complaints are not a good measure of whether parity issues exist and do not accurately reflect the numbers of enrollees facing problems with parity. Stakeholders also noted that consumers may not be aware of parity requirements and may decide not to file a complaint due to the stigma associated with treatment challenges. Further, officials from 21 states reported not providing any public information to consumers about parity requirements, which may contribute to a general lack of consumer awareness in these states. The Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor, and the Treasury (Treasury) have coordinated to provide support and jointly develop guidance for state regulators, insurance officials, and consumers.
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review certain matters related to CMP. This report (1) examines the Army's and CMP's procedures to address requirements governing the transfer and sale of firearms; (2) examines CMPs primary sources of revenue, costs and profits, and estimated future revenue associated with the sale of surplus firearms; and (3) compares certain aspects of CMP’s business operations with those of five selected youth-focused, federally chartered nonprofit corporations. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agreements between the Army and the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). GAO also interviewed officials from CMP and eight other youth- focused, federallychartered nonprofits. The Army and C MPP have established procedures to transfer and sell surplus firearms, such as surplus M1911 handguns and surplus rifles, and associated parts, ammunition, and parts, to the public. CMP is authorized to sell these firearms to individuals who are U.S. citizens, legally of age, and members of affiliated gun clubs (e.g., gun clubs throughout the United States). CMP must obtain a license and operate as a federal firearms licensee (FFL) in order to sell the surplus firearms. The Department of the Army (Army) transferred about 8,000 surplus handguns to C MPM in January 2018, and about 7,223 surplus rifles from the Army in fiscal years 2008 through 2017, according to Army data. Cmp is required to reimburse the Army for certain costs associated with these transfers, including transportation, supply depot operations, and administrative support. For example, in fiscal year 2017, CMP reimbursed the Army a total of $5 million for transportation costs for the transfer of surplus rifles and $4 million for administrative support, including the cost of one full-time equivalent position to help administer the identification and shipment of these firearms. According to GAO's analysis of IRS filings and internal CMP financial documents, the primary source of revenue for CMP from fiscal years 2016 through 2017 was the sales of surplus Army rifles. These sales generated $196.8 million in revenue. However, the profit that CMP realized from these sales could not be determined because the methodology CMP used to calculate the expenses to sell surplus rifles did not account for all of the expenses for these sales, including depreciation and administrative expenses. C MP officials anticipate generating additional revenue from the future sale of the surplus handguns and rifles CMP currently has available to sell, which GAO estimates could generate as much as $104.9 million in future revenue, or enough to fund CMP operations for several more years. In addition, GAO examined five other federally chartering corporations that have a similar focus on the development, education, or training of youth. Four of the six corporations, including CMP, have received federal funding or resources, and each of the corporations is governed by some form of a board of directors. For instance, the Civil Air Patrol, Future Farmers of America, and the Boy Scouts of America each have a Board of Directors with repeatable 2-year term limits, while the Naval Sea Cadet Corps has a Chairman of the Board who also serves as the Chief Executive Officer. The fifth corporation, the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America has an 11-member Board of Governors that may or may not have term limits. The five selected corporations differ in some aspects of their business operations, but differ in their relationship with members, which CMP officials refer to as “affiliated groups,” such as gun clubs, throughout the country. In contrast, officials from the other five corporations told GAO that their members and affiliated groups are part of the organization as a whole.
In 1999, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued a report stating that, based on experience from a decade of planning and conducting cleanup work at the sites for which it is responsible, complete restoration to levels acceptable for unrestricted use could not be accomplished at many of its sites. As a result, DOE reported that long-term management would be needed at these sites to ensure that the actions, systems, or other measures put in place to clean up a site would protect human health and the environment from these hazards into the future. In 2003, DOE established the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LM) to assume responsibility for 100 sites across the United States, including sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico, that have been cleaned up by DOE or other entities. GAO was asked to review LM's management of these sites. This report examines (1) the extent to which LM's environmental liability has changed in recent years, (2) the challenges that LM faces in providing longterm surveillance and maintenance of sites, and (3) how LM plans to address challenges that may arise as it acquires additional sites. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed LM's fiscal year 2019 environmental liability estimates, reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance, and interviewed DOE and LM officials. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) total environmental liability—the amount of cleanup and waste disposal costs associated with five main activities at its sites—was estimated at $7.35 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2019, an amount that has been relatively stable over the last 5 years, according to LM financial data. However, the environmental liability is likely to grow as the agency acquires more sites in future years. According to an LM document, as of September 2019, LM is scheduled to acquire 52 additional sites by 2050, including six category 3 sites, 45 category 2 sites and one category 1 site. Since LM does not account for the environmental liabilities for a portion of its current sites until it has acquired them, LM officials could not tell GAO by how much its environmental liability will increase as a result of acquiring these sites, but officials said that some sites transitioning to LM in the future will be larger and have more extensive residual contamination than sites that LM has previously acquired. LM faces a number of challenges that could require new cleanup work, such as challenges with the performance of remedies, environmental conditions, and new requirements and regulations. For example, at the Monticello site in Utah, the groundwater treatment remedy that was originally agreed to by DOE, EPA, and the Utah state regulator proved ineffective in meeting cleanup goals within a few years of being implemented and of the site being transferred to LM. In 2015, LM implemented a pump-and- treat approach that reduced contamination; however, officials told GAO that the efficacy of this approach has declined over time, and LM is again seeking to change the remedy. LM is taking some actions to address some of these challenges, but it has not developed agreements or procedures with DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM) or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for addressing challenges that require new, active cleanup work. By working with EM and NRC to develop such procedures, LM can help ensure mitigation by the most appropriate entity of the risks to human health or the environment that such instances would present. Environmental conditions also present challenges to LM's sites and may become more frequent or intense as the effects of climate change become more severe or intense. In February 2013, as part of GAO's 2013 list of areas at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or most in need of transformation, it added Limiting the Federal Government's Fiscal Exposure by Better Managing Climate Change Risks to its list of high-risk areas. In its March 2019 update to this high risk area, it reported that the federal government needs to improve the resilience of facilities it owns and operates, and land it manages, against climate change. In October 2019, it found that EPA needs to take additional actions to improve management of risks from climate change at Superfund sites where remedies may need to be operational indefinitely. EPA lists some of the most seriously contaminated sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) and has recorded over 500 contaminants at those sites. In addition, available federal data on flooding, storm surge, wildfires, and sea level rise suggest that about 60 percent of all nonfederal NPL sites are located in areas that may be impacted by these potential climate change effects.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is the primary federal agency responsible for security in all modes of transportation, including surface transportation, such as mass transit, passenger and freight rail, highway, and pipeline, as well as aviation. TSA's Surface Programs account is responsible for supporting TSA programs that are to protect the surface transportation system. The Transportation Security Act of 2002 requires GAO to report annually on TSA's surface transportation programs. This is the second in a series of reports responding to this mandate. This report examines (1) the amount of resources TSA allocated to surface transportation activities in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and (2) the extent to which TSA's guidance for its training and exercise program establishes coordination procedures and time frames. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed TSA's fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 Surface Programs budget documents and interviewed TSA officials. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Agency's (T TSA) Program, Project, or Activity (Surface Programs account) received about $113 million on average annually from fiscal years 2009 through 2018, about 1.5 percent of TSA's average annual appropriation of more than $7 billion. During that time, the appropriations directed to this account ranged from about $63 million to nearly $135 million annually. For example, in fiscal year 2019, TSA plans to request about $129 million for this account, which is less than 2 percent of the agency's appropriation. TSA allocated most of its Surface Programs resources to three offices: Security Operations; Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service; and Policy, Plans, and Engagement. These offices were collectively allocated about 99 percent of all Surface Programs funding in 2017 and 93 percent in 2018. In addition, some resources were used for non-surface activities such as aviation-related activities. TSA also funds surface inspectors and their supervisors from the Surface Program account; however, surface inspectors can assist with aviation security activities, as GAO reported in 2017. GAO found that TSA had incomplete information on the total time surface inspectors spent on those activities because of limitations in TSA's data system. Since then, TSA updated its system to include a field indicating whether the activity was conducted in the surface or aviation mode, demonstrating that TSA has visibility over all activities surface inspectors conduct. TSA guidance does not fully identify the roles and responsibilities for key TSA offices or time frames for when those offices should coordinate to support training and Exercise planning. TSA officials stated that they plan to revise the 2016 Surface Division's Internal Operating Procedure, which provides guidance for planning and implementing training and exercises. This planned revision presents an opportunity to identify and clarify roles for all offices involved in the coordination of the exercise, including when they should to coordinate.
The U.S. electric grid faces an increasing array of cybersecurity risks, as well as significant challenges to addressing those risks. For example, according to the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment, China and Russia pose the greatest cyberattack threats; of particular concern, they possess the ability to launch cyberattacks that could cause localized, temporary disruptive effects on critical infrastructure. GAO was asked to review the cybersecurity of the grid. This report (1) describes the cybersecurity risks and challenges facing the grid, (2) describes efforts to address these risks, (3) assesses the extent to which the Department of Energy (DOE) has a defined strategy for addressing grid cybersecurity, and (4) examines the extent that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) approved cybersecurity standards address grid cybersecurity risks. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed key federal and nonfederal entities' reports, plans, and other documents, and interviewed officials from DOE, FERC, DHS, NERC, and national associations representing grid owners and operators. The grid faces significant cybersecurity risks—that is, threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts—and faces significant challenges in addressing these risks. Threat actors are becoming increasingly capable of carrying out attacks on the grid and, at the same time, the grid is becoming more vulnerable to attacks. According to federal agencies, nations, criminal groups, and terrorists pose the most significant cyber threats to the grid; however, hackers and hacktivists and insiders also pose significant threats. With respect to the potential impacts of the threats and vulnerabilities, federal agencies have performed three assessments of the potential impact of cyberattacks on grid operations, but the potential scale of any associated outages is uncertain due to limitations in the assessments. As grid operators attempt to address cybersecurity risks in a number of ways, they face challenges, such as difficulties in hiring a sufficient cybersecurity workforce, limited public-private information sharing, limited resources to invest in cybersecurity protections, reliance on other critical infrastructure that may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, and uncertainties about how to implement cybersecurity standards and guidance. Federal agencies have taken a variety of critical infrastructure protection and regulatory actions aimed at addressing grid cyber risks. In particular, DOE has developed plans and an assessment aimed at implementing the federal strategy for confronting cyber threats. However, the plans and assessment do not fully address all of the key characteristics needed for a national strategy to be effective in allocating resources, defining policies, and helping to ensure accountability. In addition, neither the plans nor the assessment fully analyzed the cybersecurity challenges to thegrid. Specifically, none of the plans or the assessment analyzed the threat of, and vulnerabilities to, a cyberattack involving high-wattage consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to the distribution system. Further, only one of the two plans—DOE's Multiyear Plan for Energy Sector Cybersecurity—includes milestones and performance measures for achieving the goals, objectives, and activities. Until DOE ensures it has a plan for implementing a federal cybersecurity strategy for the grid that addresses all key characteristics of a strategy, decision makers' ability to allocate resources to address risks will likely be limited. FERC has not ensured that its approved grid cybersecurity standards fully address leading federal guidance for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity—specifically addressing the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (commonly known as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework). Specifically, the standards do not call for risk management processes to be established, organizational risk tolerance to be determined, or for the organization's role in critical infrastructure and sector-specific risk analysis to be informed by its role in the supply chain, among other things. Moreover, while the standards substantially address two-thirds, but not all, of the framework's five functions and 23 categories, they do not address the remaining three functions.
The U.S.-flag maritime industry is critical to the nation's economic well-being and national security. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is the primary federal agency responsible for federal policy in support of the industry. DOT has been required by law to develop a national maritime strategy by February 2020 to address industry challenges and ensure the viability of sealift capability. GAO was asked to review issues related to the maritime industry. This report examines (1) the extent to which maritime industry challenges could affect national defense and federal actions to address them, and (2) how federal actions are being taken to support industry and meet defense needs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies; analyzed federal assessments of industry challenges; and interviewed federal officials from DOT, the Department of Defense (DOD), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal agencies with maritime roles and responsibilities, as well as 10 industry stakeholders selected based on factors such as industry size, location, and location of shipyard capacity. The maritime industry faces an array of challenges that could negatively affect national security, and selected industry stakeholders GAO interviewed identified several areas in which these challenges could impact national defense. All 10 of the 10 stakeholders identified at least one challenge related to each of the three broad sectors of the sector: ships, shipyards, and mariners. For example, 7 of 10 stakeholders expressed concern that declines in the size of the fleet could lead to shortfalls in overall capacity or the number of certain types of ships needed to carry defense cargo. Federal actions to support the industry are largely limited to the administration of long-standing programs and policies and studying underlying issues, rather than new efforts to confront these challenges. Established federal policies and programs—including the Maritime Security Program (MSP), cargo preference requirements, and the Jones Act, among others—have not markedly changed in recent years. Officials explained that within the existing statutory framework, they have tried to better align the MSP fleet with defense needs, such as by enrolling three roll on/roll off ships that provide a net increase in square footage compared to the ships they replaced, among other improvements. Cargo preference requirements have largely remained the same since 2012. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) has made efforts to better ensure these requirements are understood and followed by federal contracting officers, contractors, and sub-contractors who make shipping decisions and are supposed to abide by these requirements. Specifically, MARAD has developed training on cargo preference and conducted outreach to various agencies and industries. Further, agencies have taken other actions to improve existing programs in ways that could aid defense, including initiatives to make it easier for veterans to earn merchant marine credentials and bureaucratic improvements to speed the process to flag a ship in the United States. In addition, DOT and DOD officials identified several recent and ongoing efforts to study the industry and recent trends, including a new effort to survey mariners to determine the number who are qualified, available, and willing to serve on short notice on government-owned sealift ships or commercial ships in times of national emergencies or to meet defense sealift needs. However, at this early date, DOT does not have specific plans for how to use the information gathered to change programs or practices. DOT is also in the process of revising the draft maritime strategy, which was originally completed in 2016, and has gone through three subsequent phases of development—DOT revision, OMB's interagency review, and a renewed interagency working group. DOT officials stated the department remains committed to meeting the deadline to submit a finalized strategy by the February 2020 deadline.
The NDAA requires DHS to develop and implement 43 border security metrics in four domains—between ports of entry (POE), at POEs, the maritime border, and air and marine security in the land environment—for each of the four domains. GAO was asked to review DHS's implementation of the NDAA. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which DHS reported information on 35 of the 43 required metrics in its fiscal year 2017 Border Security Metrics Report, and (2) processes DHS components have to help ensure the reliability of the data and the quality of the information used in the report. To do this work, GAO reviewed DHS's report and interviewed DHS officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported information for 35 of 43 metrics called for in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) and generally included elements listed in theNDAA. For example, DHS reported the number of detected unlawful entries between POEs and estimated undetected unlawful entries over a 10-year period. However, DHS did not provide information on the extent of uncertainty related to this estimate, such as margins of error or confidence intervals, which would help convey how the estimates might vary due to randomness in the data. In addition, DHS provided a single rate that does not fully convey the difficulty and uncertainty of estimating partially unobserved metrics such as unlawful entries and the probability of detection. DHS components generally have processes to ensure data reliability and quality, but DHS does not have a systematic process for reviewing data to identify limitations related to the metrics, and GAO identified at least one additional limitation for 21 of the 35 metrics DHS reported on which it did not disclose limitations or could have been more transparent about the limitations or assumptions in its report. By developing and implementing a process to systematically review the data, comprehensively identify any limitations, and communicate the data or methodological limitations, DHS would improve the quality and transparency of the report's data and information and facilitate a better understanding and appropriate interpretation and use of it by Congress, policymakers, and the public. To develop three metrics, DHS used a statistical model that incorporated untested assumptions about the behavior of unlawful border crossers that may not reflect real-world conditions. DHS was transparent about its model's limitations, but providing the results of sensitivity analyses and measures of statistical uncertainty would allow Congress to better understand the model's potential limitations and more fully evaluate the validity of DHS's metrics that use estimates. DHS is developing a new model to better reflect conditions at the southwest border. DHS's current statistical model was developed to sample homogenous populations that behave in set, uniform ways, but GAO's analysis of DHS data used to develop the Model-based Apprehension Rate shows that the population whose characteristics and behavior are best reflected in the statistical model has declined in recent years. Specifically, the percentage of individuals apprehended at the border who are excluded from the model because they await immigration court proceedings increased from 26 percent in fiscal year 2000 to almost 70 percent in 2016. DHS acknowledged these trends as a limitation to the effectiveness of its model. To help address limitations of its current model, DHS has invested in a new research project to estimate the total number of unlawful entries, including unknown border entries, between land POEs. According to project documentation, the project plans to leverage the CBP Tactical Simulation, an agent-based simulation of tactical border operations. Border Patrol officials stated that the first iteration of the model would be presented to Border Patrol leadership for their review at the end of fiscal year 2019 and could potentially be incorporated into the Border Patrol's next annual report. Ultimately, though, the simulation-based model may still rely upon data that would have associated uncertainty as well as assumptions that need to be validated.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) of 2003 required GAO to report on Medicare coverage options for beneficiaries. GAO examined (1) what is known about the extent to which beneficiaries are using MPF to compare coverage options, and (2) what stakeholders and research have reported about MPF's usability and usefulness to beneficiaries. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and CMS documents; surveyed a nongeneralizable sample of 40 SHIP directors; interviewed CMS officials; and interviewed stakeholders, including representatives of seven beneficiary advocacy groups and 13 research studies. The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Medicare Plan Finder (MPF) is a web-based tool that allows beneficiaries to compare the costs and coverage of different Medicare health and prescription drug coverage options in their area, including original Medicare, Medicare Advantage (MA), and Medicare Part D plans, as well as Medigap plans, which are supplemental plans offered by private insurance companies that help pay for Medicare's required cost sharing and some out-of-pocket costs not covered under original Medicare. According to CMS officials, MPF was launched in 1998 in response to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which required the agency responsible for overseeing CMS to maintain MA plan information on the internet, among other things. Since its inception, the website has undergone many modifications as new parts were added to the Medicare program, such as the addition of Part D. CMS has also taken steps to make additional changes to improve the website, including technology updates to improve system stability and performance. Stakeholders and research GAO interviewed generally indicated that MPF is difficult for beneficiaries to navigate and understand and provides incomplete information. For example, most stakeholders noted that beneficiaries must go through multiple complex pages in order to find and compare their coverage options. In addition, beneficiaries may not always understand terminology such as cost sharing, copayment, and out- of-pocket cost estimates, according to stakeholders, research studies, and survey respondents. In 2018, CMS user testing of MPF found that beneficiaries were overwhelmed by the number and complexity of options from which they had to choose. CMS is redesigning the website to make it more usable for beneficiaries and is planning to release the redesigned MPF in early August 2019. CMS officials told GAO in June 2019 that the redesigned website will allow beneficiaries to do estimated cost comparisons of MA to all of their original Medicare options, including Medicare with a prescription drug plan and original Medicare with MedigAP. CMS plans to provide more information to the redesigned site to help beneficiaries understand their options and decide whether original Medicare or MA is right for them. Once launched, CMS will incorporate feedback from this subset of users to confirm the core features that will be released in the new site prior to the next Medicare open enrollment period starting October 15, 2019. The redesigned website is expected to be available to all beneficiaries by the end of 2019.
DOD spends billions of dollars annually on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs) to acquire a wide range of goods and services, such as aircraft, ships, and missile systems. GAO was asked to review DOD's use of cost-type contracts for MDAPs. This report addresses: (1) the extent to which DOD uses cost- type contracts for these programs; (2) how DOD chooses among these contracts and monitors their performance; (3) the range of cost and schedule outcomes across these programs that used cost-Type contracts; and (4) whether DOD shares information about choosing MDAP contract types across the military departments. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of MDAP contracts awarded since fiscal year 2010, reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and policies, and interviewed DOD officials. From fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2019, a small proportion—an average of less than one-fifth—of obligations for programs in the Department of Defense's (DOD) portfolio of major acquisition programs was on cost- Type contracts. The remainder were on fixed-price contracts, split between firm-fixed-price and fixed- price-incentive contracts, as illustrated in the figure below. The Air Force made the most use of these contracts, at an average of around one-quarter of obligations. While the Army made the least use of such contracts, it made the more use of firm- fixed-priced contracts. DOD's choice of contract types is informed by assessments of program risk and uncertainty, underpinned by a number of statutory, regulatory, and policy provisions. Risk assessment also drives the application of additional reporting and surveillance requirements—designed to help the program office monitor cost- and schedule performance—once DOD has awarded a contract for an MDAP. DOD and Congress have encouraged the use of more risk-based contract types where appropriate. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD to establish a preference for fixed price contracts in the determination of contract type and specified approval requirements for use of other contract types above certain dollar thresholds. In addition, DOD's Better Buying Power initiative, which started in 2010, called for increased use of incentive contracts for programs transitioning from development to production. The Navy has generally used fixed price incentives for its shipbuilding programs, while the Air Force and Marine Corps use fixed price incentive contracts to acquire lead ships and follow-on ships, respectively, for their ships. DOD has also been limited in its ability to acquire production units absent congressional notification. DOD acquires major capabilities through the Defense Acquisition System, which implements an adaptive acquisition framework that allows DOD officials to develop acquisition strategies and employ acquisition processes that match the characteristics of the capability being acquired. The pathway for acquiring major capabilities generally includes four phases, three of which GAO focuses on in this report: technology maturation and risk reduction; engineering and manufacturing development; and production and deployment. Programs typically complete a series of milestone reviews and other key decision points that authorize entry into a new acquisition phase, as shown in the table below. In August 2019, DOD announced that it would no longer conduct mandatory peer reviews for competitive procurements above $1 billion, except for the small number of programs for which the U.S. military departments have milestone decision authority, and other programs of special interest to DOD. As part of the same announcement, DPC stated that it planned to continue to perform peer reviews of noncompetitive procurements of $500 million or more. DPC officials expect that the procurements no longer covered by DPC's peer review will instead be covered by theMilitary departments' own review processes, which already address competitive procurement up to $ 1 billion. While these review processes exist within the military Departments, there is not an active mechanism for sharing across the departments any best practices and lessons learned—including about contract choice—found in the course of the reviews.
DOD's acquisition of weapon system programs has been on GAO's High Risk List since 1990 because DOD programs consistently fall short of cost, schedule, and performance expectations. Congress and DOD have long explored ways to curtail these problems. In 2016, DOD began to decrease the amount of cost growth in its major defense acquisition program portfolio. Congress also required DOD to establish a panel in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 to identify ways to streamline and improve the defense acquisition system. The panel issued its final report in January 2019, which, together with its earlier reports, included a wide range of recommendations aimed at changing the overall structure and operations of defense acquisition. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to implement acquisition reforms. This report addresses (1) the progress DOD has made to implement selected oversight reforms for major acquisition programs; (2) how DOD has used middle-tier acquisition pathways and the extent to which DOD has developed guidance on middle- tier program oversight; and (3) challenges DOD faces related to reform implementation. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant legislation, guidance, and policies and interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military departments, and other DOD components. The Department of Defense (DOD) has made progress implementing reforms that have affected the oversight of major defense acquisitions. Milestone decision authority for most programs now resides with the military department, a reform generally required for programs starting after October 1, 2016. In addition, new processes are in place to improve DOD's consideration of program cost, fielding and performance goals and assessment of technical risk, although questions remain about how they will be implemented. DOD also restructured its acquisition oversight functions in January 2018 in an effort to increase innovation in the earlier stages of the acquisition process and reduce cost and schedule risks in later stages. While the restructure has begun to take shape, additional steps remain to be completed, including developing charters and fully staffing new offices. These steps are important to determining how acquisition oversight roles—which had been executed by a single office for decades—will be divided and how new offices will be structured to effectively carry out their work. As of March 2019, the Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy have begun to execute over 35 unclassified and classified acquisition programs using new acquisition pathways distinct from the traditional DOD acquisition process under interim guidance issued by DOD and the departments. However, DOD has yet to determine how certain aspects of program oversight will work, including what information military departments should consider in selecting programs and what metrics and data the offices should use to assess performance. DOD faces challenges in addressing disagreements about oversight roles and responsibilities, improving portfolio management, and assessing the effectiveness of recent reforms. Senior DOD leadership has not fully addressed disagreements about the division of acquisition oversight responsibilities between the office and military departments. As a result, there have been continuing differences of opinion about how to implement specific reforms. DOD has also yet to address persistent portfolio management challenges that affect its ability to effectively manage its portfolio of weapon systems investments. For example, while DOD is revising its portfolio management directive, it has not yet determined how it will assess whether the reforms are collectively resulting in an acquisition process that is more efficient or will measure their effect on program outcomes. Lastly, DOD is beginning to monitor the implementation of certain reforms, but has not established processes to assess the overall effectiveness of its reform efforts.
The DATA Act requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to establish government-wide data standards for federal spending data. GAO was mandated to review DATA Act implementation. This report addresses (1) the timeliness, completeness, accuracy, and quality of the data submitted under the act and the implementation and use of data standards; and (2) the extent to which progress has been made to develop a data governance structure consistent with key practices, and how it affects data quality. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed agency submission files for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 (Q4 FY2018) on USAspending.gov and interviewed officials from OMB, Treasury, and other agencies. For Q4 FY 2018, 107 agencies, including all 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies and 83 non-CFO Act agencies, determined they were required to submit data or would voluntarily submit data under the DATA Act. Of these agencies, 96 submitted data. This represents an increase over the initial submissions for Q2 FY2017 when 78 agencies submitted data that covered 91 federal entities. However, not all the required data submitted by agencies were complete, and the data were not always accurate (i.e., consistent with agency source records and other authoritative sources and reporting standards). Specifically, 14 agencies submitted their data after the due date, 11 did not submit data, 2 agencies submitted incomplete data, and 2 agencies did not report data. For example, 34 agencies submitted a blank file that links budget and award information or a file containing procurement data that did not contain any data. Agencies told GAO that they submitted files without data for reasons such as confusion or miscommunication between the agency and its shared service provider about who was responsible for reporting the data; their officials had determined the agency was not required to report; new staff were unfamiliar with DATA Act requirements; technical or systems issues, such as a financial system upgrade in process, prevented them from reporting their data; and multiple agencies submitted blank files. In addition, some agencies continued to have challenges in reporting some data elements in accordance with standards. In particular, some CFO Act agency financial assistance programs did not include certain financial assistance awards that were subject to reporting in their submissions. For fiscal year 2017, 39 programs (approximately 1 percent) of the 2,926 programs were not included in the data submissions, even though these agencies stated that they made reportable awards during fiscal year2018. Based on the estimated obligations, these 39 programs account for approximately $11.5 billion in estimated annual obligations in fiscal years 2018. The omitted amounts largely resulted from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) failure to report 27 programs representing more than 99 percent of the estimated annually obligations. USDA is working on solutions to resolve identified reporting challenges with its financial and awards systems. Based upon testing of a sample of budgetary and award transactions for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 that GAO submitted to Treasury in March 2019, the overall completeness within individual transactions and accuracy of the reported data was high. Specifically, based upon GAO's sample GAO estimates with a 95 percent confidence level that all the data in the population were between 99 and 100 percent complete and between 90 and 93 percent accurate. GA OMB and Treasury have made progress in implementing the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), but more needs to be done to address continued challenges with the completeness and accuracy and the transparency of key data elements. The DATA Act required OMB to establish data standards to produce consistent and comparable data that are displayed accurately for taxpayers and policymakers. The act requires agencies to report spending data for federal programs and activities for federal agencies to be published on US aspending (USAspends.gov). GAO has issued a series of reports and made recommendations on data quality and data governance since the act's enactment in 2014, including a report in July 2018 on the quality of agencies' data submitted for Q3 FY2017 and a March 2019 report on the status of OMB's and Treasury's efforts to establish policies and procedures for governing data standards. These data quality challenges underscore the need for the agencies to make further progress on addressing a 2015 GAO recommendation that they establish clear policies and processes for developing and maintaining data standards that are consistent with leading practices for data governance. OMB has taken a number of steps to further develop data governance at both the
The Department of Defense's (DOD) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) forces provide the combatant commanders necessary capabilities for combat and combat-related missions. They also provide capabilities through their Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) missions that are important to supporting U.S. law enforcement agencies and other federal, state, and local civil authorities. The military services collectively have more than 6,300 EOD positions to fulfill combatant command missions, and demand for EOD manpower and expertise is high. GAO was asked to examine the extent to which the military services' EOD forces are prepared to support DSCA missions. This report examines (1) the processes for determining EOD personnel requirements and (2) the effect of VIP support missions on military preparedness for combat missions. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD and military service policies and guidance and interviewed DOD and service officials. DOD's process for determining the number of EOD technicians it needs to meet combatant commander requirements does not fully consider DSC a missions, such as the President's VIP support mission and its accompanying substantial workload. Specifically, the process does not consider all missions conducted by EOD units, including those that support the Secret Service's protection of the President, the Vice President, and other dignitaries. DOD policy states that when considering EOD wartime requirements, service officials should make certain that national military objectives can be accomplished using a minimum of manpower that produces maximum combat power. However, in practice, EOD and manpower officials from each of the services explained that their respective services focus on combat- related missions and do not consider the increasing demand for support missions such as VIP support, which is manpower intensive and occurs frequently. For example, the workload for VIP support can be substantial and has increased from about 248,000 man-hours in fiscal year 2007 to over 690,000 in 2017, according to the Department of the Army. In addition, the demand for and limited number of DSC A missions has resulted in a significant drawdown of E OD forces, which can adversely affect the readiness of military forces to conduct combat missions in support of combatant commands. In some instances, missions supporting civil authorities have stressed the Army's EOD capabilities, resulting in missed training and the inability to participate in exercises and activities supporting combat-Related missions. DOD has a long-standing practice of providing support to civil authorities, including EOD support, when requested in advance by specific federal agencies and approved by the appropriate DOD official. For instance, the Joint Staff has issued a Joint Staff standing execute order (EXORD) that provides guidance for the military to provide support for routine VIP missions related to the protection of dignitary officials on short notice. The Secretary of Defense-approved EXORD does not specify a requirement for the services to notify DOD stakeholders regarding the effect these missions may have on the preparedness of military units for combat. As a result, the services are not advising DOD decision makers when these missions are adversely affecting EOD preparedness to perform their primary mission.
VHA launched the same-day services initiative in 2016 to improve veterans' access to care and customer service while having minimal impact on medical centers' existing workflows. GAO was asked to review VHA's implementation of the initiative. This report examines (1) how VHA designed and set up the initiative, (2) the approaches selected VA medical centers used to implement it, and (3) the extent to which VHA has documented objectives and developed performance goals and related measures to assess the impact of same- day services on veterans' care access. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed VHA documents and interviewed VHA officials at six medical centers selected to provide variation in size, location, and complexity, among other things. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) used a five-pronged approach to design and implement its Same-Day Services Initiative (same-day service initiative). VHA leadership defined the initiative as providing veterans with access to primary and mental health care on the same day—that is, within regular business hours—at a VA medical center. VHA developed guidance to help medical centers implement the initiative and provided training to medical center staff on how to use the guidance. In addition, VHA updated its mental health policy to require that any veteran new to mental health services requesting or referred for care in person be seen the same year by a licensed independent provider to screen for and address immediate care needs. VA officials told GAO that they found the implementation of this policy to be acceptable and that their main concern was that veterans' needs were met, not necessarily how they were met. In response to the 2014 access crisis, VA launched the MyVA initiative, which was designed to transform the health care experience of veterans. In April 2016, VA introduced the My VA Access Declarations with the goal of improving access by providing veterans more control as to how they receive their health care. Two of the nine “access declarations” were intended to serve as the foundational principles for improving and ensuring access to health care, and included providing timely primary andmental health care and same-year services. V HA has not documented objectives or performance goals or related performance measures for the initiative that would enable VHA to assess its impact on veterans’ access to services. For example, while VHA primarily relies on patient experience scores and the number of appointments made on the day a veteran needs care, these measures do not provide VHA with a means to monitor progress and provide limited information on the initiative’s impact on access. Without documented objectives, performance goals, and performance measures tied to these goals, VA will continue to be limited in its ability to determine, how, if at all, the initiative has improved veterans access. In its written comments on a draft of this report, VA concurred in principle with GAOs recommendation. VA stated that its Office of Veterans Access to Care will clarify objectives and develop performance goals.
The U.S. government implements an export control system to manage risks associated with exporting sensitive items and ensure that legitimate trade can still occur. State and Commerce each control the export of items within their jurisdictions by requiring a license or other authorization to export a controlled item; vetting the parties associated with export transactions; monitoring the end-use of exports and other compliance activities; and supporting law enforcement agencies' investigations of possible violations of export control laws and regulations. In May 2018, State proposed to transfer certain firearms, artillery, and ammunition from its control to Commerce's control under proposed rules. GAO was asked to review the proposed transfer. This report assesses (1) the volume and value of firearms and ammunition export license applications reviewed by State in fiscal years 2013-2017, (2) how certain export controls differ between State and commerce, and (3) what is known about the resource implications for State andCommerce due to the proposed transfers. GA O reviewed export license data from State and the Defense Technology Security Administration, and interviewed agency officials. The Department of State (State) reviewed about 69,000 export license Applications Valued at up to $45.4 billion for Firearms, Artillery, and Ammunition from fiscal year 2013 to 2017. About 57 percent of these applications involved non-automatic or semi-automatic firearms and about 4 percent involved fully automatic firearms. The remainder involved other types of firearms such as combat shotguns, firearm attachments such as silencers and riflescopes, firearm parts and components, and technical data and defense services related to these items. The proposed rules state that some of these items would transfer to Commerce control while others would remain under State control. State's and Commerce's export controls are guided by different laws, regulations, or policies that have several different requirements for registration, licensing, end- use monitoring, congressional notification, public reporting, and enforcement. For example, the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA) requires manufacturers, exporters, and brokers of items on the United States Munitions List (USML) to register with State whereas there is no registration requirement in the law for manufacturers and exporters of items under the Commerce Control List (CCL) under Commerce's jurisdiction. The AECA also requires State to notify Congress before it can approve certain export licenses for certain items, such as firearms and artillery, which would no longer be required under the proposed rules if they are transferred to the CCL, according to Commerce officials. According to Commerce, there are several circumstances in which some exports that currently require State licenses would either require fewer or no Commerce licenses if the proposed rule changes are finalized, including multiple end-users on one license, defense services, technical data, and training in the basic operation of a firearm controlled by Commerce. Commerce officials told GAO that they believe they have sufficient resources to handle an increase in the number of license applications resulting from the transfer of items from State to Commerce. State is required by law to report to Congress annually on military assistance and military exports to the governments of each foreign country and international organization and is required to post all unclassified information from this report on the internet. To comply with this requirement, State posts an annual report that includes the aggregate dollar value and quantity of defense articles and services, by USML category, licensed to each foreign countries and international organizations, as well as data on the actual shipments occurring during the fiscal year. The report also includes an appendix that breaks out exports specifically for the USML sub-category I(a), which includes firearms components, parts, accessories, and attachments, and sub-categories I(h), which include firearms components and attachments. This reporting requirement only applies to exports of items in Category I, which are licensed by State under the AECA, but does not apply to exports in Category II, which include items controlled by the Department of Defense (DOD). This information on exports, by country, would not be available for firearms and other items from Categories I-III of the US ML after they were transferred from State's control to that of Commerce, if proposed rules are finalized. The statutory penalties available for criminal violations of Export Control Reform Act of 2018 laws are the same regardless of whether the items are on the USml and controlled by State or on the Ccl and controlled under Commerce. Criminal violations may result in fines up to$1 million and prison terms up to 20 years, or both. By contrast, civil violations can result in a fine of up
SBA administers the WOSB program to provide federal contracting opportunities for women-owned small businesses (WOSB) and economically disadvantaged women- owned small businesses in certain industries. WOSBs and EDWOSBs must be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more women who are U.S. citizens to participate in the program. In fiscal year 2017, SBA obligated about $713.3 million for contracts under the program, including about $73.5 million in set-aside contracts. GAO was asked to review SBA's oversight of the program and its implementation of changes made by the 2015 NDAA. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which SBA has implemented the three changes that the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) made to the program; (2) the status of federal contract obligations to all women- Owned Small Businesses and WOS B program set-Asides; and (3) SBAs efforts to address deficiencies GAO identified in its October 2014 report. This statement is based on GAO reports issued from October 2014 through March 2019 and selected updates conducted in May 2019. To conduct these updates, GAO reviewed SBA documents and interviewed SBA officials. As of early May 2019, the Small Business Administration (SBA) had implemented one of three changes to the Women-owned Small Business (W OSB) program that the NDAA made in 2015. SBA published a final rule in September 2015 to implement sole-source authorityauthorizing SBA to implement its own certification process for the programeffective in October 2015. The two other changes in the law had not been implemented. In addition, the law did not require that SBA eliminate the self-certification option, which allows a business to certify itself or an approved third-party national certifying entity as eligible for the W OSB program. As a result, in October 2014 GAO recommended SBA establish comprehensive procedures to monitor and assess the performance of the certifiers in accordance with their agreements with SBA and program regulations. In response to this recommendation, in 2016 SBA conducted compliance reviews of the four certifiers and found that all were generally complying with their certification agreements. However, one compliance review report described “grave concerns” that a third party certifier had arbitrarily established eligibility requirements that did not align with program regulations and used them to decline firms applications. In October 2014, in response to GAOS recommendation to implement a new certification process, in December 2015 SBA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit public comments to assist the agency with drafting a proposed rule to implement the new certification program. The advance notice requested comments on various topics, such as how well the current certification processes were working, which of the certification options were feasible and should be pursued, whether there should be a grace period for self- certifying firms to complete the new process, and what documentation should be required. Three third- party certifiers submitted comments in response, and none supported the option of SBA acting as a certifier. The three certifiers also proposed ways to improve the current system of third party certificationfor example, by strengthening oversight of certifiers or expanding their number. In March 2019, in its updated Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), SBA provided information on how staff should prepare for compliance reviews, but did not provide specific time frames for how frequently the reviews are to be conducted. In its updated 2019 SOP, which includes information on reviews of certifier monthly reports, but it does not contain information about how staff would analyze the reports or how these reports would inform SBA’s oversight of third- parties and related compliance activities such as eligibility examinations. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported in 2015 and 2018 instances in which federal contracts were awarded under ineligible industry codes, and GAO analysis indicates that this problem persists. For example, in fiscal year 2018, 3.5 percent (or about $76 million) of the $1.2 billion in federal obligations to women-Owned Small businesses for W OSBs and $232 million in federal contracts awarded under an ineligible industry code went to businesses that were not eligible to receive awards in eligible industries, and 17 of the 47 federal agencies used inaccurate industry codes in at least 5 percent of their W OSsides (representing about $25 million). S
The LDA requires lobbyists to register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives and file quarterly disclosure reports on their lobbying activities. GAO was asked to review lobbyists' compliance with disclosure requirements. This report examines the extent to which lobbyists are able to demonstrate compliance with the LDA by providing documentation (1) to support information contained on registrations and reports; (2) to identify challenges or potential improvements to compliance, if any; and (3) to describe the resources and authorities available to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (USAO), its role in enforcing LDA compliance, and any efforts it has made to improve LDA enforcement. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed a stratified random sample of 99 quarterly lobbying disclosure reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of 2017 and the first and second quarters of 2018, as well as year-end 2017 and midyear 2018 political contributions reports (LD-203). GAO also interviewed lobbyists and reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed USAO officials. The Department of Justice did not have comments on a draft of this report. Lobbyists generally demonstrated compliance with lobbying disclosure requirements as required for most new lobbying registrations from 2010 through 2018. Of the 3,618 new registrations GAO identified in the House lobbyists' disclosure database in 2017 and 2018, 92.01 percent (3,329) of them were matched to corresponding LD-2 reports filed within the same quarter as the registration. These results are consistent with the findings GAO has reported in prior reviews. For selected elements of lobbyists' quarterly disclosure disclosure reports that can be generalized to the population of lobbying reports—such as income and expenses—GAO's findings have generally been consistent from year to year. However, for some disclosure reports, lobbyists may have failed to properly disclose previously held covered positions in the executive or legislative branch, such as high-ranking agency officials and congressional staff, when first registering as a lobbyist for a new client. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (LDA) requires disclosure of positions held 20 years before the date the lobbyists first lobbied on behalf of the client. This year, 19 percent of all lobbyists may not have properly disclosed one or more covered positions as required. Some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain covered positions such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions. Most lobbying firms reported that they found it “very easy” or “somewhat easy�” to comply with reporting requirements. The U. S. Attorney’s office for the district of Columbia continues to have sufficient resources and authority to enforce compliance with LDA reporting requirements, including imposing civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance. USAO received 3,798 referrals for noncompliant lobbyists from 2009 through 2018 for failure to file required disclosure reports. About 40 percent (1,533) of the referrals are now compliant because lobbying firms either filed their reports or terminated their registrations. About 59 percent (2,250) of referrals are pending further action because USAO could not locate the lobbying firm, did not receive a response from the firm after an enforcement action, or plans to conduct additional research to determine if it can locate the firm. The remaining 15 referrals did not require action or were suspended because the lobbyist or client was no longer in business or the lobbyist was deceased. In addition, some referrals were found to be compliant when USAO receiving the referral so no action was taken.
VATCs provide transplants to eligible veterans in need of an organ transplant. VHA's National Surgery Office is charged with overseeing the VA Organ Transplant Program, including the 12 VATCs that have established specialty services to provide solid organ transplant surgery and post-operative care, in some cases in conjunction with an academic affiliate. GAO was asked to review the timeliness of transplant referrals and evaluations. This report examines (1) the extent to which the number of transplants and related allocations and spending increased from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, (2) the percentage of referrals reviewed and completed within the required time frame, and (3) the effectiveness of VA's processes for reviewing referrals and completing evaluations for potential candidates for transplantation. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed VHA data on transplant-related services provided to veterans from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018; reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and VHA policies and procedures; and interviewed VHA officials and officials from five VATCs selected based on geographic location and organ type. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provided about 1,700 organ transplants at its 10 transplant centers (VATC) between fiscal years (FY) 2014 and 2018. The number of transplant services provided each year generally increased, ranging from 300 transplants in FY 2014 to 400 in FY 2017. During this 5-year period, kidneys and livers were the most frequently transplanted organs, representing 85 percent of all organs transplanted at VATCs. Heart and lung transplants were much less common and represented the remaining transplants. For veterans who received a transplant from a VATC between FY 2014 and FY 2018, survival rates varied by organ type, with the 3-year survival rate ranging from about 95 percent for kidney to 85 percent for lung transplant recipients. Consistent with the increase in the number and cost of organ transplant services, VHA allocated and spent more than $292 million for transplant services during this period, peaking at $64.6 million in FY 2018. VA funds these services using a combination of general purpose and specific purpose funds. Transplant-related funds are used to support program overhead costs (infrastructure and maintenance) and are used for pre-transplant evaluations, lodging, and some miscellaneous costs associated with transplants, such as living donor evaluations. In addition, transplant-specific purpose funds were used to fund other VHA medical centers that perform certain transplant follow-up care. From FY 2014 through FY 2017, the majority of these funds were allocated to the VATCs for solid organ transplanted services. The percentage of veterans referred for transplant evaluation by VHA for which a full evaluation was completed within 30 days of referral increased from 55 percent to 87 percent. However, according to VA officials, in many cases, the transplant evaluation reveals that a veteran does not meet the criteria for a transplant. For example, a veteran's state of illness may not be severe enough to warrant a full transplant evaluation. In some cases, veterans who are offered transplant evaluations decide not to proceed following education about the process. Although a veteran may choose to be seen at a time beyond the 30-day standard, postponing an evaluation may delay their placement on the national organ donation waitlist, potentially having a negative impact on their health and well-being. VA officials reported that additional training for transplant coordinators would be helpful for improving evaluation timelier.
DHS established the CFATS program to protect U.S. national security and public health and safety by, among other things, identifying high-risk chemical facilities with the potential to release toxic chemicals into the environment that could cause serious injury or death. In 2013, GAO reported that DHS's risk assessment approach did not consider all of the elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence associated with a terrorist attack involving certain chemicals and recommended that DHS enhance its approach to incorporate all elements of risk and conduct an independent peer review after doing so. GAO was asked to review DHS's management of the program. This testimony discusses (1) DHS's progress and challenges in managing the program, (2) actions DHS has taken to address prior GAO recommendations, and (3) the status of DHS's efforts to implement GAO's most recent recommendations. This statement is based on GAO products issued from April 2013 through August 2018, with selected updates conducted in June 2018. To conduct these updates GAO reviewed DHS documents and interviewed DHS officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress addressing past challenges related to the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Act (CFATS) program, but some actions are still under way. In April 2013 GAO found that DHS did not have an approach for obtaining systematic feedback from facility owners and operators on the effectiveness of its outreach to them on facility security plans. In July 2015, DHS officials reported that they had identified about 1,000 additional facilities that should have reported information to comply with CFATS and subsequently contacted these facilities to ensure compliance. In October 2016, DHS developed a questionnaire to solicit feedback on facility outreach with industry stakeholders and began using the questionnaire in October 2016. In August 2017, DHS began conducting compliance inspections of facilities and issued corrective actions to two facilities that were not in compliance with their approved site security plans, and in April 2018, DHS reported that it had conducted 3,553 compliance inspections for 2,466 facilities with an approved plan as of May 2018. In addition, in April 2013, DHS revised its procedures for reviewing facilities' security plans to address DHS managers' concerns that the original process was slow, overly complicated, and caused bottlenecks in approving plans, but GAO estimated that it could take DHS another 7 to 9 years to review the approximately 3,120 plans in its queue at that time. DHS reported in its December 2016 semi-annual report to Congress that it has eliminated the backlog of plans awaiting review and that it is reviewing and approving security plans for the approximately 900 remaining facilities. DHS officials attributed the increased approval rate to efficiencies in DHS's review process, updated guidance, and a new case management system. Finally, DHS took action to implement an Expedited Approval Program (EAP) to expedite the security plan review process for facilities that had already submitted a standard security plan to DHS. In 2017, we found that, as of June 2018, only 18 of the 3,152 facilities eligible to use the EAP had opted to use it. DHS attributed the low participation to several possible factors, including that DHS had implemented the program after most eligible facilities already submitted standard (non-expedited) security plans; facilities may consider the expedited program's security measures to be too strict and prescriptive, not providing facilities the flexibility of the standard process; and the lack of an authorization inspection, which provides useful information about a facility's security. We also found in 2017 that recent changes made to CFATS could affect the future use of the expedite program. In September 2018, we reported that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed a secure interface called the Infrastructure Protection (IP) Gateway that provides access to facility-specific information that may be missing from required reporting. However, the IP Gateway is not widely used at the local level and officials from 13 of 15 selected Local Emergency Planning Committees we contacted—consisting of first responders and covering 373 CFATS high risk facilities—said they did not has access to the data in it. We recommended in September 2018 that DHS should take actions to encourage access to and wider use of this interface and explore other opportunities to improve information-sharing with first responders. DHS concurred with this recommendation and reported in August 2018 that they are taking actions to implement it. Specifically, DHS has revised three fact sheets and an outreach presentation to include information on how to request access to it and plans to ensure that contact is made with first
DOD has long recognized that the contracts for items like weapon systems are capital intensive in nature and take a long time to produce. Contract financing assists the defense contractor in managing expenses, such as material, labor, and overhead. In such cases, DOD can agree to help finance these expenses as the work progresses through various types of contract financing payments, including progress payments and performance-based payments. GAO was asked to review DOD's contract financing policies. This report examines (1) the relationship between contract financing and contractor profitability, (2) changes to the statutory and regulatory framework governing contract financing since 1985, and (3) the extent to which DOD has assessed the impact of its policies on the defense industry since 1985. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed DOD data; and interviewed DOD and industry officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) provides contract financing on fixed-price type contracts for non-commercial items. DOD provides this financing on a percentage of the cost of the contract to help the contractor manage its expenses, including costs incurred by the contractor on the basis of progress payments. Progress payments are based on the percentage of costs incurred as work progresses and are intended to provide incentives for contractor performance. In December 2016, Congress enacted Section 831 of the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to establish performance- Based Contract Financing as the preferred type of DOD contract financing in statute. The NDAA also directed the Secretary of Defense to ensure that nontraditional defense contractors and other private sector companies are eligible for these payments, in line with best commercial practices. In August 2018, DOD introduced a proposed rule that was intended to use contract financing rates to help incentivize contractor performance and to implement Section 8 31. The proposed rule would have set a base progress payment rate for large businesses (specifically, for other than small businesses) at 50 percent and small businesses at 90 percent. However, the proposed rule provided opportunities to increase the rate if the contractor achieved certain enterprise-wide priorities such as meeting contract delivery dates. DOD withdrew this rule in October 2018, citing the need to conduct additional outreach with industry regarding contract financing methods. In April 2019, DOD proposed a new rule for public comment. DOD officials indicated that they hope to issue a final rule in early 2020. Since 1985, DOD has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of the impact that its contract financing or profit policies have had on the industry since the Defense Finance and Accounting Review Institute (DFAIR) study was completed in 1985. In the intervening time, there have been significant changes in the composition of the industry, business practices, and economic conditions. For example, the industrial base has moved away from heavy industrial manufacturing toward technology and more sophisticated industry partners, including contractors who do not typically work with DOD. Industry officials also noted that the emergence of high-technology companies may pose a challenge to traditional defense contractors in terms of attracting financing and investment from commercial and private investors at competitive rates. Since the DFAIR study was issued in 1985, Congress and DOD have made a number of legislative and regulatory changes intended to reduce the administrative burden associated with contract financing. These changes included the elimination of flexible progress payments in 1999, elimination of the "paid cost rule" in 2000, and elimination of a "financial need requirement" in 2016. In addition, in 2015, DOD changed its policy to encourage the use of performance- based payments, and GAO's review of DOD's semi-annual reports to Congress found that DOD paid less in these payments after making some changes to its policies, but started increasing these payments again in 2017. DOD's Office of the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment, Defense Contract Management and Agency, Office of Management and Budget, and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy have acknowledged the need for DOD to conduct a comprehensive and systemic assessment of how its policies have affected the industry. DOD had previously stated its intent to do such an assessment on a regular basis, but did not provide a timeframe for doing so. DOD has adjusted its progress payment rates five times since 1985 but only adjusted the rate twice since 1991, when DOD indicated its intention to assess the rate annually. DOD last changed the rate in 2001. Until DOD conducts a comprehensive review and updates that review on a recurring basis, it will not be in a position to understand whether current or future policies are achieving their intended objectives.
Education's CRDC collects data on restraint and seclusion, including the number of students restrained or secluded in school. GAO was asked to review the CRDC. This report examines (1) the effectiveness of CRDC data quality control procedures, (2) how selected districts interpret CRDC definitions, and (3) selected districts' use of data and how they encourage staff to report incidents. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed CRDC restraint andseclusion data for school year 2015-16, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies; and interviewed officials in nine school districts in Kentucky, Washington, and Wisconsin, selected based on factors such as size, school type, and number of reported incidents. The Department of Education's (Education) Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a biennial survey that is mandatory for nearly every public school and school district in the United States and is conducted by Education's Office for Civil Rights. The CRDC collected data on the nation's public schools (pre-K through 12th grade) that includes the use of restraint or seclusion and student demographics and enrollment numbers, educational and course offerings, and disciplinary actions. For the 2017-18 school year, Education collected these data through an online submission tool, and GAO is not making recommendations in this report. Restraint and Seclusion: GAO identified four key issues for which Education's quality control processes for its CRDC restraints and seclusions data are largely ineffective or do not exist. First, Education's business rule to detect potentially erroneous reporting of zero incidents was largely ineffective because it applied to only 30 of the more than 17,000 school districts nationwide, rendering it largely ineffective for checking the 70 percent of districts that reported zero incidents. This is because the rule only applied to districts with over 100,000 enrolled students. However, in its January 2019 data quality review of 50 districts' data, the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) found erroneous reporting in districts of all sizes. The findings from Education's review, along with those from our analysis, suggest that misreporting is a problem among districts. Second, Education has no business rules to flag school districts that report very low or very high rates of restraint. For example, in the 30 largest school districts (those with more than100,000 students), GAO found that all of the incidents of restraint reported occurred in no more than 15 percent of a district's schools; the rest of the schools in those districts reportedzero incidents. Federal standards for internal control state that management is to determine if controls individually and in combination with other controls are capable of achieving an objective and addressing related risks. An internal control design may be deficient when a control necessary to meet an objective is missing. Without business rules or similar analytical processes to flag these outliers, they may continue to go undetected by Education and other stakeholders. Third, Education may be missing an opportunity to identify districts with disproportionately low or high incidents of seclusion or restraint to determine where technical assistance or other intervention may be warranted. Officials in all nine districts GAO visited said they used their data to reduce the incidence of restraint andSeclusion and developed strategies for improved reporting. District officials said that the data helped them identify patterns in staff and student behavior that may contribute to use of these practices, such as by identifying the circumstances under which a student's behavior tends to escalate, so that staff can strategize how to more effectively respond so as to prevent the need to use these practices. Districts also developed strategies to improve their CRDC reporting, including communicating with staff about how data are used, providing training on how to report, and developing processes that encourage reporting.
In January 2018, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released (M-18-04) Monitoring and Evaluation Guidelines for Federal Departments and Agencies that Administer United States Foreign Assistance (the “Guidelines”) in response to the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2016 (FATAA). The Guidelines provide direction to federal departments and agencies that administer foreign assistance on monitoring the use of resources, evaluating the outcomes and impacts of the foreign assistance projects and programs, and applying the findings and conclusions of such evaluations to proposed project and program design. The goals of the Guidelines are to set forth key principles to guide each agency and to specify requirements, where appropriate, that agencies must cover in their own policies on M&E of foreign assistance. GAO was asked to review OMB's Guidelines. This report examines the extent to which (1) the OMB Guidelines incorporate GAO leading practices for monitoring and evaluation and (2) agencies incorporate the Guidelines in their policies and plans. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the Guidelines against GAO's 28 leading practices identified in GAO-16-861R. Based on our review, OMB incorporates 11 of 14 of GAO’s leading practices. However, the Guidelines do not incorporate practices on developing monitoring plans that are based on risks, ensuring that staff are appropriately qualified to conduct monitoring, establishing procedures to close out programs, developing staff skills for evaluation, and following up on evaluation recommendations. OMB indicated that it intended the Guidelines to focus on elements required by the FATAA legislation. Nevertheless, incorporating these leading practices in the Guidelines can help ensure that all agencies address impediments, effectively manage foreign assistance, and meet their assistance goals. Most agencies have incorporated all of OMBs Guidelines for monitoring in their monitoring policies, but the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) did not include the requirement for agencies to conduct impact evaluations for pilot programs or to conduct performance evaluations for those programs and provide a justification for not conducting an impact evaluation. DOD officials told us they do not require this practice because they are still in the process of fully aligning their policy with the Guidelines. According to DOD, it has determined that impact evaluations are impractical and inappropriate for the planned evaluations; instead, it plans to conduct only performance evaluations and provide justifications for not conducted impact evaluations, as required. DOD plans to address the evaluation methodology of pilot programs in future updates, according to officials, but has no specific timelines in place for these updates. Agencies have taken initial steps to implement their policies. For example, the Departments of State, Defense, and Agriculture and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) have agency-wide policies for foreign assistance evaluation. USDA and HHS have policies relevant to their major foreign assistance programs.
In fiscal year 2017, the federal government provided over $68 million in tax credits to states to fund scholarships that students can use to attend private elementary and secondary schools. These tax credits are a form of forgone revenue that states may use to help students pay for tuition and other expenses. GAO was asked to review state scholarships for K-12 students. This report describes (1) key requirements state TCS programs have chosen to establish for participating private schools, (2) requirements for private schools participating in state programs, and (3) how selected states implement TCS program and how they assess whether SGOs and private schools are following key state requirements. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed state laws, regulations, and program documents and interviewed state and SGO officials in Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania, the three states with the largest scholarships awarded in 2017. The Department of Education reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Education did not comment on the report's findings. In its comments, Education provided information about the administration's tax credit proposal and made observations about how the scope of programs covered in GAO's report was both similar and different from educational programs that are addressed in the proposal. States have established requirements that private schools must follow as a condition of participation in their tax credit scholarship (TCS) programs, such as annual financial audits or reviews. All 22 programs GAO examined have financial requirements that limit the percentage of donated funds that participating schools are permitted to use for non-scholarship expenses—such as staff salaries—and most also require them to undergo annual financial audit or review. Most programs also have requirements related to student withdrawals. For example, most programs require schools to report or repay a scholarship when students withdraw from the school for which the scholarship was originally awarded. In three states GAO visited—Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Florida—SGOs are generally responsible for recruiting donors and awarding scholarships, while state agencies administer tax credits. In all three states, state agencies have a limited role—or no role at all—in determining the allocation of scholarships among eligible students. In addition, states vary in their requirements for how they prioritize eligible students, the degree to which they may work exclusively with a subset of schools, and whether they may consider donors' recommendations when deciding which students receive scholarships. Further, because each SGO is responsible for establishing its own procedures for awarding scholarships within program requirements, a program with more than one SGO could have substantial variation in how scholarships are awarded. The proportion of students who received TCS scholarships varied among the schools we visited, with one school in Florida reporting that less than one percent of students received scholarships and another school in Arizona reporting that about 80 percent of its students were awarded scholarships. All three states require tax-exempt organizations (SGO) to sign an application attesting that they will follow program requirements and regularly report donation and scholarship information. The type of information states collect and the extent to which states assess compliance with program requirements varies. In Pennsylvania, for example, state officials noted that they check that all required information is included in the application, but generally do not evaluate the content. In Arizona, the SGO manual includes optional procedures that financial auditors may use as part of their review. Pennsylvania does not require an assessment of SGO's compliance with certain program requirements. State officials in Florida described using a variety of monitoring activities to oversee participating schools, while Arizona and Pennsylvania state officials said they do not conduct ongoing monitoring activities due to the parameters of their statutory authority.
DHS relies on contracts to support its mission and operations. Service contracts accounted for over three-quarters of DHS's contract obligations in fiscal year 2018. GAO was asked to review DHS's use of service contracts. This report addresses the extent to which DHS and selected components and offices (1) used service contracts from fiscal years 2013 through 2018; (2) identified, developed, and reviewed service contract requirements; (3) ensured oversight of contracts requiring heightened management attention; and (4) considered service requirements in budgeting processes. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed a non-generalizable sample of DHS contracts awarded in fiscal years 2018 that were above the simplified acquisition threshold and were not exempt from performing a risk analysis tool used by DHS components to identify the appropriate mix of federal and contractor employees. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) obligated about $70.7 billion, or 76 percent, of its $93.8 billion in total contract obligations on services and products from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year2018. Service contract obligations increased by 40 percent from 2013 to 2018, largely driven by increases in Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) service contract obligations, which grew by $2.2 billion and $927 million, respectively. DHS and components in GAO's review have guidance and processes for identifying and developing service contract Requirements. However, DHS does not have an approach to consistently address certain service procurements, such as ensuring proposed service requirements are clearly defined and reviewed before planning how they are to be procured. For example, in 2018, DHS began piloting a DHS-wide Service Requirements Review to validate, optimize, prioritize, and approve service requirements early in the development process, but the pilot was discontinued in April 2019 before any service requirements were reviewed because it was determined to be too resource intensive, according to DHS officials. In addition, DHS has not established a process to ensure it is consistently reviewing proposed service procurement actions through the Procurement Strategy Roadmap, which is intended to review and approve the procurement strategy for all service and product acquisitions with a total estimated value over $50 million, prior to award. DHS's Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management (OCPO) subjectively waived the review for 18 of the 49 eligible procurement actions for fiscal year 2019—over 36 percent of the actions that should have been subject to the review. Federal internal control standards state that management should identify and respond to risk to achieve its objectives. Without a risk-based approach for reviewing service requirements, DHS is at risk of not consistently reviewing procurement actions that could benefit from headquarters-level review. DHS also lacks a formal process for planning and updating personnel resources needed for service contracts in need of increased management attention. Specifically, DHS and component officials GAO interviewed stated that they rely on their program and contracting officials' historical knowledge and professional judgment to determine and communicate oversight needs informally at the component level, but GAO found a lack of understanding and inconsistencies in how oversight was analyzed and documented prior to the decommissioning of the BWAT, which was used to implement DHS's Balanced Workforce Strategy, which focuses on achieving the appropriate ratio of federal employees to contractors to accomplish the department's mission, while minimizing risk to DHS's missions from an overreliance on contractors. For service contracts that are closely associated with inherently governmental, critical, or special interest functions—such as developing federal agency policy and determining price reasonableness of vendor bids—GAO found that 25 of the 75 required job aids for these functions that were awarded in 2018 either could not be provided or did not contain the information used to calculate and, therefore, plan for sufficient federal personnel to conduct oversight. For services that require enhanced management attention, DHS's job aid includes a narrative section to document mitigation strategies to ensure that the functions do not become inherently governmental or critical functions, but does not provide a place to document the federal personnel who will be tasked with conducting oversight of these functions. DHS officials stated that, as of March 2019, they use the Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions Analysis, or job aid, to identify functions that may be contracted for that require heightened oversight, but they did not provide any detail about who would be responsible for performing and overseeing the contractor employees performing the contracted functions or tasks. In the absence of this information, DHS lacks reasonable assurance that it is dedicating an adequate number of employees to oversee these functions, which places DHS at risk
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have identified two practices that can hinder generic drug companies' ability to develop and market generic drugs: (1) limiting access to samples of reference standard drugs, which generic companies generally need to conduct bioequivalence testing, and (2) delaying negotiations with generic companies on a required shared system, which is a system that is used by generic and reference drug companies to coordinate their REMS activities and information about a drug's risks. GAO was asked to review generic drug development and marketing practices. This report examines: 1) the extent to which FDA and FTC have identified practices that may hinder the development of generic drugs, and 2) the actions FDA and the FTC have taken to address these practices and the views of drug companies and stakeholders on the usefulness of these actions. To do this work, GAO analyzed FDA data on drugs subject to REMS as of March 18, 2019, the most current data available at the time of GAO's review; reviewed FDA documents; and interviewed officials from FDA, FTC, five generic and five reference drug company officials, and representatives from four generic companies that developed generic versions of drugs that are subject to the REMS. FDA reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. In recent years, FDA and FCC have identified the following two practices as hindering generic drug company development and market access: 1. Limiting access to drug samples. Some drug companies may limit access to sample drugs that they need to test, such as those subject to risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), by limiting distribution to certain health care settings. For example, some drug companies might limit the distribution of a drug subject to a REMS by limiting its distribution to only certain settings. 2. Negotiating a shared system. Some generic companies have had difficulty negotiating with reference companies to share REMS materials and administrative requirements with health care providers. FDA has taken four actions to address circumstances when generic companies cannot access samples of drug samples or experience delays in negotiating required shared systems. Three of the actions focus on making samples of drugs with REMS accessible and the fourth focuses on facilitating the development and use of shared systems for generic drugs. FDA published a web page with information on inquiries made to FDA by generic companies seeking to obtain samples ofreference standard drugs in order to develop generic drugs in February 2019. FDA officials said they published this list to increase transparency about continuing issues related to accessing samples and to raise awareness about the potential effect these issues might have on reducing competition in the drug market. According to FDA data, the number of inquiries had been generally decreasing in the years prior to when the list was published. FTC officials reviewed inquiries the agency received from FDA and generic companies and filed two briefs. However, FTC officials said, to date, they have not brought a case charging a drug company with violating federal antitrust law for refusing to provide samples to a generic company. Officials from four of the five generic companies GAO interviewed said that they had experience negotiating REMS, and three of these four companies told GAO that developing a shared systems is a difficult, challenging, and complex process. FDA issued draft guidance on how to obtain a waiver to allow generic companies to develop a separate system from the one required for a reference drug, but according to officials from three of the generic companies, it took almost a year for FDA to grant a waiver. FDA granted a waiver in 2013, allowing the generic company to develop its own separate system that includes the same REMS measures required for the reference drug. The remaining two generic companies did not have comments on the topic. In addition, officials from one generic company said that it was too early to tell whether FDA's published web page was useful.
The F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, is DOD's most costly and ambitious aircraft acquisition, costing an estimated $396 billion to develop and field over 1,457 aircraft. It is intended to replace hundreds of existing aircraft and is expected to replace or modernize hundreds of legacy aircraft and support a wide range of military operations and national security missions. In fiscal year 2019, DOD plans to spend about $392 billion on the program, including about $10.5 billion for Block 4, which will add new capabilities and modernize the aircraft to address evolving threats. GAO was asked to testify on the status of the program. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing review of the F- 35 program. It addresses the extent to which the program has (1) developed a business case to inform Block 4 development contracts, (2) made progress in meeting reliability and maintainability targets, and (3) addressed sustainment and supply chain challenges. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed DOD and contractor officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) plans to award development contracts for the next-generation Joint Strike Lightning II (F-35) aircraft in May 2019, at least five months before any of the critical Block 4 business case documents that would normally inform this decision are available. The program has made slow, consistent progress in improving reliability and maintenance (R&M) performance, but half of the R&M metrics are not achieving targets. All F-15s are generally performing near or above targets for four of the eight R and M metrics, while still falling short for the other four. In December 2018, the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation reported that, although performance for the four under-performing metrics has shown slow growth over the years, none of these metrics are meeting interim goals needed to reach requirements at each variant's maturity. According to program officials, the program office has not prioritized or dedicated funding in its budget to improve R andM, in part because program officials explained that they were focused on initiatives intended to lower the cost of the aircraft. In addition, any current funding for R & M improvement projects comes from the program's operation and maintenance funds, which are only available for one fiscal year. By not defining objectives in its RMIP guidance for meeting all eight R &M metrics, aligning which improvement projects will ensure those metrics are met, and prioritizing funding for those projects, DOD is at risk of not fully meeting its R& M targets. As a result, the warfighter may accept aircraft that are less reliable than originally planned, and whose operation and sustainment costs may raise affordability questions. The Air Force recently identified the need to cut sustainment cost—by 43 percent in the case of the Air Force—to improve affordability in sustainment. In April 2019, in response to a recommendation from GAO, DOD agreed to take steps to improve communication with the services and provide more information about how F-5 sustainment charges relate to the capabilities received. In October 2017, in an effort to improve affordability, the military services established a Chief Architect position to manage the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS)—a multi-sensor, resilient battle management system intended to provide a more robust and survivable air, land, and sea system that can operate in contested environments. The ABMS is early in the acquisition process, as the specific capabilities and overarching acquisition strategy are still to be determined by the Army and Air Force. In July 2018, DOD's Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the ABMS Initial Capabilities Document—which describes capability needs and associated gaps—which was approved by the Joint Staff in July 2018. The first phase of ABMS began in fiscal year 2018 and will last through 2023, with an initial operational capability planned for 2035. Air Force officials have reported that the third phase, planned for the mid-2030s, will provide multi-Sensor, resilience battle management command and control capability using multiple types of communications methods, with a cost of $3.8 billion.
DOD's civilian acquisition workforce is vital to maintaining military readiness, increasing the department's buying power, and achieving substantial long-term savings through activities such as systems engineering and contract administration. GAO has previously found that DOD has faced various challenges in growing and sustaining its acquisition workforce, including challenges with hiring, recruiting, and retaining personnel. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of hiring flexibilities for the acquisition workforce. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has monitored and assessed its use of available hiring, recruitment, and retention flexibilities, and (2) factors that affect the use of these flexibilities. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant statutes, reports, and DOD policies and guidance; analyzed personnel data for fiscal years 2014 through 2018; and interviewed DOD officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) has increased its use and oversight of hiring and recruitment flexibilities to recruit and retain its civilian acquisition personnel. From fiscal year 2014 to 2018, DOD increased the amount of funds authorized for recruitment and retention incentives from $13.9 million to $33.7 million and increased the number of incentives awarded by 140 percent. DOD leadership has emphasized the benefits of these incentives and has encouraged their use. For example, in October 2016, the Secretary of Defense issued an acquisition workforce strategic plan that emphasized the importance of using hiring flexibles, particularly direct hire authorities, as appropriate. However, DOD does not regularly monitor the military departments' and defense components' use of the hiring and recruiting flexibilities and, as a result, is missing opportunities to identify variations in usage rates, which are significant. In fiscal year 2018, the Air Force and Navy used direct hiring authorities twice as often as the Army, while the Army used them for 42 percent and 85 percent of its hiring actions, respectively. In addition, while DOD has emphasized that using hiring Flexibilities improves DOD's ability to recruit high-quality talent in a timely manner, DOD is not yet able to assess how effective the flexibilities have been in achieving these goals. This is because DOD has not yet developed a plan to consistently measure how long it takes to hire new personnel across the department, and it has not established metrics to assess the quality of the new personnel DOD hires. DOD has efforts underway to address these issues and plans to start using these metrics in 2019. DOD's acquisition workforce challenges are not unique within the federal government. In 2008, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) established a roadmap for the traditional hiring method, which generally requires agencies to screen applications against minimum qualification standards, apply selection priorities such as veterans' preference, and assess applicants' relative competencies or knowledge, skills, and abilities against job-related criteria to identify the most qualified applicants to fill a position. The traditional method of hiring has been characterized by federal agencies as rigid and lacking in flexibility, such as flexibility to hire individuals who possess unusually high or unique qualifications or who fill essential needs for the agency. To help federal agencies address some of the human capital challenges federal agencies face, statutes have provided flexibilities that provide agencies with tools to help manage their workforces, including hiring. These flexibilities can help the government fill critical skills gaps or achieve certain public policy goals such as employing veterans. As of September 2018, we identified 46 hiring flexabilities that DOD could use to hire acquisition workforce personnel, including the following: DOD Direct Hire Authorities. These authorities help expedite the hiring process by allowing DOD to hire candidates without regard to certain provisions in Title 5 of the U.S. Code. Veterans-Related Hiring Authorities. Agencies may appoint eligible veterans without competition under limited circumstances or otherwise through excepted service hiring procedures. Pathways Programs. These programs promote employment opportunities for students and recent graduates through an exception to the competitive hiring rules for certain positions in the federal workforce. Recruitment and Retention Flexibilities. DOD can offer recruitment bonuses, relocation bonuses, retention bonuses, and student loan repayments to attract and retain personnel. These incentives are intended to help agencies attract, recruit, and retain highly qualified personnel, and allow agencies more control over compensation to help them compete with the private sector. For fiscal year 2017, DOD used these incentives for approximately 44,000 hiring actions.
The Air Force and Navy aviation depots perform depot maintenance for fixed-wing aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and aerial refuelers. GAO was asked to review aviation depot maintenance timeliness. Senate Report 115-262 accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to examine DOD's aviation maintenance depots and operations. This report examines the extent to which (1) the Navy and Air Force completed selected fixed- wing aircraft maintenance on time from fiscal years 2014 through 2019, and (2) they accurately planned for depot maintenance requirements for selected aircraft and addressed any associated challenges. To do this work, GAO selected a non-generalizable sample of 18 Air Force (F/A-18A-D Hornet) and 18 Navy (T-6B Texan II Turboprop) aircraft based on information from DOD and GAO maintenance data and prior work. These aircraft had maintenance completed at the Navy's three Fleet Readiness Centers and the Air Force's three Air Logistics Complexes from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2019. For the selected aircraft in GAO's review, the Navy completed depot maintenance an average of 52 percent of the time on time or early in the same period. The Air Force, on the other hand, completed on-time or early maintenance of the aircraft on average 82 percent of time. The Navy completed maintenance on average nearly 55 days late per aircraft in the 6 fiscal years GAO reviewed. A range of factors, such as unexpected repairs and aircraft operating beyond their designed service life, have affected Air Force or Navy depot maintenance performance. For example, Navy officials stated that they had to manage aircraft production delays related to the F-35 Lightning II, which was scheduled to replace the F/a-18D fighters, which were operating longer than originally planned. Navy officials explained that they have implemented a variety of strategies to improve on- time maintenance. These initiatives primarily focus on mitigating or reducing maintenance delays in the year of execution. Both services have initiatives underway to improve planning for aviation maintenance, but GAO identified several planning challenges that the Navy has not fully addressed. First, Navy depot planners do not have visibility into aircraft maintenance that is performed outside the depots by an operational unit or at an intermediate maintenance facility--information critical to planning for the condition and depot maintenance needs of individual aircraft. Second, while the Navy conducts annual and mid-year workload planning meetings, it does not have formal processes and related guidance for communication and coordination between depot stakeholders to ensure they receive input from all key subject-matter experts to inform maintenance planning. Without addressing these challenges, the Army and Navy may continue to experience maintenance delays that reduce the time aircraft are available for operations and training.
Energy resources on tribal lands present an opportunity for individual tribes that pursue development of these resources to improve their socioeconomic status by generating income, jobs, and associated economic development. The federal government, as a significant energy consumer, is in a position to support energy development on these lands. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) authorizes federal agencies to give preference to majority tribally owned energy suppliers over other potential energy suppliers when purchasing energy. GAO was asked to review the federal government's efforts to support tribal energy development. This report examines (1) the extent to which GSA, DOD, and DOE have used the tribal energy preference since its establishment and (2) factors that have the potential to limit federal government energy purchases from tribal sources, and suggestions to address some of these factors. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance, and interviewed federal officials, tribal representatives, and stakeholders. Since EPACT05 was enacted in 2005, the General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Defense (DOD), and Department of Energy (DOE) have not entered into an energy contract with a tribe using a tribal energy source. GSA has primary authority to enter into federal energy contracts for federal agencies, and it has delegated this authority to DOD and DOE as well, by regulation. In addition to these statutory and regulatory authorities, the acquisition and supply of energy for these agencies is governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which is issued and maintained by the federal acquisition regulatory council. The process GSA and DOD have prescribed for entering into federal contracts varies by location, depending on market conditions and state law. In traditional energy markets, retail customers such as GSA are typically required to contract with the local utility operating in the area for energy. In deregulated markets, these agencies publicly issue requests for proposals for energy, and energy providers engage in a competitive bidding process for federal contracts. Federal officials and tribal representatives GAO interviewed identified a number of factors that could limit federal energy purchases, including requirements to purchase from monopoly utilities, difficulty entering the market at the prevailing rate, lack of access to transmission infrastructure, access to capital, and lack of technical capacity. For example, according to GSA officials, federal agencies are generally required to purchase energy from the local monopoly utility in that region, which prevents them from purchasing energy from tribes. Tribal representatives and stakeholders said that federal agencies may have the option to purchase electricity as wholesale customers in traditional markets if the entity is large enough, which would allow them to purchase power from sources such as the tribal corporation. However, federal agency officials told GAO that purchasing energy as a wholesale customer may not be in the best interest of the government, given the associated technical requirements, including connecting to the grid in ways GSA is not currently equipped for, and regulatory risk, such as managing power in a way not required of retail customers. Additionally, DOE officials said there might be cost considerations related to achieving and maintaining wholesale customer status as well as risks in giving up retail customer status, including the loss of the utility's obligation to service the agency's facilities because it is no longer a retail customer. In response to GAO's November 2016 recommendations, DOE issued agency-specific guidance in 2013 on how to use the preference, and GSA added the preference language to the form it uses to delegate purchasing authority to other federal agencies that may seek this authority in the future. DOE distributed the guidance through a February 2013 acquisition letter, but GAO found that officials responsible for purchasing energy in five of nine DOE offices were unaware of the DOE guidance. DOE headquarters officials stated that the agency did not take further action to communicate the guidance or ensure relevant officials were aware of it after its initial distribution. Under federal standards for internal control, management should internally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. DOE officials agreed that officials should be aware of the guidance and the preference. By communicating the guidance to all DOE officials, DOE will be better positioned to ensure that these officials are aware, which may increase the preference's use.
This testimony discusses the Veterans Benefits Administration's (VBA) oversight of contractors that perform veterans' disability compensation exams. In 2018, GAO reported that VBA relied on contractors to perform an increasing number of these exams, which can result in delayed or inadequate exams for veterans. GAO was asked to testify on the status of VBA's oversight of these contractors. This testimony is based on GAO's 2018 report (GAO-2019) that examined (1) the extent to which VBA has accurate and up-to-date information on individual contractor performance to ensure veterans receive quality and timely exams and that contractors are properly paid, as well as a mechanism to asses overall performance of the contract; and (2) how VBA ensures that contracted examiners are trained to conduct these exams in a manner that results in accurate exam reports that claims processors can use to make a disability ratings decision. To conduct this work, in 2018 GAO reviewed VBA documents and interviewed VBA officials. VBA relies on its contractors to provide veterans with disability compensation for service-connected disabilities according to the severity of the disability. As such, it is important that the agency ensures proper oversight of its contractors. Specifically, VBA needs to ensure that it has accurate, up- to-date, and timely information on each contractor's performance and that examiners' training is completed in a timely manner. In the absence of such information, VA may not be able to accurately assess contractor performance or determine if it should reduce payment to a contractor for exams that need to be corrected or clarifications, as called for in contracts. Without sustained oversight, VA also runs the risk of causing undue harm to veterans through delayed and inadequate exams. V BA has not fully resolved issues in collecting information on contractors' quality and timeliness, which continues to hinder its ability to oversee contractor performance. For example, in November 2018, VA officials stated that they had not completed the quarterly reports that summarize how each contractor performed, which meant that VA had not administered other provisions of the contracts, such as the ability to use performance data to determine how to allocate exams within specified areas in the United States that have two contractors; in particular, VA could decide to allocate more exams to the contractor with higher performance results. In addition, VA has not yet finalized any quality scores, or completed quarterly performance reports, under the new contracts. As a result, according to VBA, it has not administered financial incentives linked to performance. To address the inaccurate timelness data, VA's new exam management system, implemented in spring 2018, was designed to capture information that would allow VBA to accurately calculate contractor timelier. However, as of September 2019, VA reported that it had not been able to fully implement its plan for using the new system to improve oversight and did not provide a target completion date for fully implementing its recommendation. In particular, V BA had not yet implemented an automated invoicing system that it plans to use to validate the accuracy of contractors' invoices nor had it reconciled historical data in the exam management systems. According to VA, the delay in implementation is, in part, a result of having to fix technical issues with exam scheduling requests and an ongoing effort involving multiple VA offices to align VA's systems with those of multiple contractors. VA also has not finalized a system to verify that all examiners have completed required training, as GAO previously recommended. As of July 2019, after VBA determined that none of the contractors were comprehensive in reporting all training, the agency started conducting random audits of contractor training records. VCA is still in the process of developing a centralized training system to collect information on all training completed by contracted examiner and to obtain participant feedback on each course.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for promoting the development of a robust, qualified, and diverse aviation maintenance workforce to integrate new technologies, such as avionics and composite materials, into the nation's air transportation system. FAA's strategic plan states the agency's focus on promoting a workforce with the skills and knowledge to integrate these technologies. GAO was asked to provide information on FAA's workforce development efforts. This testimony addresses (1) the number of FAA-certificated mechanics and repairmen and (2) the extent to which federal and industry programs support aviation maintenance careers and (3) the status of FAA's efforts to revise its curriculum requirements for aviation maintenance schools and mechanic testing standards. This statement is based on GAO's recent report, Aviation Maintenance Workforce: Federal and Industry Programs Support Workforce Development, GAO-2020 (GAO- 2020). GAO analyzed FAA data on the number and characteristics of FAA mechanics and service technicians and interviewed FAA officials, employers, and aviation industry stakeholders. FAA has acknowledged that it needs to make changes to its aviation maintenance curriculum requirements and testing standards to promote a skilled workforce. In October 2015, FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with the stated goal of updating the existing curriculum for aircraft maintenance schools. FAA issued a supplemental NPRM in April 2019 that expanded the scope of the NPRM it issued in October 2015. As of October 2019, FAA officials said they were in the process of reviewing the comments. FAA officials told GAO that a final rule will be published some time toward the end of 2020. In a separate effort outside of the rulemaking process, FAA is currently updating the testing standards for mechanics. FAA acknowledged that current mechanic testing Standards are also outdated. As a result, aviation stakeholders have stated the mechanic tests include outdated or irrelevant questions. For example, the practical test may include projects on wood airframes and fabric coverings, which are not common to modern commercial aircraft. An FAA official noted that any delay in finalizing the rule would likely result in a corresponding delay in the release of the updated standards. Delaying the update of the standards could result in the prolonged use of outdated questions on the tests. FAA is also revising the curriculum requirements that schools must meet to be eligible to participate in the AMT school pathway, which is the most common pathway certificated individuals used to qualify for the FAA tests to become mechanics. The current curriculum requirements do not emphasize commonly used modern aircraft technologies, and FAA has attempted several times to revise these requirements through the rulesmaking process. FAA and industry stakeholders have noted several challenges to updating the curriculum, including competing demands at the department level and the extent of comments FAA has received from stakeholders in response to proposed changes. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 included a provision for GAO to report on the potential for a labor shortage in aviation maintenance, and GAO found that two of the three selected labor market indicators (unemployment rate and wage earnings) GAO reviewed from 2013 through 2018 were consistent with difficulties in hiring aircraft mechanics or service technicians, while the other indicator (employment) was not. Federal agencies such as the Department of Defense, Department of Labor, and Department of Veterans Affairs administer grants or programs that support individuals pursuing aviation maintenance career or facilitate coordination among different stakeholders to support them. In addition, FAA established an Aviation Workforce Steering Committee in February 2019, in part to coordinate efforts across FAA to address various workforce related provisions included in the FAA reauthorization bill.
In April 2018, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) began referring a greater number of individuals apprehended at the border for criminal prosecution, including parents who were apprehended with children, for prosecution under the Attorney General's “zero tolerance” policy. In June 2018, a federal court ordered that certain separated parents be reunited with their children, and in July 2018 the court approved reunification procedures for class members. GAO was asked to provide information on family separations at the southwest border. This statement addresses (1) the number of children separated from their parents at the Southwest Border and (2) the extent to which HHS and DHS took steps in advance of the June 26, 2018, court order to reunify separated children with their parents. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing review of family separation issues at the southwestern border. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed officials from DHS, HHS, and other federal agencies involved in the care and custody of unaccompanied alien children (UAC). GAO also interviewed staff at four UAC shelters in Arizona and Texas selected to provide a range of ages and locations, among other things. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and Department of Justice's (DOJ) UAC shelter and field staff told GAO that they were aware of increased separations of parents and children, but did not take specific steps to plan for them because they did not receive advance notice of the April 2018 Attorney General memo that directed DOJ prosecutors to accept all referrals of all improper entry offenses from DHS for prosecution, to the extent practicable. According to ORR officials, the percentage of children who were known to have been separated from parents rose by more than tenfold from November 2016 to August 2017 (0.3 to 3.6 percent). In addition, the ORR shelter and staff GAO interviewed at four ORR facilities stated that they started noticing an increase in the numbers of separated children in late 2017 and early 2018, prior to the June 2018 court order. In response to a June 2018 federal court order, the government identified 2,654 children of potential class members in the Ms. L. v. ICE case as of September 10, 2018. As of January 31, 2019, this litigation was ongoing. The government has also reported that 79 of the children it initially identified as separated had not been separated. Excluding those 79 children from the 2,816 total would bring the total number of child separated to 2,737, according to the government. The court order required the government to reunite class members under 5 years of age within 14 days of the order, and for children age 5 and over, within 30 days. Prior to June 2018 the government planned to reunification using its standard procedures for placing unaccompanied children with sponsors. However, the agency realized that it would be difficult to meet the court's reunification deadlines and began developing a process for court approval that would expedite reunification for class member parents. The reunification process was refined and evolved iteratively based on multiple court hearings and orders. On July 10, 2017, the court issued an order approving standard procedures that included determining parentage and determining whether a parent is fit to take care of the child or presents any danger to the child. In July 2018, after the June 20 executive order and court order for reunifying families, ORR began using a new check box in the UAC Portal to indicate whether a child was separated as a result of being separated from a parent, and issued guidance to Border Patrol agents to use this check box when making referrals for referrals as of July 6, 2018 (see GAO-19-163 ). Prior to this change, the Portal did not include a check box to indicate that a child had been separated, and prior to this time, Border Patrol did not have a way to indicate if the child was being referred for referral for referral. ORR also updated its data systems in the spring and summer of 2018, but it is too soon to know whether these changes, if fully implemented, will consistently indicate when children were separated from the parents or help reunify families, if appropriate.
Aviation maintenance workers are critical to maintaining a safe and robust aviation system and meeting the growing demand for air travel. Current training and skills requirements for these workers are also important because of changing flight technology. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the development of the aviation maintenance workforce. This report examines (1) the number of FAA-certificated mechanics and repairmen and (2) the extent to which federal data provide information on the current workforce and potential future demand for this workforce. GAO analyzed FAA and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on aviation maintenance workers from 2013 through 2018; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; and interviewed federal officials, industry stakeholders, and industry employers. As of December 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that about 295,000 individuals held a mechanic certificate and about 35,000 held a repairman certificate. The median age of these certificate holders was 54 years old, according to GAO's analysis of FAA data. In comparison, about 23 percent of the overall workforce was age 55 or over according to BLS data as of 2018. FAA data also show that 3 percent of all aviation maintenance certificate holders were women. FAA's strategic plan states that the agency's focus is on promoting a robust, qualified, and diverse workforce. However, GAO found that FAA does not routinely analyze, collect, or coordinate with other stakeholders on certain related data. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve its objectives, and GAO identified several areas in which improved data analysis, collection, or coordination could assist FAA in measuring progress and understanding how to target its resources in support of its workforce-related objectives. For example, FAA collects certain demographic data on its certification application, such as the age and sex of individuals; however, FAA currently uses these data only to determine eligibility and issue certificates. These data could also be used to identify patterns or relationships, which could be useful information as FAA aims to increase opportunities for women to pursue aviation maintenance careers. FAA also maintains mechanic pathway data, but these data do not provide a complete picture of certificated individuals' education, training, and work experience due to certain data limitations. FAA has proposed changing its curriculum requirements for aviation maintenance schools and its mechanic testing standards, but has not yet issued a final rule to update these requirements. FAA officials said the current curriculum requirements do not emphasize commonly used modern aircraft technologies. As a result, FAA has attempted several times to revise them through the rulemaking process. FAA is also updating the testing standards for mechanics, which were last revised in 2015, and has stated that the revised standards will provide a comprehensive framework for the mechanic tests and serve as a guide for reviewing and revising the oral and written test questions and the practical projects.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances health care services for certain low-income individuals and families through fee-for-service payments to hospitals and managed care plans. In fiscal year 2017, Medicaid spending on hospital uncompensated care totaled about $70 billion, and states made about $30.4 billion in supplemental payments, including $18.1 billion in DSH payments, to hospitals that serve a high proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries and uninsured low- income patients. GAO was asked to review the use of supplemental payments. This report examines (1) the extent to which states' supplemental payments have changed over time, and (2) how states have financed their nonfederal share of these payments. To do this work, GAO analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers the Medicaid program; reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and prior GAO work; and interviewed officials from CMS, state Medicaid agencies, and hospitals in the 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as officials from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research and consulting organization. In recent decades, states' use of Medicaid supplemental payments has grown, partly due to the flexibility supplemental payments provide states. For example, in fiscal year 2006, states made at least $6.3 billion in non-DSH payments, though the exact amounts are unknown, because states did not report all their payments to CMS. By 2017, the amount of such payments had increased to $30 billion. In addition, between fiscal years 2011 and 2018, the number of states making at least one base payment reduction to hospitals grew from 13 to 34, while the number increasing at least 1 base payment fell over the same period. The number of hospitals receiving supplemental payments grew from 18 to 61 in five states in 2018. States have relied on multiple sources of funds to finance the nonf federal share of hospital supplemental payments in recent years, such as taxes levied on health care providers and local government funds. In particular, the total number of provider taxes increased from 119 taxes in 42 states in 2008 to 159 taxes in 47 states in 2012—a 34 percent increase—and this trend has continued. According to state survey data, states using inpatient hospital provider taxes has steadily increased from fiscal year 2011 to 2018, ranging from a low of 34 states in 2011 to a high of 42 in 2017 and 2018. In 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) allowed states to expand Medicaid eligibility to certain non-pregnant, non-elderly individuals. PPACA also required a phased reduction in Dedicated Savings Hospital (DSH) allotments to states, reflecting the expectation that hospital spending would decline—and so would hospital spending on uncompensate care. Congress has delayed this reduction several times, but the reductions are scheduled to begin in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, and have not yet taken effect. In 2016, PPACA authorized nearly $38.7 billion in total DSH spending nonconsecutively over 2011 to 2022 in four states with the largest DSH programs. The amount of DSH funding each state may claim for DSH is limited by federal law, and since 1993, each state is subject to a federal DSH allotment that establishes the maximum federal funding available for the payments. The federal government also matches a state's Medicaid payments for which the federal government will match spending, but states are not required to do so. In 2017, states received about $18 billion in Medicaid non- DSH payments—lump-sum payments that are made in addition to their base payments—to hospitals and other providers, including state-operated psychiatric hospitals. The amounts of these supplemental payments varied significantly across states in 2014, with New York making the largest amount—$3.5 billion—and Wyoming making the smallest amount (less than $500,000). GAO's prior work has highlighted a number of concerns about the state's use of Supplemental Payments from various perspectives, highlighting the need for transparent reporting, ensuring expenditures meet Medicaid purposes, and concerns regarding arrangements that shift costs from the states to the federalgovernment. In 2012, 2012, 2014, and 2018 GAO recommended that Congress consider requiring CMS to improve the transparency of and accountability for supplemental payments by requiring facility-specific payment reporting and annual audits. CMS announced in fall 2018 that it was planning a proposed rule on supplemental payments that, if finalized, would improve transparency
FAA is responsible for overseeing the safety of all U.S. commercial airports. Runway and taxiway safety has long been a focus of FAA efforts, and the agency has taken steps to improve safety in the terminal area, which includes runways, taxiways, and ramp areas. GAO was asked to review FAA's oversight of terminal area safety. This report examines (1) how FAA uses data to analyze runway incursions and (2) the extent to which FAA, airports, and airlines have implemented efforts to address safety in terminal area areas. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FAA data on runway and taxiways incidents and interviewed FAA officials and airport and airline industry stakeholders. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) uses data from reports and investigations to analyze some terminal area incidents, but does not analyze data on ramp area incidents. FAA's Runway Safety Program Manager said that FAA has not analyzed most ramp incidents because the risk of these incidents is lower than that in other areas, such as runways and therefore does not merit analysis. However, FAA is better positioned to take steps to analyze ramp incidents. Federal internal control standards state that data should be appropriate, current, complete, and accurate. In addition, FAA's Safety Management System (SMS) calls for FAA to use a data-driven approach to analyze safety risks so that it can control that risk. As part of those efforts, FAA began the rulemaking process in 2010 to require airports to implement SMS, through which airports would analyze risks in runway, taxiway, and ramps, but as of August 2019 this rule had not been finalized. Although some airport officials GAO interviewed said they are voluntarily implementing SMS and could be collecting data on ramps, FAA—with its role in overseeing safety at all commercial airports—is better positioned than individual airports to analyze such incidents. For example, an individual airport implementing SMS would analyze ramp areas incidents at that airport, but FAA could analyze them and identify trends across hundreds of airports as it does for other terminal areas. Beginning to analyze incidents in ramp areas would provide FAA with information necessary to mitigate these incidents and ensure that it is directing its efforts to the riskiest parts of the terminals. FAA and airports, airlines, and others have implemented multiple efforts, including technologies, to improve runway, taxi Way, and Ramp Safety; FAA's efforts, which focus primarily on runway safety, include developing national and regional runway safety plans, analyzing data on incidents, and helping local air traffic control managers organize annual meetings to discuss runway safety issues. FAA is also working with airports and airlines to identify and mitigate areas of airport runways or taxiways that do not meet current FAA airport design standards and have high incursions rates. FAA has also worked with industry stakeholders to develop training for air traffic controllers to mitigate incursions, which occur when an aircraft veers off the side or end of a runway, and can result in serious injury, death, or property damage. FAA also works with airlines and airports to improve ramp area safety by, among other things, using technologies to increase air traffic controller, pilot, and vehicle operator awareness of their surroundings. While FAA has taken some steps to assess the effectiveness of many of its efforts, it has not assessed the effectiveness and has not developed a plan to do so. FAA officials told GAO that they believe that the assessments described above are sufficient, based on the availability of agency resources. FAA may be missing opportunities to improve its terminal-area safety efforts. Specifically, FAA does not have a process to eliminate all duplicates from its excursion data, which FAA began collecting in 2013, and does not know how many duplicate records there are, and has no automated way to identify (and remove) all duplicate records. Further, despite containing possible duplicates, FAA recently began using these excursions data in its new surface safety metric, which is intended to measure the relative risk of incursions. Federal standards for internal control call for data to be appropriate and accurate, and a 2017 FAA internal analysis noted the importance of identifying duplicates in order to ensure accurate runway excursions.
OCWR is responsible for advancing the safety, health, and workplace rights of employees and employers in the legislative branch. The Reform Act of 1995 required OCWR to update how it carries out its responsibilities, such as offering an electronic option for filing Administrative Dispute Resolution (ADR) claims and conducting a workplace climate survey of legislative branch employees. To meet these new requirements, OCWR developed new procedures, trained and hired staff, and balanced new responsibilities with existing ones. GAO was asked to review OCWR's implementation of the Reform Act's new requirements. This report addresses (1) the status of OCWRs efforts to address new Reform Act requirements and (2) how OCWR is incorporating key management practices to implement these requirements. To do this work, GAO reviewed OCWR documents and interviewed OCWR officials and a nonprobability sample of key stakeholders and officials from offices covered by the act. The Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (OCWR) has implemented three of the four requirements that generally became effective on June 19, 2019 (see table). OCWR implemented a secure electronic system to file claims, appointed a confidential advisor, and established a permanent records retention program. However, as of October 2019, it had not fully implemented the other three requirements, which have varying deadlines, time frames, and effective dates extending beyond June 2019. OCWR has taken interim steps to establish a permanent record retention program, including changing its records retention policy in November 2017 to make all records permanent, hiring a contractor in May 2019 to scan paper records and store them electronically, and hiring another contractor in September 2019 to help develop its records retain program. In addition, OC WR is implementing new reporting requirements for tracking and reporting data and assessments. For example, it has issued a one-time report on awards and settlements previously paid, which OCWR plans to issue by January 31, 2020, and subsequent reports annually. OC WR also plans to use SOCRATES data to assess the effectiveness of ADR procedures in resolving claims in a timely manner and to publish these assessments in semi-annual reports to Congress. OCWr has also taken steps to update various education and training materials, including creating a new workplace rights brochure and redesigning a poster notifying employees of rights, protections, and procedures under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (CAA) and establishing audio and visual teleconferencing access for out-of-area employees (i.e., employees in elected officials district and state offices). GAO found that OCWR could better incorporate key management Practices to Improve the Ongoing Implementation of Reform Act Requirements. Specifically: OCWR did not consistently incorporate key practices for implementing some requirements and opportunities exist to improve the remaining implementation and administration of reforms. For instance, while OCWR established an overall project schedule with interim milestones and time frames for revising procedural rules, part of the requirement to manage changes to the ADR process, it did not use schedules to manage the implementation of other requirements such as developing the workplace survey. In general, project schedules provide a detailed plan for delivering products, services, and results and serve as a communication tool for managing stakeholder expectations. In some cases, OCWI has ongoing cybersecurity activities and planned upgrades to other information technology (IT) systems, but has not yet established project schedules for them. Moving forward, it will be important for OC WR to establish project schedules to help manage IT projects and allow key stakeholders to monitor OC WR's progress. In its strategic planning process OCWR needs to clearly articulate how its IT initiatives support its organizational goals, including how the electronic claims reporting system supports a more efficient and effective ADR program, and evaluate its human capital management strategies to ensure that it can recruit and retain staff with the appropriate skills to plan and manage its IT projects.
The federal government collects royalties on oil and gas produced from leases leased on federal lands and waters and distributes these royalties to states, Indian tribes, and the U.S. Treasury. In fiscal year 2017, the Department of the Interior's Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) collected about $5 billion in royalties. GAO was asked to review ONRR's royalty compliance program. This report examines (1) the extent to which ONRR met its compliance goals for fiscal years 2010 through 2017, and (2) how ONRR selected compliance cases for audits and compliance reviews and assessed whether these cases aligned with the agency's compliance goals. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed ONRR documents and interviewed ONRR officials. The Department of Interior (Interior) reported generally meeting its annual royalty compliance goals—those from Interior's strategic plan and bureau-specific goals—for fiscal years2010 through 2017. However, its goals may not align with its mission to ensure the accuracy of royalty payments and other statutory requirements. For example, ONRR does not have a goal for, or data on, the amount of royalties subject to its differing levels of compliance activities—audits, compliance reviews, and data mining—which provides varying levels of assurance that royalties are accurately paid. By establishing a goal (e.g., identifying the number of companies or percentage of royalties that are subject to compliance activities over a set period of time) that aligns with the mission and tracking the extent that each of its compliance activities contributes toward this goal, ON RR would have greater assurance that its compliance program has the capability to accurately determine royalties. The agency's process to select compliance cases—that is, companies or properties to undergo compliance reviews or audits—for audits and reviews is not documented. In addition, the agency has no performance measures for determining whether the way such cases are selected aligning with its goals. By developing performance measures that assess whether the agency is selecting cases that are helping it achieve its goals, ONRRR would be able to better monitor its performance in achieving its goals and whether changes to its selection process affect performance. ONRR has developed a model that assesses the risk of noncompliance for companies and properties to inform its compliance case selections, but it is unclear whether use of the model has improved case selection because it has not analyzed the model's effect on such selections. By periodically analyzing whether the model is effectively identifying potential royalty noncompliance and whether it is being effectively used to assist in case selection, and making changes to the model or developing a new model based on this analysis, ONRBR would be better able to determine how to proceed with using risk analysis to inform case selections. The nine states that are members of the State and Tribal Royalty Audit Committee (STRAC) have agreements with ONRR to conduct compliance activities for federal lands in their respective states. STRAC members reported that they are satisfied with ON RR's coordination on compliance activities but do not have documented processes for selecting compliance cases, and compliance activities in their work plans do not reflect ONRR compliance goals, as stated in the agreements between the nine members and ONRR. By requiring STRAC member states to describe in their annual work plans how their compliance activities would align with ONRA's current compliance goals and tracking each state's performance toward these goals would provide ONRR with better assurance that compliance activities are aligned with its performance goals.
U.S. compacts of free association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau allow migrants from these countries to live and work in the United States for a period of time. In 2003, Congress amended the compacts to allow for more than 1,000 compact migrants in each of the FASs and to provide $30 million annually for fiscal years 2004 through 2023 for grants to the affected jurisdictions. GAO was asked to review compact migration. This report (1) presents estimates of compact migrant populations and recent trends in compact migration; (2) summarizes reported costs related to compact migration in three affected jurisdictions—Hawaii, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)—and (3) describes effects of compact migration on governments, workforces, and societies in these areas. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Census Bureau's 2013-2017 American Community Survey and the 2018 enumeration of compact migrants for Guam, the CNMI, and American Samoa; reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and other documents; and interviewed federal, state, and territorial government officials, as well as private sector and nonprofit representatives. From 2009 to 2018, the number of Micronesian, Marshallese, Palauan, and Marshallese compact migrants living in U.S.-designated areas rose by an estimated 68 percent, from about 56,000 to about 94,000, according to combined data from two Census Bureau surveys and the most recent required enumeration in 2018. This estimate indicates growth in compact migrants since 2011, when GAO reported that 58 percent of these migrants lived in the affected areas. Stakeholders GAO interviewed—including officials from the Department of the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) and the four affected jurisdictions and representatives of private sector, nonprofit, and public sector organizations—expressed concerns about the prior Census Bureau estimates of the compact migrant population. For example, some stakeholders said that some migrant populations are apprehensive or distrustful about being formally counted or counted through surveys. The affected jurisdictions reported a total of $3.2 billion in estimated compact impact costs during the period 2004 through 2018, with estimated annual costs increasing from $55 million in fiscal year 2004 to $198 million in 2018 for Hawaii and fluctuating from $10 million to $116 million for the CNII. The three affected areas reported costs for education, health, public safety, and social services, with the highest total costs in 2017 for education and health services. In fiscal years 2014 through 2019, Hawaii, Guam and theCNMI received a combined total of approximately $509 million in compact impact grant funding from Interior to defray these costs. In October 2019, Census Bureau officials discovered an error in the 2013 and 2018 Census Bureau enumerations that caused inaccurate counts in Hawaii and resulted in misallocation of compact impact funding in fiscal years 2015 through 2020. In February 2020, Interior officials told GAO that the department had developed a modified plan for compact impact grants that is intended to correct the misall allocation. The governments of some of the areas GAO visited identified effects of providing public services to compact migrants, such as health care, education, and housing, and also reported budgetary contributions from compact migrants' payment of taxes and fees and other government programs and services. Compact migrants are eligible to work and have contributed to the workforces of receiving communities, holding jobs in a range of industries, including manufacturing, service industries, and professional industries. However, stakeholders reported that compact migrants have encountered challenges participating in the workforce, including difficulties in obtaining full-term REAL ID–compliant identification and commercial driver's licenses. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) modified its policy in September 2019 to allow compact migrants to obtain REAL ID-compliant licenses by presenting an unexpired passport and employment authorization document (Form I-94) to employers to demonstrate their identity and employment authorizations. In addition, some compact migrants reported that they had faced workplace discrimination or were seen as harming the local economy. In Hawaii, the Hawaii Advisory Committee for Civil Rights concluded that some migrants find it difficult to report workplace discrimination because they are concerned about retaliation.
The United States and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) entered into a covenant in 1976 establishing the island territory's status as a self-governing commonwealth in political union with the United States. The covenant also granted the CNMI the right of self-governance over internal affairs and granted the U.S. complete responsibility and authority for matters relating to foreign affairs and defense affecting the islands. In 2008, Congress amended the covenant to generally apply federal immigration law, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), with a transition period for foreign workers and investors. In 2011, Congress passed the CNRA, which amended the CNAA to establish a CNMI-Only Transitional Worker program to provide for an orderly transition of foreign workers to the CN Islands. The CNRA limits the number of permits that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may issue annually and reduces that number each year until the end of the transition period. In addition, the INA provides DHS with discretionary authority to grant parole to certain noncitizens, on a case-by-case basis, allowing them to be temporarily present in theUnited States, including CNMI, with certain limited exceptions. In response to Executive Order 13767, on December 27, 2018, USCIS announced the termination of parole for certain CNMI residents, CNMI permanent residents, immediate relatives, spouses and children of deceased residents and immediate relatives of citizens of the freely associated states, and certain in-home foreign worker caregivers of residents. Under H.R. 560, a foreign national who meets additional eligibility requirements, including having resided continuously and lawfully in theCNMI from November 28, 2009, through the date of enactment, may be granted CNMI resident status if that individual was admitted as a foreign worker in fiscal year 2015 and during every subsequent fiscal year beginning before July 24, 2018. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which DHS has implemented the foreign worker and investor provisions of the Covenant and (2) proposed legislative changes to the Covenant. It is based on GAO's prior and ongoing work on CNMI immigration issues. GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and other documents related to foreign workers, foreign investors, and parole. For this testimony, GAO also interviewed officials from USCIS, the CNMO government, and the CNIM Chamber of Commerce, and reviewed data from DHS on foreign workers admitted as CW-1 permit holders and H-2B beneficiaries for the construction trade from fiscal years 2016 through 2018. GA O is not making any new recommendations in this testimony. DHS has taken a number of actions in response to the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-53, as amended, to restrict the use of certain construction trade permits for workers in the CNVI. For example, in October 2016, DHS announced the list of countries whose citizens were eligible to participate in the H.2B program from January 18, 2017, to January 2018. Asian countries on the list included the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, among others, but did not include China. In January 2019, because of concerns about overstays and human trafficking, DHS removed the Philippines from the list. CNMI government and chamber of Commerce officials have voiced concerns that the removal of the Philippines will make it difficult to hire construction workers after two recent typhoons. USCIS began approving 2-year E-2C status for eligible foreign long-term investors and their dependents in the territory in fiscal years 2011. As of February 5, 2019, 56 investors who had previously resided in CNMI as investors under CNMI law were residing in the territories with E- 2C status. As a result, these 56 investors could be eligible to apply for CNMIresident status if they met all other eligibility conditions, such as having been admitted as foreign workers under the territory's immigration system since 2015.
Since 2017, NRC has made a number of changes to its fee-setting, billing, and budgeting processes in response to GAO and internal NRC findings and recommendations. GAO was asked to review NRC's process for setting fees. This report examines (1) changes NRC made to its billing process since 2017 to improve the transparency, accuracy, and timeliness of the process, and (2) changes to NRC’s budgeting process that address some but not all of its internal initiatives, prior GAO findings and NRC OIG recommendations, and prior NRC Office of Inspector General (OIG) recommendations. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed NRC documents and interviewed NRC officials and 11 licensees selected based on their use of nuclear material, among other factors. Since 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has taken action to improve its billing processes, but some information is still not transparent. In response to a GAO recommendation in 2017, in 2018 GAO reported that NRC was undertaking an initiative to transition to an electronic billing system known as eBilling, but it had not developed planning documents for the initiative. In addition, in 2017 GAO recommended that the agency develop a project plan for this initiative that would establish plans for schedule and cost, involve licensees in developing system capabilities, and include steps to assess the results of implementing the system. NRC implemented these recommendations as part of its planning process. For example, it solicited feedback from nine licensees it selected for an eBills pilot and included metrics assessing the system in its project plan. As a result, in September 2019 NRC sent all licensees receiving service fee invoices an informational brochure giving instructions for how to enroll in the program, and in October 2019 it began distributing electronic invoiced through eBilled. In 2018, in addition to these initiatives, N RCG also updated its billing codes—the codes NRC staff use to record their work hours on time cards—in response to recommendations made by GAO, the agency's OIG, and other NRC internal initiatives. In particular, the billing codes now have a consistent naming convention, which increased the risk of staff charging their time to the wrong billing codes, which, in turn, could lead to billing errors. As part of GAO's prior review of NRCs billing process, in 2014, GA OIG recommended that N RC standardize and document its billing validation process, along with developing and issuing guidance for the process. In 2017 NRC also implemented a standardized process to validate charges to licensees to improve accuracy. In August 2019, NRA implemented a revised process for validating time charged to licenseers in order to identify billing errors in a timelier manner, and standardize billing validation throughout the agency. In January 2018 NRC updated the service fee invoice it sends to licenseees to include the names of staff and contractors billing time and updated information on the progress of work performed on ongoing regulatory actions, but has not yet implemented an internal recommendation to provide licensees with information on work progress on ongoing actions. In fiscal year 2018, for the first time NRC began presenting actual obligation data in its annual budget justifications, which is required by law, to better enable users of the budget justification to understand how NRC spent its appropriations. Specifically, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2019, actual obligations for overhead—currently named Corporate Support— decreased 4 percent, from $302.9 million to $291.2 million, but as a percentage of total agency-wide obligations increased by about 2.3 percent. In some years, reductions in Corporate Support were offset by pay increases consistent with federal government-wide guidance and investments in information technology, among others, but in other years, such as fiscal year 2015, Corporate Support increased due to increases in rent, utilities, and information technology investments. In its fiscal year 2020 budget justification, in part to address GAO recommendations, in February 2019, in its Fees Transformation Initiative NRC will begin presenting data on its congressionally-directed carryover funds using the same business lines it used to present the rest of the information in its budget justification.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) are responsible for screening noncitizens who arrive at the southwest border expressing an intention to apply for asylum, a fear of persecution or torture, or a fear that they will be returned to their country. GAO was asked to review processes for screening these cases. This report discusses (1) what USCIS and EOIR data show about the credible and reasonable fear processes, (2) the extent to which USCIS has policies and procedures for overseeing these screenings, and (3) the degree of processes for managing their respective workloads. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed USCIS data from fiscal year 2014 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review; reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; and interviewed officials from USCIS, ICE, and DOJ. From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, USCIS's credible andreasonable fear caseloads—that is, the number of cases in which a noncitizens expresses a credible or reasonable fear—increased from about 56,000 to almost 109,000 cases. USCIS officials told GAO that the agency has developed various policies and processes for overseeing the screening process, but gaps exist in training, quality assurance, and family processing. For example, while USCIS provides basic training to new asylum officers, not all offices provide additional pre-departure training to officers before they begin screening cases for family units at ICE's family residential centers, where asylum officers screen cases for credible fear cases. In addition, asylum officers are not required to record in their automated case management system if individuals receive credible fear determinations as principal applicants, dependents, or in the interest of family unity. Without systematically recording all outcomes of credible fear screenings for family members in a more complete manner, the agency may not have complete data on credible fear determination rates, and it may not be in a position to report on the scope of its policy for family member in the credible fear process. Further, although USCIS tracks some of these delays in its case management systems, the system does not distinguish between specific reasons for logistical case delays, such as telephones not working properly or lack of space at detention facilities for officers to screen cases. Furthermore, while the system can calculate the processing days for each credible fear case, it cannot track how long case delays last. By collecting and analyzing additional information on case delays and how long they last and analyzing relevant case delays for officers conducting fear screenings could help USCIS mitigate reasons for case processing delays and improve efficiency in case processing.
Technological advances have led to increases in automation and corresponding changes in the workforce, including the adoption of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics. GAO was asked to review the workforce effects of these technologies. This report examines (1) what is known about how advanced technologies affect the U.S. workforce; (2) selected federal agency efforts to track and monitor the adoption and workforce effects; (3) considerations that led selected firms to adopt advanced technologies and the risks they faced; and (4) ways technology adoption has affected the workforce at selected firms. GA O analyzed federal data from the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Science Foundation, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and other federal agencies; interviewed officials from these agencies; and visited 16 firms that are using advanced technologies to learn more about the adoption process, as well as about workforce effects at these firms. Advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and other technological drivers of workforce changes, are continually progressing and new developments emerge regularly. For example, automated vehicles have varying levels of autonomy. Similarly, while robots have existed for decades, today's generation of robots may be equipped with machine vision and learning capabilities that enable them to perform a more expansive array of tasks. How, when, or whether technologies progress from development to commercialization (i.e., readiness for adoption) is generally dependent on context-specific considerations, which are difficult to predict. However, a number of studies have developed models to identify jobs that are susceptible to automation, and some suggest that automation may have a net positive effect on employment, or at least on employment in certain sectors, which may be consistent with historical employment trends. The Department of Commerce and the Department of Labor (DOL) have some efforts under way to track technology adoption and the potential workforce effects, but none of the survey results will be available until late 2019 and later. The Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey (ABS) collects information on firms' use of advanced technology, but the first ABS results are not expected to be available for several years. Census plans to add questions to the ABS that could be used to examine the extent of technology adoption nationwide and the impact these technologies might have on the number and skill level of workers, but these new questions are not intended to provide information to quantify the magnitude of workforce effects. In addition, until the ABS data are available and evaluated, it remains unclear what limitations, if any, the data may have. The White House is coordinating policy and research activities related to advanced technologies. Most of the 16 firms GAO visited adopted advanced technologies through a phased process of innovation and technology adoption, and most cited cost savings and job quality as a primary consideration for adopting advanced technologies as the primary reasons for doing so. Officials at some of these firms told GAO that advanced technologies enabled them to increase efficiency, reduce labor costs, increase productivity, and increase the number of workers in certain positions. For instance, a large appliance manufacturer adopted a collaborative robot to help it produce more of its own component parts, which enabled it to increase production by about 15 percent over the last 12 years, according to officials. Other firms adopted these technologies because they wanted to automate tasks that are dangerous, difficult, dull, or dirty in large part to improve worker safety, and to optimize the value added by workers. Officials from some of the selected firms said they adopted these advanced technologies in part because they were concerned about the reliability of the technology and the risk of working with new technology developers who had established reputations and track records, among other reasons. Adopting advanced technologies has had varied effects on the workforce of selected firms, including declines in some types of work and gains in others. Officials said advanced technologies have replaced positions at some firms, but most relied on the redeployment of workers and attrition rather than layoffs to adjust their workforces. Some firms hired additional workers to perform tasks previously done by workers, while others hired new workers to maintain existing positions or to take on new tasks. Some officials also said that, although they may not have grown workforces due to adopting these technologies, adopting them has helped firms grow their workforce size and productivity.
Female active-duty servicemembers in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Air National Guard make up over half of the U.S. military force. GAO was asked to review issues related to female participation in the military. This report examines (1) trends in the percentage of female servicemember attrition and the factors leading to that attrition from fiscal years 2004 through 2018, (2) how female promotion rates compare with those of their male counterparts, and (3) the extent to which DOD and the military services have plans to guide and monitor female recruitment and retention. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 on active- duty female and male personnel, and reviewed a literature review of studies on retention and recruitment of female military personnel, including a review of 87 studies published between 2008 and 2018. For the literature review and content analysis GAO reviewed, it also interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI), and the four military services. From fiscal year 2004 to 2018—the most recent 15-year period for which DMDC had complete data available—the percentage of women serving on active duty increased slightly department-wide from 15.1 percent to 16.5 percent, with slight decreases identified in some years—for example, fiscal years 2005 through 2009. However, female enlisted and commissioned officers had higher attrition rates than male counterparts during that same period, and the percentage began to decrease at the 10-to-less-than-20-years of service career point, meaning a smaller pool of women were available for leadership opportunities. For example, in fiscal year 2018, the Marine Corps had the lowest percentages of female enlisted (8.7 percent) and commissioned officer (7.9 percent). GAO's review of existing literature also found that female servicEMembers are generally more likely to separate from the military, and that the reasons for separation vary by gender, pay grade category, and length of service. In addition, other factors—such as access to quality childcare or family planning—have been found to influence female active- Duty Servicemember separation decisions based on existing literature. Promotion rates varied by gender for enlisted and officers, and GAO found that the likelihood of promotion varies across demographic groups, including gender and pay grade. In fiscal years 2015 and 2018, for example, promotion rates for female enlisted were slightly higher than for male enlisted, but slightly lower for female commissioned officers. The percentage of promotions decreases at certain grade levels and varies across certain characteristics, such as gender. The military services do not have plans that include goals, performance measures, or timeframes to guide or monitor their efforts to recruit and retain female active duty personnel. While the Department of Defense's (DOD) diversity and inclusion strategic plan is currently being developed to guide efforts through 2024, it does not provide guidance to the services for developing plans to monitor and guide their efforts. Without such guidance and clear plans, the services are not positioned to achieve the department's goals of maintaining a ready force that includes the best and the brightest and is also representative of the population it serves.
The PSLF and TEPSLF programs provide loan forgiveness to eligible borrowers who make 120 on-time monthly payments for the full amount due on their Direct Loans after they have met all program requirements. In May 2018, Congress appropriated $700 million for the first two years of the first loan forgiveness program, which became available in May 2018. GAO was asked to review the process for borrowers to apply for loan forgiveness under these programs. This report examines (1) the extent to which Education has approved or denied borrowers' loan forgiveness requests, (2) Education's outreach to borrowers about the loan forgiveness opportunity, and (3) Educations online information on the opportunity. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and procedures and interviewed officials from Education, the loan servicer, and selected organizations representing student borrowers. The Department of Education (Education) has approved 1 percent (661) and denied 99 percent (53,523) of borrowers requests for forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLLF) program and has spent 4 percent (approximately $26.9 million) of the $700-million appropriated for the Temporary Expanded Private Sector Loan forgiveness (TEPSLS) program, according to the most recent data from the TEPSSF loanservicer. Of the 53,523 denied requests, about 38,000 were ineligible for consideration because the borrower had not submitted an application for the program, and the remaining 15,000 requests were denied because they did not meet other program requirements, such as not being in default on their loans for at least 10 years. While a PLSF application is not explicitly required by statute for a borrower to be considered for TEPSF loan forgiveness, Education officials said that the department added this step to the process in order to roll out the program within the required 60 days. The large number of requests denied for not submitting an application suggests that borrowers may be confused about this requirement. In addition, Education does not provide borrowers with information about options for contesting decisions to deny their requests. Federal internal control standards for external communication with stakeholders call for communication of quality information with external parties to achieve program objectives. Providing this information in relevant denial letters and Education websites will increase the likelihood that borrowers with valid concerns will have their requests appropriately resolved. Education conducts direct outreach to certain individual borrowers, but its general outreach activities are limited. For example, Education has not required all loan servicers websites to include information about TEPSPLSF and has not included information about the program in its PSLLL Online Help Tool, which assists borrowers with determining whether their loans and employment qualify and which forms they need to submit to obtain loan forgiveness. According to Education data, since the rollout of the online tool in December 2018 through the beginning of March 2019, about 340,000 users have used the tool, and about 100,000 have logged on and have collectively generated about 40,000 PSLP-related forms, including forms for applying for the TEESLF program. Including information on this topic in the online help tool and noting it on all loan servicing websites could increase borrower awareness of TEPSlF and the likelihood of borrowers being able to take advantage of this opportunity.
As U.S. and foreign air carriers have pursued more integrated forms of cooperation through international air alliances, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has extended antitrust immunity to three of these carriers to allow them to cooperate more closely on key economic elements of their businesses that U. S. antitrust laws might prohibit. GAO was asked to review DOT's process for granting immunity. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOT analyzes competitive and public benefit effects when granting immunity and (2) how DOT oversees and monitors the implementation and effects of immunities. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DOT documents and interviewed DOT officials, industry stakeholders, and academic and other experts. DOT's review of requests for immunity and oversight of immunized agreements are important to ensuring robust competition and, thus, consumer benefits in the marketplace. DOT reviews applications to grant immunity based on a variety of factors, such as the expected effects on competition and consumer benefits. For example, DOT's competitive analysis focuses on the likely effect of the proposed cooperative agreement on competition in key airline markets, while its public benefits analysis looks at the likelihood of carrier integration yielding consumer benefits, among other things. DOT has granted immunity to carriers 31 times since 1993, with some grants of immunity conditioned on carriers' ability to implement the agreement quickly, according to GAO's analysis of DOT's antitrust immunity proceedings. Stakeholders GAO interviewed considered DOT's final decisions and application review process to be largely transparent, but lengthy. DOT officials and some stakeholders we interviewed underscored that there are opportunities for interested parties, including competing airlines, to examine all submitted application materials--including confidential and proprietary information--and to provide substantive comments. DOT is required to make a final decision within 6 months from the date of an application but may issue a notice to suspend the procedural schedule in order to establish a complete record of information on the official docket as the basis for its decisions. DOT conducts a number of activities to oversee and monitor individual immunized cooperative agreements and to understand how broad trends in international air competition affect these agreements. DOT monitors these agreements in various ways but does not report on the results of its monitoring activities or on the effects of granted immunities on consumers. According to DOT, the department tracks economic literature on these effects and has recently commissioned its own study. However, DOT has rarely amended or modified, and has seldom revoked, immunity of an approved cooperative agreement. As a result, there is generally little, if any, information from DOT available to external stakeholders and the public regarding DOT's monitoring efforts and its findings on whether immunities have produced anticipated benefits. DOT could periodically provide information on its monitoring efforts, based on its ongoing monitoring activities, on the public docket, or through other mechanisms. This information could provide greater transparency and be useful in considering changes in DOT's authority to grant antitrust immunity, an authority Congress and others have considered at various points.
From October 23, 2015, through February 11, 2016, the Aliso Canyon Underground Storage Facility in Los Angeles County, California, experienced a large and uncontrolled natural gas leak that affected about 8,000 families and led to the evacuation of about 30,000 people from their homes. In November 2017, GAO reported that the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) had established a strategic goal for its natural gas storage program to promote continuous safety performance but had not yet set performance goals that define the level of performance that officials hope to achieve or that address all core program activities, such as conducting effective inspections. GAO was asked to review the safety of natural gas stored in underground storage sites. This report (1) assesses the extent to which PHMSA has further developed its program since GAO's November 2017 report, (2) describes what is known about the potential health effects from chemicals in stored natural gas, and (3) describes the potential environmental effects of releases at natural gas Storage sites. To address these objectives, we reviewed documents and interviewed officials from DOT, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other federal agencies, as well as state and local officials in seven states selected to represent different types of storage sites, among other things. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provided insights. The Department of Energy's (DOE), Pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration (PHmSA) has not fully evaluated its workforce needs for the program or established performance goals since November 2017 or fully assessed resource needs for its changing workload or established a performance goal that measures its progress toward its relevant strategic goal to improve safety. Since 2017, the agency has established a goal to inspect all of the approximately 400 storage sites over 5 years (from early 2018 through early 2023) and has started inspecting sites to meet that goal. However, it has not yet fully assessed workforce needs to guide its budget requests, as GAO recommended in November 2017. For example, in 2017, PHmSA estimated that it would need about 203 work weeks of inspectors' time to inspect about 200 of the 400 sites, but in October 2018, officials told GAO that their inspectors would need more time than previously estimated to complete each site inspection, due to requirements for operators in the 2016 minimum safety standards. As of June 2019, only 10 of the 25 state governments eligible to partner with the agency on inspections have agreed to do so, according to agency officials. As a result, unless additional states partner, the number of sites the agency will need to inspect will increase from about 200 to 322 in order for the agency to meet its inspection goal of inspecting all of these sites by 2023. In addition, because the agency does not have assurance that it has enough resources to meet this inspection goal, it may not have the data it needs to analyze the factors affecting states' willingness to participate in inspections and analyze the agency's workforce needs on an ongoing basis. By analyzing these factors and using this information to guide budget requests for future inspections, PHM SA would have more reasonable assurance it has the necessary staff to meet the inspection goal. Several federal agencies—including EPA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the National Institute for Occupational safety and Health (NIOSH)—have documented potential health Effects from chemicals that may be found in stored Natural Gas. These chemicals include hydrogen sulfide, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, among others. EPA, for example, has found that inhaling benzene can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and unconsciousness and that long-term benzene exposure affects the bone marrow and can cause anemia and leukemia. Also, ATSDR found that toLUene may affect the nervous system and at low to moderate levels can cause tiredness, confusion, weakness, memory loss, nausea, and loss of appetite. In some instances, groundwater has been contaminated by the release of natural Gas from storage sites in California and Colorado, but the extent of the risk to groundwater is not known because data are limited. In two examples of releases from 2000 through 2018 that potentially affected groundwater, a 2003 release at the Playa Del Rey storage site in California, and a 2006 release at a storage site near Fort Morgan in Colorado, both of which involved releases of gas and other fluids mixed with the gas. The potential environmental and health effects of
DOT has taken several steps to study the issue of accessible lavatories on single-aisle aircraft, but as of December 2019, none of these actions has resulted in a regulation. GAO was asked to review the issue. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected U.S. carriers have selected aircraft with lavatories designed to accommodate passengers with mobility impairments, and (2) the impact that the lack of accessible aircraft lavatories has had on persons with reduced mobility, and DOT's efforts to address this issue. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from eight carriers with a range of sizes and types of aircraft, as well as the manufacturers of lavatories for these aircraft, which were selected based on factors such as the number of wheelchair-accessible lavatories available on their aircraft. The results of these interviews cannot be generalized beyond these eight carriers and do not represent a representative sample of all aircraft with available lavatories. The Department of Transportation (DOT) provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Aircraft manufacturers offer lavatory designs that are designed to better accommodate passengers in wheelchairs, but carriers do not often choose to acquire them. Of the eight carriers GAO interviewed, four have some aircraft--all of which are Airbus aircraft--with lavatories that are intended to accommodate people with mobility disabilities to some extent. These four carriers have either the Space Flex version 1 or the Airbus A220 lavatory, both of which have a design that allows for a passenger in a wheelchair to enter the lavatory with or without the help of an assistant. In addition, two of these four carriers--Boeing's 737 aircraft and the Boeing 737 MAX--have one lavatory that is designed for passengers in an onboard wheelchair, while the other two have a lavatory designed for people who do not use a wheelchair. Overall, about 4.5 percent of the combined fleet of the eight selected carriers have lavatories in place designed to provide some measure of greater access to passengers with limited mobility, including those who require the use of the onboard wheelchair. According to DOT's monthly aviation travel data, for the first 6 months of 2019, aviation passengers checked a total of 294,216 wheelchairs and scooter in the air. The number of people with reducedmobility flying is likely to increase as older Americans become a greater share of the population. The lack of onboard wheelchair-accommodating lavatories can make flying more challenging for persons with Reduced Mobility, according to representatives from stakeholder groups. They described how some passengers with reduced Mobility take precautionary measures to avoid the need to use an aircraft lavatory such as severely limiting food and fluid intake in advance of the flight, risking dehydration; using a catheter; or wearing a protective undergarment. However, these measures may not alleviate the fear and anxiety that passengers who rely on the wheelchair to get to the lavatories may face during air travel as there is always the possibility of having to deal with circumstances beyond their control. For example, unforeseen events such as increased flight time or delays in getting to the gate can increase the time a passenger has to postpone attending to normal bodily functions. While stakeholders described challenges, neither air carriers nor DOT receive a large number of complaints regarding the lack or availability of lavatory facilities for passengers with disabilities. As GAO has previously reported, DOT receives and processes complaints from passengers and uses complaint data to help identify which carriers to inspect for consumer protection violations. From 2014 through 2018, DOT received 1,263 complaints related to accessibility, inadequate facilities, and flight delays and identified 69 complaints about lavatory in general and 5 about the accessibility of Lavatories. Of these 69 lavatory complaints, 64 related to non-functioning lavatories (e.g., non-operational or unclean lavatories, sinks lacking running water, etc.). However, complaint data are inherently limited because a substantial portion of dissatisfied individuals never complain and are therefore not represented in the complaint data. Finally, when they do complain, their complaints may not be representative of other individuals.
Since 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises (enterprises), have been in conservatorship under authority provided in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA). Since 2008, Congress has considered proposals to reform the housing finance system. GAO was asked to review housing finance reform. This report examines (1) recent developments in the housing and financial markets that could affect the safety and soundness of the enterprises, (2) risks and challenges that the ongoing conservatorships pose to the status and operations of the enterprise and other aspects of the system, and (3) reform options that have been proposed and their relative strengths and limitations. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed and analyzed key housing market indicators since the 2007–2009 financial crisis, examined 14 reform proposals, and convened four panels of housing finance experts and stakeholders. The housing market has recovered since the financial crisis with significant federal support, but recent trends—some loosening of underwriting standards, the rise of nonbank mortgage lenders and servicers, and less access to affordable housing and homeownership—may pose additional risks to the housing market and participants, including the enterprises. Indicators of recovery include rising house prices and declining mortgage delinquency rates. However, the federal government has continued to support the market with guarantees on more than two-thirds of new mortgages each year since 2008, either through government-insured originations or by guaranteeing timely payment to investors on mortgage loans purchased and securitized by the enterprises and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. The government also has played a very substantial role in the secondary market, guaranteeing around 95 percent or more of all mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued annually since 2008. Recent trends—including changes in borrower credit risk and the growth in the number of nonbanks—may present additional challenges to the market and enterprises. For example, average credit scores for enterprise-purchased loans rose significantly from their pre-crisis lows and remained historically high through 2012 but have since declined slightly. Additionally, FHFA and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) officials told GAO that nonbanks have helped provide liquidity and access to mortgage credit, but several stakeholders and experts identified the increased presence of non banks as a current risk to the system. For instance, during times of financial stress, lenders to nonbank lenders have the right to quickly pull their lines of credit and seize and sell the underlying collateral if nonbanks do not maintain certain levels of net worth in the event of a liquidity crisis. Additionally (see figure), while nonbanks are subject to some federal oversight, they are not federally regulated for safety or soundness. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) have taken actions to reduce the enterprises' exposure to risk, but risks, uncertainty, and challenges remain. FH FA-directed actions (including retained mortgage portfolio reductions, credit risk transfer, and foreclosure prevention) have improved the condition of the Enterprises by mitigating some of their exposures to potential losses. Treasury's remaining funding commitment through the senior preferred stock purchase agreements leaves taxpayers exposed to risk. As of the end of August 2018, Treasury had provided the enterprises with $191.4 billion of the total amount of financial support since they were placed under conservatorscy in 2008, leaving $254.1 billion in potential taxpayer exposure should Treasury need to provide additional support. Since the second quarter of 2012, the enterprises have not required additional support from Treasury, with the exception of the first quarter of 2018, when both enterprises required Treasury support due to devaluation of their deferred tax assets as a result of changes to the tax code. In addition to economic circumstances, changes in market conditions or other external factors—such as changes in interest rates, house prices, accounting standards, or events such as natural disasters—could lead to volatility in the enterprises quarterly financial results, potentially requiring additional taxpayer support. The extended duration of the conservatorships continues to create uncertainty about the goals and future role of theprises and presents challenges. The current structure of the secondary mortgage market will continue to leave taxpayers at risk of potential losses if the enterprises remain under conservator and without a defined future role. Proposals to reform housing finance aim to manage fiscal exposure, but some do not have clear goals or a system-wide approach, and others do not consider other federal entities in the system such as the Federal Housing Administration (F
Social Security is the foundation of the U.S. retirement system and provides millions of older Americans with retirement income and benefits. GAO was asked to examine how income and wealth have changed over time for older Americans. This report examines (1) the distributions of income andwealth among all older Americans over time; (2) the association between income, wealth, and longevity among older Americans; and (3) how these distributions have changed for a cohort of individuals as they aged. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative survey of Americans born from 1931 through 1941, and the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a triennial survey of household assets and income from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). GAO also reviewed literature on retirement security and interviewed researchers and experts. The Department of Labor and the Social Security Administration provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Disparities in income and Wealth Among Older Americans: GAO's analysis of HRS data from 1992 to 2014 found that, in general, income disparities decreased as households aged, but disparities in wealth persisted. Households with the top 20 percent of mid-career earnings saw larger drops in income than households in other groups, such as those in the bottom 20 percent, but wealth remained steady for most households. For example, in 1992, households in thebottom 20 percent had estimated median wealth of about $93,000 compared to $432,000 in 2014, and in 2014 the bottom had $66,000 and the top had about $539,000. In contrast, in 2016, the median wealth for the top 1 percent of households was estimated to be about $6.1 million compared to about $22,000 for the bottom 1 percent, and estimated wealth in the top 10 percent was about $3.3 million compared with about $2.9 million in 2014. Income and wealth were consistently lower for older households headed by someone who was a racial minority, single, or hadn't attended college, according to GAO analysis of 1989 through 2016 SCF data. For the top 5 percent of the income distribution, the percentage of households with retirement accounts increased from 4 percent in 1989 to 11 percent in 2016. In addition, in 1989, households with no retirement accounts had an estimated average income of $9,000, while in 2016 it was estimated that households with a retirement account balance of at least $10,000 had an average wealth of $11,000 (see figure). Longevity: In 1992, when the HRS began, the original HRS cohort of Americans aged 51-61 was the oldest in the nation. By 2014, this cohort had reached their 70s or early 80s. Overall, an estimated 63 percent of these individuals were alive at the end of the study, and greater levels of wealth and income were associated with greater longevity. Income, Wealth, and Demographic Characteristics: In addition to income, several demographic characteristics were also associated with longevity, including race and ethnicity, education, and self-reported health status. However, the relationships of these characteristics with longevity are complex because of interactions among these characteristics themselves, which make it difficult to determine the direction or extent of causality. For instance, higher levels of education could provide access to better job opportunities, increasing income. Education could contribute to greater financial literacy and better financial decision making, increasing wealth. Having access to wealth could make it easier to attain additional education. Even among individuals with characteristics associated with decreased longevity, a substantial proportion of older individuals lived at least into their early 70s and 80s according to our analysis.
The Department of Defense (DOD) is the largest sponsor of FFRDCs, with about $3.2 billion in obligations to 10 DOD-sponsored centers in fiscal year 2018. These centers perform a variety of tasks, such as technical studies and analyses, research and development, and systems engineering, on behalf of DOD. DOD uses S&A Center research to inform decision-making, shape guidance, policies, and training, and identify opportunities to save time and money. GAO was asked to review DOD's use of S and A Centers. This report examines (1) DOD's obligations to DOD-Sponsored Federal Research and Analysis Centers (FFRDC) from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, and (2) the extent to which DOD has taken steps to assess the value of research and centers. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed DOD documents; and interviewed DOD officials and representatives from the five S andA Centers selected to provide a range of perspectives on the value and outcomes of their work. DOD obligations to the 10 FFR DCs it has sponsored generally increased annually from about $2.7 billion in 2013 to 2018, with obligations to these centers totaling approximately $3 billion in 2018. Approximately 70 percent of these obligations went to support non-intelligence programs and were comprised of DOD obligations associated with utilized Defense Science and Technology, or Defense STE, obligations. DOD reported it primarily considered strategic relationships and core competencies when sponsoring and initiating research projects at the five centers. For example, DOD's Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S)) officials told GAO that DOD often chooses S&a Centers to perform work for it due to unique long-term strategic relationships with sponsors for independent and knowledgeable expertise within core competency to address sponsors' specific analytic requirements. DOD reports that it uses studies and analysis to inform decisions; shape guidance; shape policies, training; and identify potential efficiencies; and takes some steps to determine the value to DOD of research. DOD's primary sponsors—the military department or organization within DOD responsible for the overall use of the center—assess the value, technical quality, responsiveness, and timeliness of the work performed by the centers through annual performance reviews and comprehensive reviews. These reviews include a review and summary of the centers' accomplishments and effectiveness in meeting the primary sponsor's needs. DOD does not track to what extent a research project's recommendations were implemented, and how. While primary sponsors are not tracking recommendations, in 2015 one of the Centers began tracking recommendations made to the Air Force. According to a RAND PAF representative, the tracking system captures the issue, approach, conclusions, opportunities, and outcomes for each completed project. While tracking recommendations is useful according to some primary sponsors, some DOD officials cautioned that tracking recommendations would not provide insights into the overall value across all S and a Center's research. In February 2019, DOD issued a memorandum related to the oversight of the Personnel and Readiness Studies and Analysis program that tasked the program director with developing a framework that improves accountability for project results and the implementation of study recommendations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DOD instruction state that an F FRDC must be free from conflicts of interest and fully disclose financial and outside interests to the sponsoring agency. Additionally, the DOD instruction outlines steps that primary sponsors should take to prevent and mitigate these conflicts. Each of the five Centers GAO examined has corporate-wide conflict of interest policies and practices that incorporate key elements outlined in the DOD instructions. These elements include, but are not limited to, having procedures in place to screen employees for potential conflicts; requiring disclosure of financial and other interests that might affect the employee's objectivity; and reporting any conflicts to the applicable contracting officer or contracting officer's representative as soon as they are identified.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides health care services to approximately 9 million veterans and their families and relies on its health information system--VistA--to do so. VistA has been essential to the department's ability to deliver health care to veterans. In June 2017, the former VA Secretary announced that the department planned to acquire the same electronic health record (EHR) system that the Department of Defense (DOD) is acquiring—Cerner Millennium. GAO was asked to review VA's transition to the Cerner system. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which VA has identified costs for the system and (2) the status of VA's efforts to define the system. It is based on GAO's ongoing review of VA information technology (IT) programs and systems. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed VA documents and interviewed VA officials. VA identified total costs of about $2.3 billion for the development and sustainment of the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHS) system, referred to as the Veterans Integrated Health Record (VISTA) from fiscal years 2015 through 2017, but could not sufficiently demonstrate the reliability of all of these costs. VA's Office of Information and Technology (OIT) identified costs of approximately $913.7 million, $664.3 million, and $711.1 million in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. However, VA could not demonstrate that these costs were reliable because, for example, source data were not well documented, changes in the cost information provided to GAO during the review indicated that the cost data may not be credible, and subject matter experts were unclear about how to separate Vist a and non-Vist a costs. In addition, VA omitted certain costs from the total costs identified for fiscal years2015, 2016, and 2017. For example, OIT officials stated that additional costs related to work on clinical terminology mapping and functional testing and data standardization and testing were not included in the total cost for VISTA for fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2017. VA officials said they were working on identifying a reliable approach for calculating these costs in the future. VA is not likely to be positioned to retire Vist A for at least another 10 years, but the department does not have the comprehensive and reliable cost information needed to make critical management decisions for sustaining the system over the next 10 years until the new EHR system is fully deployed. VA plans to deploy the new system at three initial operating capability sites in the Pacific Northwest within 18 months of October 1, 2018, with a phased implementation of the remaining sites over a decade. VA has taken steps to define parts of the system, including components and interfaces, but has not developed a comprehensive system definition. VA maintains multiple documents and a database that describe parts of Vistsa, but officials acknowledged that there is no comprehensive definition. While defining a complex IT system can be challenging, having an adequate understanding of its characteristics will better position the organization to comprehensively project and account for costs over the life of a system or program as well as identify specific technical and program risks. As a result, VA has completed a number of efforts to better define Vista and understand the environment in which it operates and additional work is planned.
DOD uses historic properties to support mission needs as well as to house military service members and their families. The National Historic Preservation Act requires federal agencies, including DOD, to take into account the effects of their undertakings (hereinafter referred to as projects) on historic properties, and to afford the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such projects. DOD has identified and evaluated 60,000 of its approximately 375,000 properties on installations in the U.S. and its territories as historic, but has not yet evaluated the remaining roughly 258,000 for historic significance. Senate Report 115-130 included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's historic properties. This report assesses the extent to which (1) DOD identifies and evaluates properties for significance, including those that have been privatized, and (2) DOD assesses condition of its historic properties and has guidance on the training of installation personnel. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, executive orders, and DOD guidance and interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the military departments, and selected installations in California, Hawaii, Virginia, and Maryland, selected for reasons including the high concentration of historic properties in each state. The results of these visits are not generalizable to all DOD installations. The Department of Defense's (DOD) efforts to identify and evaluate its properties for historical significance have been limited. In October 2017, DOD reported that it has identified about 60,00 properties as historic and about 57,000 as not being historic. However, GAO identified some gaps in the data DOD reported at the installation level and the department level regarding historic properties for fiscal year 2017. For example, one of the 10 installations GAO visited could not generate a list of historic property on the installation with corresponding data fields such as facility condition, plant replacement value, and facility utilization rate. Officials at this installation told GAO they are working on a long-term project to update their data. Additionally, data GAO collected from three installations were inconsistent with data in the installations' respective military department-level databases. For instance, one installation had 150 more historic properties listed in its installation real property data than were listed in the corresponding military department database. The military services have not consistently recorded real property transactions (i.e., the acquisition of, change to, and disposal of real property assets) and the results of physical inventories of assets, including historic property. DOD's instruction on the management of cultural resources directs the establishment of a process to identify, evaluate, and manage cultural resources, which includes the identification and evaluation of all cultural resources. According to DOD, these inventories are important for planning, analysis, and decision making, but GAO found that these required inventories were not routinely being conducted at six of 10 installations it visited for a variety of reasons. Specifically, cultural resource management officials at six installations said that they were unaware of the requirement or thought that updating their historic property inventories was sufficient to satisfy the inventory requirements. Until DOD clarifies the existing 3 year inventory requirement, current and accurate information on the condition of these historic properties will not be available, which would better position officials who manage these properties to make informed management, maintenance, and planning decisions. DOD also has limited visibility of privatized military housing that could be historic. DOD leases land to a private developer for a 50-year term and conveys existing homes located on the leased land to the developer for the duration of the lease. Given the length of these lease agreements, homes may move beyond 50 years of age while being maintained by the private developer. Military department officials said that when a lease or programmatic agreement is signed with a privatedeveloper, the responsibility for identifying and evaluating homes for historic status is generally transferred to that developer, but the military department officials GAO interviewed could not confirm that private developers were meeting those responsibilities. Taking steps to ensure that installation personnel verify that developers are identifying and evaluate privatized properties for historic importance could help to ensure private developers do not make renovations or repairs to properties that could compromise their historic nature.
Renting became more common in the United States after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but it varied by demographic group and location. GAO was asked to review trends in renter household characteristics, rent affordability, and rental housing conditions. This report examines trends in (1) the share of households that rent and their characteristics, (2) the affordability of rental housing, and (3) rental housing condition. To do this work, GAO analyzed Census Bureau American Community Survey and American Housing Survey data from 2001 through 2017, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review, and interviewed federal agency officials, academic experts, and research organizations. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reviewed a draft of this report and told GAO that it had no comments on the draft. From 2001 to 2017, rentership increased from 36 percent to 36 percent of all U.S. households, with the greatest increase among early middle-aged households (35-49 years old), an estimated increase of nearly 8 percentage points, and rentership for late middle- aged (50-64 years old and younger) and younger (20-34 years old) households increased by 5 percentage points. The number of households with moderate or severe rent burdens (more than 50 percent of household income in rent) increased by 6 percentage points over this period, and the number of low-income households that were severely rent burdened increased by 4 percentage points (see fig.). Rent burden is part of a long-term trend in rental unaffordability, as supply has not kept pace with demand for rental units. With fewer affordable apartments available, rent burdens increased among lower-income renters, who were forced to spend a greater proportion of income on rent. In 2017, an estimated 15 percent of renter households—more than 5 million—lived in units with serious deficiencies, such as cracked walls and the presence of rodents, incomplete units, or units lacking essential components of a dwelling (such as heating equipment or hot and cold running water). The proportion of rental units that had at least one of these deficiencies ranged from an estimated 39 to 47 percent from 2001-2017. Rental housing conditions by unit age or type were generally consistent from 2001–2017. Older and single-family units were more likely to have deficiencies than multifamily units. Households with low incomes (those with low, very low, or extremely low incomes) or with rent burdens comprised half or more of renters living in substantial quality issues and incomplete housing units in 2017. Low-income and rent-burdened households may have fewer affordable options for housing and may end up in housing with deficiencies out of necessity.
Climate change may result in more frequent or intense extreme events, such as flooding, storm surge, and wildfires, which could damage remedies at nonfederal NPL sites and lead to releases of contaminants that could pose risks to human health and the environment. GAO was asked to review the potential impacts of climate change on these sites. This report examines (1) what available federal data suggest about the number of sites that are located in areas that may be impacted by selected climate change effects; (2) the extent to which EPA has managed risks from these potential impacts; and (3) the challenges, if any, EPA faces in managing these risks. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed EPA documents and interviewed EPA officials and other stakeholders, including state and local officials, representatives of potentially responsible parties, and community organizations. The results of GAO's analysis are not generalizable to all stakeholders. Available federal data on flooding,storm surge, wildfires, and sea level rise suggest that about 60 percent (945 of 1,571) of all nonf federal National Priorities List (NPL) sites are in areas where one or more of these potential effects may occur. These data, however, may not fully account for all sites in such areas because they are generally based on current or past conditions; data are not available for some areas; and the National Climate Assessment (NCA) has reported that climate change may exacerbate flooding and wildfires in certain regions of the United States. In addition, EPA does not have quality information on the boundaries of sites, which may affect the agency's ability to identify sites that could be impacted. EPA has taken some initial actions to improve the quality of information on site boundaries, including issuing a directive in 2017 recommending national standards for collecting and maintaining geographic information, including site boundaries. EPA officials told GAO that in 2019 and 2020, the agency plans to move toward recording site boundaries in a consistent format across regions and instituting procedures to validate and update them at least annually. However, there is no schedule in place for completing this effort and EPA officials said that they are uncertain when they will complete it because of competing priorities. By developing a schedule for completing the standardization and improvement of the quality, EPA could more reasonably ensure that it would have quality data with which to fully identify sites in areas impacted by climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes various challenges in managing risks from the potential effects of climate changes on nonf Federal Superfund sites. For example, according to agency documents and officials, EPA has not consistently incorporated climate change information into site-level risk assessments because it does not always have the climate data it needs to do so. EPA's actions to manage risks from potential climate change impacts at nonFederally designated sites align with three of the six essential elements of enterprise risk management, which is a tool that allows agencies to assess threats and opportunities that could affect the achievement of their goals and objectives. Specifically, for the other three essential elements, EPA aligns its risk management process with goals and objective, but has not taken action to clearly align its process for managing risks with agency-wide goals. Without clearly aligning its process, EPA will not have reasonable assurance that senior officials will take an active role in supporting these actions, which would help the agency achieve its mission of protecting human health, the environment, and the economy.
The Department of Defense (DOD) is the world's largest purchaser of weapon systems, spending more than $400 billion on systems in fiscal year 2018 alone. Reliability is critical to ensure that weapon systems perform as intended and that warfighters have the necessary time to execute their missions. GAO was asked to review DOD's approach to reliability. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected major defense acquisition programs have implemented key practices GAO identified in the commercial sector, (2) how selected major acquisition programs addressed reliability during development, and (3) what is known about DOD's policies and guidance on key reliability practices. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD and commercial industry documents and interviewed officials from DOD, the military services, and selected commercial companies. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provided insights on key practices in selected programs. The selected programs GAO examined did not consistently adhere to key practices that GAO has previously identified as key to improving weapon system reliability. For example, the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) and F-22 programs did not involve reliability engineers early during system development. Instead, these programs leveraged engineers after reliability problems arose, including after they integrated components and subsystems and during system-level testing. At the end of system development, the programs brought in additional engineers and established more concerted reliability growth efforts. However, the EFV program was never able to fully realize the benefits of its new approach, as less than 3 years after restarting development it was canceled due to continuing technology problems, development delays, and affordability concerns. Four of the seven selected programs in GAO's review initially pursued unrealistic operational requirements for reliability. These requirements were, therefore, unachievable during development and before fielding the systems to warfighters. When programs overpromise a weapon's prospective performance and deliver systems that cannot achieve their requirements, such as reliability goals, the warfighter receives less capability than originally promised. DOD has had long-established policy and guidance at both the department and service level that recognize the four key practices we found in the private sector. For instance, the 2005 DOD Guide for Achieving Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability addresses the importance of emphasizing reliability with contractors, and the service-level policies at all three military departments establish the importance for reliability engineering activities. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision mandating DOD program managers to include certain reliability requirements in weapon system engineering and manufacturing development and production contracts. In January 2019, the Director of Service Acquisition for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force (USD(A&S)) implemented the provision in the NDAA by issuing a policy memorandum to service Acquisition Executives and other DOD Directors echoing this key practice. DOD's senior leaders, however, have not similarly emphasized the three other key practices, nor have the Secretaries of the Air Force, Army, and Navy, who now have ultimate responsibility for most of DOD's major acquisitions programs. Specifically, these senior leaders have not emphasized the value of leveraging reliability engineers, establishing realistic reliability requirements, and employing reliability engineering to improve a system's design throughout development. As a result, it is less likely that acquisition programs will take the actions necessary to recognize and address potential reliability problems early in the development process. Without senior leadership emphasis on a broader range of key reliability practice, DOD runs the risk of delivering less reliable systems than promised to the warfighters and spending more on rework and maintenance of major weapon systems.
In fiscal year 2018, the Army obligated about $1.6 billion on its marketing and advertising program, which includes activities such as television and print advertisements, event marketing, social media, and mobile assets used at recruiting events. In April 2018, AAA reported that AMRG did not sufficiently evaluate the performance of its primary contractor, effectively oversee deliverables included in its three main contracts, or effectively oversee the negotiation process of task orders. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to review the Army's efforts to improve its marketing program. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Army has taken steps to implement AAA's recommendations and (2) how the Army is addressing the recommendations. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed documentation; and interviewed Army officials. The Army provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The Department of Defense (DOD) and Army Marketing and Research Group (AMRG) officials stated that they have taken some actions to implement recommendations made by the U.S. Army Audit Agency (AAA) in April 2018 to improve their oversight of the Army marketing and Advertising Program (marketing and advertising) but have not yet fully implemented all of them. AAA found that AM RG had deficiencies in how it measured the effectiveness of its marketing efforts and made seven recommendations, with which AMRG agreed. As of September 2019, AAA considered three of the recommendations implemented but not closed, with AMRG still taking steps to address the other four recommendations; as a result, it is too soon to assess the extent that these steps have improved contract oversight within the program. For example, AMRG established a new project management office to help address the challenges identified by AAA and to serve as a coordinating body that centralizes contract oversight. However, the implementation of these recommendations has been slowed, in part, because of the recent award of AMRG's primary marketing contract to a new advertising agency, which has not yet been fully established. To improve its approach for measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of its advertising efforts, AM RG has taken several steps, such as revising its strategic goals, updating and documenting its assessment process, improving the reliability and capabilities of data systems, integrating national and local marketing efforts, and obtaining new tools to determine required marketing resources. These steps are consistent with commercial best practices for assessing advertising identified in GAO's prior work. As the Army takes additional steps to establish the newly-formed Office of the Chief Army Enterprise Marketing once it is fully established, it will be important for the Army to continue to align its efforts with these best practices to ensure that advertising dollars are used efficiently to help meet stated recruiting goals.
Federal agencies reported that they operated 432 data centers in 1998, 2,094 in July 2010, and 9,995 in August 2016, according to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) data center inventory data. OMB established the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) as part of the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act of 2014 (FITARA) to consolidate, optimize, and improve the efficiency of federal data centers. GAO was asked to review agencies' progress in implementing DCOI. This report (1) determines agencies' data center closures and achievement of related savings to date and describes plans for future savings, (2) evaluates progress against OMB's data center optimization targets, and (3) identifies effective practices for achieving closures, cost savings, and optimization. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency data center inventories and plans, interviewed OMB officials, and compared agencies' planned and completed closures and cost savings to OMB targets. The 24 agencies that participate in OMBs DCOO have closed or planned to close a total of 6,250 data centers as of August 2018, which represented about half of the total reported number of federal centers. In addition, the agencies planned 1,009 additional closures through fiscal year 2023. Further, agencies reported $2.3 billion in planned cost savings and avoidances from fiscal years 2016 through 2018. However, these agencies did not plan to meet all of the targets established by OMB for fiscal year 2018. For example, the Department of Defense (Defense) reported that it planned to achieve $205.46 million of its $1.8 billion savings goal by the end of fiscal year 2019, but did not expect to meet any of the five OMB-established targets for its five optimization metrics (server utilization and automated monitoring, energy metering, power usage effectiveness, facility utilization, and virtualization). Until these agencies take action to close enough data centers to meet OMB’s targets, they may not realize the efficiencies and savings that were expected from DCOi. Six agencies reported a number of key practices that had contributed to their success in achieving data center consolidation and optimization activities. These practices included obtaining executive leadership support for consolidation and using lessons learned to refine consolidation; increasing the use of cloud and shared services to consolidate or optimize data center operations; emphasizing closing data centers; and employing an organization-wide communications plan to facilitate adoption of consolidation and optimize activities.
Technology assessments (TAs) are significant given their increasing importance to policymakers, and the growing effects of technology on society, economy, and other areas. While technological changes can be positive, they can also be disruptive. Therefore, it is critical for Congress to be able to understand and evaluate these changes, to ensure, for example, national security and global competitiveness. GAO TAs are most commonly requested by congressional committees, which may use them to, among other things, make decisions regarding allocating or reallocating resources to address research gaps, support updated rulemaking for a regulatory agency, or inform a legislative agenda or the development of a national strategy. To ensure that the information and analyses in TAs meet policymakers' needs, GAO outlines the phases and considerations involved in sound TA design, while remaining aware of the iterative and nonlinear process of designing a TA. This report is based on GAO's review of a literature search, an expert forum, select GAO reports, and experiences of GAO teams and technical specialists. To address these objectives, GA O reviewed and analyzed 14 selected GAO TA reports, as well as selected reports from non-TA product lines that used policy analysis approaches to assess policy options. To augment our understanding of TA design and implementation challenges, we also collected input from GAO staff who had provided key contributions to TAs, and external experts. To assist Congress in its oversight of the federal government, we conducted a literature review and interviewed experts on TA design. We also reviewed selected Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports to consider reviewing that were technology assessments or included an analysis of policy options, based on a keyword search of CRS's website. We selected six CRS reports to review based on the following criteria: (1) published within the past 15 years (2004-2019) and (2) if a review of technology (technology assessment) and/or policy options was included. Reports were excluded based on other criteria, such as whether they represented a summary of a technology assessment that was included in our review or if they did not indicate how CRS arrived at the policy options (no methodology to review or analyze). GAO also interviewed CRS officials. We are not making any recommendations in this report. The Government Accountability Office's (GAO) technology assessment (TA) design process consists of three phases and seven considerations. Phase 1: Develop Initial Design. During this phase, TA teams gather more background information on the technology and context of the technology (e.g., social, political, legal, and economic factors) and develop initial design options. Phase 2: Planning and Proposed Design. At this stage, teams identify and select appropriate design, methodologies, and analytical approaches. Phase 3: Implementation of Design. This phase is when the design and project plan are being implemented, potentially while aspects of phase 2 are still underway. For example, teams may gather additional information regarding policy options and present the results of the analysis during this phase. Phase 4: Final Design. Teams may re-visit design decisions as information is gathered or circumstances change.
IDEA provides grants to states to assist them in providing special education and related services to eligible children with disabilities beginning at age 3 and possibly lasting to the student's 22nd birthday, depending on state law or practice. In fiscal year 2019, the total appropriation for IDEA Parts B and C was approximately $13.2 billion ($12.8 billion for Part B and $470 million for Part C). IDEA requires states to have policies and procedures to ensure that school districts identify, locate, and evaluate all children suspected of having a disability who need special education services, regardless of the severity of their disability, but gives states some latitude in establishing eligibility criteria and defining disability categories. GAO was asked to review the implementation of IDEA Part C. This report examines (1) factors that may account for differences in the percentage of children receiving IDEA services, and (2) how Education and selected states monitor and support Child Find requirements. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed federal special education data from school years 2011 through 2016 (the most recent available at the time of GAO's review); reviewed relevant Department of Education (Education) information; reviewed federal laws, regulations, policies, and selected state laws; and interviewed Education and state officials in four states (Colorado, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, and New York) and 15 school districts in those states and representatives from advocacy organizations representing parents and families of individuals with disabilities and subject matter specialists to discuss issues related to Child Find. Education provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Education and the four states GAO visited reported monitoring Child Find implementation through data collection and supporting it through technical assistance and information. Education's monitoring of state efforts to implement Child Find is part of a broad framework--known as Results Driven Accountability (RDA)--the department uses to monitor certain aspects of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) implementation. To monitor state Child Find activities, Education relies, in part, on four indicators that states must report annually in the State Performance Plan/Annual Performance Report. Three of the indicators pertain to Part C Early Intervention programs and one pertains to Part B. Two Part C Child Find indicators compare the numbers of children served to two data points--the national Part C average (as a percentage) as well as the percentage Education would expect a state to serve based on the state's population. Education has encouraged states whose Part C enrollment is significantly lower than the national average or below expected levels based on state population, to examine compliance with related Part C requirements. The third Child Find indicator measures state compliance with the 45-day timeline. The Part B indicator measures the percent of children who were evaluated within 60 days of receiving parental consent for initial evaluation. This indicator is a compliance indicator for which states must establish a target of 100 percent. Education reported monitoring state implementation of Child Find through data reporting and supporting states with technical Assistance and Information. State and local officials GAO interviewed said challenges identified in identifying and evaluating children who may be eligible for special education may lead to differences in who is served appropriately. For example, according to officials in Massachusetts and Colorado, some infants and toddlers who are eligible and would benefit from Early Intervention services do not receive them because of challenges such as navigating referral processes, obtaining parental consent, and dealing with staffing limitations. In addition, officials in New York said that they sometimes face staffing difficulties when children are located in areas with high crime rates. Officials in all four states said that the schools in their respective districts were using the same type of approach as part of the Child Find identification process, but that some school districts were in different stages of implementation or that the approach was being used differently by schools within the same districts.
The Coast Guard's Specialized Forces include units that deploy from shore to carry out missions such as drug interdiction, port security, and defense readiness. GAO was asked to review the Coast Guards deployment of these units. This report examines (1) the extent to which the U.S. Coast Guard has applied key practices for agency reorganization when reorganizing its Deployable Specialized Force (Specialized Forces) units and (2) whether there is unnecessary overlap or duplication among these unitsthat is, whether there are gaps or overlap in capabilitiesand how these units could be better leveraged to meet mission requirements. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents and interviewed Coast Guard officials. The Coast Guard generally applied three of five key practices that GAO has identified as key for agency reform and partially applied two of five when developing its report that recommended the 2013 reorganization of its deployable specialized forces, but has not fully analyzed workforce needs or operational capabilities. For example, in 2011, Coast Guard analyzed its Specialized forces workforce needs and made recommendations to reduce the risk of drowning, among other things, but did not fully assess workforce needs because it did not assess the number of personnel required to conduct its operations. In addition, in 2013, when it reorganized its Specializing Forces, the Coast Coast Guard partially applied one of the five practices because it has not conducted the analyses necessary to fully identify potential overlap and the extent of which it could be unnecessarily duplicative. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard leadership have called for a comprehensive assessment of workforce needs to determine the optimal mix of units and analyze trade-offs, such as eliminating or moving underutilized units, which could identify opportunities for the CoastGuard to save millions of dollars over time. However, the exact amount of savings would depend on the outcomes of those analyses and cost data that is not currently available for making estimates, so GAO cannot precisely estimate the value of potential savings. Without comprehensively assessing workforce needs for its deployability Specialized force and determining the extent that overlap and duplication exist among its capabilities, the agency does not have the information it needs to identify capability gaps and reallocate resources, as needed, to use the units more efficiently. The report also found that the Coastguard may not be able to achieve greater efficiency or effectiveness by reducing or better managing programmatic fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, if any exists and is unnecessary. In its comments on a draft of this report, DHS concurred with one of GAO's two recommendations and described actions planned to address it. DHS did not concur with the other.
The E-Government Act of 2002 requires agencies, to the extent practical, to accept comments "by electronic means" and to make available online the public comments and other materials included in the official rulemaking dockets. The APA also requires that GAO report annually on the public comment process. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of identity information associated with the comment process for rulemaking proceedings. This report examines (1) how selected agencies treat identity information during the comment intake, comment analysis, and response to comments phases of the rulemaking process, and (2) the extent to which selected agencies' practices associated with posting identity information on Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites are documented and communicated to public users of the websites. To address these objectives, GAO surveyed 52 program offices with regulatory responsibilities in the 10 selected agencies that had issued at least one Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) from 2013 through 2017, reviewed agency websites, and interviewed agency officials. Within the discretion afforded by the Administrative Policy Act of 1974 (APA), the 10 agencies GAO reviewed--the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection agency (EPA, EPA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Wage and Hour Division (WHD)--collect some information from commenters and accept anonymous comments. Consistent with the discretion granted by the APA, the selected agencies use both required and optional fields on comment forms to collect some identity information. For example, while EPA does not make any fields associated with identity information available to commenters, CFPB makes all fields available and requires that commenters enter something into the first name, last name, and organization name fields before a comment can be submitted. Regardless of the fields required by the comment form, the agencies all accept Anonymous comments in practice. Specifically, a commenter can submit a comment under the name “Anonymous Anonymous,” enter a single letter in each required field, or provide a fabricated address. In each of these scenarios, as long as a character or characters are entered into the required fields, the comment will be accepted. Further, because theAPA does not require agencies to authenticate submitted identity information, neither Regulations.com nor the agency- specific websites contain mechanisms to check the validity of identity data that commenters submit through comment forms. The 10 agencies have implemented varied ways of posting identity data associated with public comments, particularly when it is associated with duplicate comments, which can lead to identity information being inconsistently presented on the websites of the agencies. For instance, EPA, for example, posts a single example for each set of duplicate comments and indicates the total number of comments received, but does not post all duplicate comments. As a result, the identity information and any unique comment content beyond the first example are not available to the public online. GA O reviewed the 10 federal agencies' comment websites and found that the selected agency-related practices associatedwith posting identity Information are not always documented or clearly communicated to the general public. Specifically: EPA's and FWS's websites do not provide detailed information about posting policies, and seven of the eight agencies direct public users back to their own websites for additional information about how to use the data they provide. In addition, one agency fully duplicates dockets on its own website, without informing users that the information may be found in a searchable database on the agency's website, and does not provide details about the process the agency uses to determine whether it will post all of the duplicate comments it receives. In contrast, SEC's and FCC's websites provide limited information about the posting processes associated with their respective comment systems, which could lead users to draw inaccurate conclusions about how the agencies considered public comments during the rule making process, limiting their ability to participate.
In fiscal year 2018, the federal government provided about $1.2 billion to school districts for school facilities, according to Education. Districts can use this funding for a wide range of school facilities projects, such as constructing, renovating, or replacing buildings. GAO was asked to review school facilities. This report examines: (1) the common facility condition issues school districts identify in public schools and how they have done so and (2) school districts' highest priorities for their school facility renovations and updates, and how districts and states fund them. To address these objectives, GAO surveyed all 50 states and the District of Columbia, surveyed a nationally representative sample of school districts, visited 16 school districts in six states, conducted building walkthroughs at 55 schools, and analyzed federal data on district expenditures for capital construction projects. In commenting on a draft of this report, Education as well as several state and district officials provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. School districts GAO visited frequently identified multiple building systems and features that need to be updated or replaced in their schools, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), roofing, interior lighting, and plumbing. Based on GAO's nationally representative survey of school Districts, GA O estimated that about half of districts (54 percent) need to update or replace at least two building systems in many of their schools. Further, about a quarter of districts need to improve or update at least six systems in at least half their schools (about 36,000 schools nationwide). For example, officials in one school district said about 60 percent of schools do not have air conditioning, and in 2019, some temporarily adjusted schedules due to extreme heat. In addition, about 30,000 of the 55 schools visited had HVAC systems that frequently malfunction or leak and damage flooring or ceiling tiles. Officials in several school districts said there are serious consequences to not maintaining or updating HVac systems, including lost educational time due to school closings and the potential for mold and air quality issues. School district officials said they prioritize safety and technology while also addressing repairs and modernization projects when updating or renovating schools. In response to a GAO survey, school districts identified security (92 percent), student access to technology (87 percent), monitoring hazards to student and staff health (78 percent), and improving telecommunication features such as wireless internet (74 percent) as their high priorities. In comparison, the 100 largest school districts (estimated 99 percent), which serve approximately 10.4 million students, identified security, monitoring health hazards, and completing projects to increase physical accessibility for students with disabilities as their top priorities. School Districts primarily used local funding to address school facility needs. About half (55 percent) of districts reported using local funding as their primary source for school facility projects, compared to state (36 percent) and federal (1 percent) funding. However, in some cases, local funding may not be sufficient to address facility needs, and officials in some districts said they have relied on state and federal funds to address these needs. In the six states GAO visits, officials described various challenges they faced in securing funding for school projects, including limited state-level funding and difficulty in finding local funding sources. State funding and guidance related to state- level priorities can affect school district decisions on facilities. For instance, five states reported requiring districts to use 3 percent or less of their general education funding for maintenance and operations, while one state reported requiring 6 percent, and one state did not know what percent.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Border Patrol and Air and Marine Operations (AMO) are responsible for securing the northern border between ports of entry between the United States and Canada. CBP's northern border sectors include areas of responsibility for air, maritime, and land operations. GAO was asked to review northern border security. This report addresses the following questions: (1) What threats has CBP identified along the U.S.-Canada (northern) border? (2) What challenges, if any, has CBC identified in its staffing and resources to secure its northern border? and what actions, ifany, have CBP taken to address those challenges? and (3) To what extent has CBp developed and implemented performance measures to assess the effectiveness of securing its northern borders? GAO reviewed DHS and CBP northern border policies, procedures, reports, and other documents; analyzed data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 on apprehensions and drug seizures; and interviewed CBP officials in headquarters and at eight northern border locations selected based on deployment of CBP resources and reported levels of illicit cross-border activity. According to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) 2017 Northern Border Threat Analysis Report, the most common threat to public safety along the northern borders continues to be contraband smuggling; specifically, the bidirectional flow of illicit drugs. Border Patrol, an agency within CBP, reported contraband trafficking as a significant threat along the border in its fiscal year 2018 intelligence reports for its eight northern Border Patrol sectors, including drug seizures and violations of immigration and travel controls along the northbound movement of foreign nationals into the country between ports. Border patrol agents apprehended 14,319 potentially removable aliens—foreign nationals who Border Patrol suspected or determined were removable from the UnitedStates—along the northern Border in fiscal year 2017, or approximately 1 percent of its total nationwide apprehensions of potentially removable individuals. CBp identified northern border staffing and resource challenges to its operations and enforcement activities and has identified actions to address them, but faces competing priorities with other southwest border security priorities. For example, in June 2018, DHS released a Northern Border Strategy to establish actions that are intended to, among other things, improve DHS's efforts to safeguard the northernborder against various threats. DHS is developing an implementation plan for its strategy that will identify actions for addressing gaps in capabilities to secure the border. However, it is unknown whether these northern border challenges will be addressed due to competing southwest border priorities, which are greatest on the southwest border. While CBP has performance measures (strategic and management) that assess certain border security operations or programs, some of which include data from the north border, it does not have specific measures that assess its effectiveness at securing the north-facing border. Specifically, Border Patrol has two strategic measures that include northern border data, but these measures do not assess Border Patrol's effectiveness in securing the North American northern border. In 2012 GAO recommended that Border Patrol establish milestones and time frames for developing new performance measures for border security, and Border Patrol made progress in developing new measures, but GAO closed the recommendations as not implemented in September 2017 because the measures identified did not apply to the entire northern or coastal borders, as well as the remaining uncertainty about when Border Patrol would develop a new strategic plan. In addition, CBP and AMO have ongoing efforts to develop border security metrics pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The act directs DHS to annually report metrics and associated data and methodology, including metrics for borderSecurity between ports, and consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010, agencies should establish a balanced set of performance measures, which reinforces the need for agencies to have a variety of measures across program areas. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should determine whether performance measures are appropriate for evaluating the entity's performance using targets and milestones. Developing and implementing northern border performance measures could help Border Patrol assess northern border operations and take corrective actions, as necessary.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Public Assistance program provides grants to state, territorial, local, and tribal governments as well as certain types of private nonprofit organizations to assist with responding to and recovering from presidentially-declared major disasters or emergencies. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 authorized the use of alternative procedures in administering this program, thereby providing new flexibilities to FEMA, states, territories, and local governments for debris removal, infrastructure repair, and rebuilding projects using funds from this program. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the Public Assistance alternative procedures program in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). This statement addresses (1) the status of FEMA's Public Assistance grant funding for Puerto Rico's and the USVI's recovery from the 2017 hurricanes and (2) the extent to which FEMA has addressed challenges with implementing the program and alternative procedures. This statement is based on GAO's prior and ongoing work issued from January 2017 through June 2019. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and other documents and interviewed FEMA and USVI officials. As of April 2019, FEMA had obligated a total of about $7.4 billion in grant funds for Public Assistance projects in both Puerto Rican and the United StatesVI. Puerto Rico had expended approximately $3.5 billion—about 61 percent of total grant obligations—for 1,264 projects, while the US VI had expended about $982.4 million for 583 projects. FEMA obligated approximately $6.2 billion for emergency work projects in the territory and $1.1 billion in the US Virgin Islands. Emergency work projects focused on debris removal activities and providing assistance to address immediate threats to life and property. In contrast, permanent work projects—which represent the longer-term repair and restoration of public infrastructure—focused on the restoration of disaster-damaged infrastructure or systems, such as roads, bridges, and utilities. As the recipients of federal disaster funding, Puerto Rico has established recovery offices to oversee and monitor recovery efforts. In March 2019, we reported that Puerto Rico, in accordance with Amendment 5 to the President's disaster declaration, established the Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction, and Resilience (COR3) to oversee federal recovery funds. We also reported that COR3 was developing an internal controls plan to help ensure better management and accountability of the funds. The USVI established the Office of Disaster Recovery in February 2019 to oversee the territory's recovery efforts and coordinate across all USVI governmental agencies and other pertinent entities. Public Assistance challenges remain, but FEMA has taken some actions to improve program implementation, including issuing additional guidance and developing specific training, among other things, to improve Public Assistance implementation. For example, in June 2019 GAO reported that FEMA and local officials have reported challenges with the implementation of the flexibilities authorized by section 20601 of the Bip bipartisan budget act of 2018. This section of the Act allows for the provision of assistance to restore disaster damaged facilities or systems that provide critical services—such as medical and educational facilities—to an industry standard without regard to pre-disaster condition. Preliminary observations from our ongoing work indicate that FEMA has obligated funding for four alternative procedures project projects in Puerto Puerto Rico as of May 2019 and two projects in USVI. GAO also reported in March 2019 that officials from FEMA, COR3, and municipalities said they experienced initial challenges in the recovery process, including concerns about lack of experience and knowledge of the alternative procedures; and concerns about missing, incomplete, or conflicting guidance from FEMA on the alternatives. In addition, in our June 2019 testimony statement, we continued to report on these challenges and preliminary observations indicate that these challenges continue. For instance, officials from Puerto Rico’s government agencies told us they did not feel they had sufficient guidance on the FEMA public assistance program, and where they did, written and verbal FEMA guidance was inconsistent or conflicting. FEMA officials stated that the agency has developed specific guidance for disaster recovery and that there are various ways, including in-person meetings, where officials can obtain clarification.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances health care for certain low-income and medically needy individuals, including those with disabilities and certain high-expenditure beneficiaries. In fiscal years 2009 through 2011, the most expensive 5 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries consistently accounted for almost half of the expenditures for all Medicaid beneficiaries and were much more likely to have certain conditions—such as asthma, diabetes, and behavioral health conditions—than all other beneficiaries enrolled only in Medicaid. GAO was asked to review states' efforts to manage the cost and quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries with high expenditures. This report examines (1) how selected states and managed care organizations (MCOs) and the accountable care organization (ACO) have identified or predicted high expenditure Medicaid beneficiaries, and (2) the extent to which selected states have used care management and other strategies to manage care for these beneficiaries. To do this work, GAO interviewed officials from seven selected states, five MCOs, and the ACO; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and other documents; and interviewed CMS officials. The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Officials from most of the seven selected state Medicaid agencies, five of the six MCOS, and four of the five ACO said they used risk scores to identify or predict high expenditure beneficiaries. Risk scores are measures of beneficiaries' health status, such as whether they have a chronic condition, and are enrolled in Medicaid, Medicare, or CHIP. Officials said they identified high- Expenditure Medicaid beneficiaries by examining service utilization data to identify statistical outliers or trends. For example, officials said they looked for beneficiaries whose utilization appeared to be significantly higher or lower compared with other beneficiaries with similar characteristics. Officials also said that after they identified outliers, they examined the reasons for those beneficiaries' utilization patterns to better understand why those beneficiaries were outliers and to take corrective action if appropriate. Care management programs can be used as efforts to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of health care services delivered to high expenditures beneficiaries, with the aim of improving outcomes and achieving cost savings. Officials GAO spoke with from all of the selected states reported that they provided care management for high expenditures in their fee-for-service delivery systems, for example, by assessing patient needs and coordinating care across providers, in an attempt to manage costs and ensure quality care. In addition to care management, some states used other strategies, including coverage policy changes, payment incentives, and restrictions on the number of providers certain beneficiaries could use. Across states that evaluated these efforts, results were mixed. Officials in Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Vermont, and Washington said their assessments of their efforts showed positive results such as cost savings or reductions in the use of expensive services, while officials in other states reported mixed or inconclusive findings. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) offered optional tools, as well as technical assistance and other educational resources to help states identify or better manage high expenditures Medicaid beneficiaries. The Medicaid Health Home State Plan Option, authorized under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, allowed states to design health home programs to provide comprehensive care coordination for beneficiaries with chronic conditions. The Financial Alignment Initiative, a CMS-supported effort to improve Medicaid service delivery, was designed to achieve savings for both Medicare and Medicaid, with one state using the initiative to target high-cost, high-risk Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries. CMS also offered states access to several resources that, while not designed specifically to target these beneficiaries, have been used to support states in identifying or better managing care for this population. These resources included the Medicaid Innovation Accelerator Program, the State Data Resource Center, and an initiative to integrate Medicaid and Medicare data to enhance care coordination and reduce costs for the dually eligible population.
The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars per year to equip and staff approximately 70 new medical facilities to better reflect its focus on outpatient and specialized care. GAO was asked to review VHA's process for activating new facilities, which is one of the key steps that must occur before veterans can access care at these facilities. This report examines (1) the costs of the activations at selected VHA medical facilities and (2) the extent to which VHA has processes and clear definitions to estimate and oversee total activation costs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed VHA documents and interviewed officials from eight VHA facilities selected based on size, location, and type of facility. The eight facilities were selected to reflect a range of sizes and types of services, and VHA provided technical comments on a draft of this report. VHA lacks processes to develop total activation cost estimates for major projects and to compare actual costs against these estimates. For example, VHA does not have a process for developing an estimate for the entire activation cost of a project, which can be a critical baseline that can inform future spending decisions. In addition, the Activations Office has not clearly defined what officials at local facilities can purchase with activation funding and how long activation funding should continue after opening day. Officials from two of the eight facilities told GAO that there were times when they did not know if they should charge an expense to activation or another funding source, such as construction accounts. In mid-2019, an internal review found that the lack of clarity regarding what could or could not be purchased should be remedied; however, as of September 2019, no specific plans have been established to define appropriate purchases. Without processes for estimating total costs and comparing them against actual expenses, VA is limited in its ability to improve resource planning, budgeting, and allocation—critical elements that support VA's stated management priority to enhance data-driven decision-making. Clear definitions on what expenses facilities should charge to activation accounts, and for how long, would also improve the activation office's ability to monitor costs and improve resource stewardship. VA concurred with all of GAO's recommendations and provided information on how it intends to address them, with target dates for completion in December 2020. The facilities included in this review provided most medical services within planned time frames, but nearly one-third of services were delayed for various reasons. Overall, 59 of the 87 services were offered within expected time frames (69 percent). The remaining service—a clinic that provides colonoscopy and other related procedures at one facility—opened on schedule approximately 11 months after opening. This facility was replacing another facility that had not previously offered this service. Officials explained that because the service was new, they needed more time to develop and equip the space as well as hire staff, so they planned on offering this service later than services that were being transferred from the previous facility. Officials said that once a facility begins providing medical care, activation tasks typically include on-the-job training in the new space and making necessary adjustments to the facility to ensure it runs properly while concurrently serving new patients.
In 2017, transit agencies provided over 10 billion rides to people traveling to and from businesses, homes, and other locations throughout the United States, according to FTA. Transit infrastructure for those rides includes railways, roads, bridges, tunnels, and stations. The transit workforce consists of a variety of occupations, such as bus operators, train conductors, dispatchers, mechanics, supervisors, and others. FTA supports transit agencies' workforce development by providing financial and technical assistance, among other things. GAO was asked to review transit workforce issues. This report addresses: (1) the extent to which information exists about future transit workforce needs, (2) the actions selected transit stakeholders are taking to address current and future transit needs, and (3) FTA's efforts to assist transit agencies with identifying and addressing these needs. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed key DOT and FTA documents such as strategic plans, annual reports to Congress, and public presentations, and interviewed officials from DOT, FTA, the Office of the Secretary, and six transit stakeholders selected based on geographic diversity, transit workforce grants awarded, and transit workforce expertise. The extent of future transit-specific workforce needs is unclear due to the absence of workforce projections, unclear communication on the data that are available, and because the available data do not extend past 2022. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) have taken a number of actions to help address future workforce needs for the transit industry, but the transit stakeholders GAO interviewed identified ongoing recruiting and retention challenges. For example, in fiscal year 2017, FTA provided over $29 million in technical assistance and standards development, training, and workforce development projects to help transit agencies recruit, train, and retain transit workers. However, transit stakeholders cited ongoing challenges with recruiting and retaining transit workers, including a lack of information on the number of transit workers who will need to be hired in the future. DOT's Transportation Industry Report, released in August 2015, projected a total of 1 million job openings in the transit and ground passenger transportation sector from 2012 to 2022 and listed the top 10 projected job openings, but these projections include occupations within services that are statutorily excluded from the definition of transit. The three largest categories of job openings have the following key transit exclusions: School bus and special client bus drivers made up approximately 33 percent of the projected openings (330,699 job openings). However, school bus services are specifically excluded, as are sightseeing services, charter bus services, courtesy shuttle services for patrons of one or more specific establishments, and intra-terminal or intra-facility shuttle services. Transit and intercity bus drivers make up almost 20 percent (199,727 job openings), but intercity buses (for example, Greyhound bus service) are excluded. Taxi drivers and chauffeurs made up almost 19 percent (188,895 job openings) but may not meet the statutory definition for transit. FTA has not always made clear that the data in the Transportation Industry report combine both transit andground passenger transportation data, though this was not intentional. FTA officials told GAO that the report was intended to provide trend information and that they do not plan to use the transit numbers from the report in future reports and presentations. Federal Internal Control Standards highlight the importance of using quality information to make informed decisions and identifying the information requirements needed to do so while considering the expectations of internal and external users. While the views of stakeholders we interviewed varied on the need for additional transit workforce data and projections, new transit workforce projections could inform decision-making on transit workforce planning to address potential future shortages or other needs. FTA does not have a comprehensive transit workforce strategy showing the operations and processes to be developed to guide its efforts to help agencies address workforce needs. Federal internal control standards indicate that plans should set up the effective and efficient operations necessary to fulfill desired objectives. Without a comprehensive strategy, FTA lacks a roadmap to help ensure it is effectively leveraging its resources to address future needs. In addition, FTA's performance goals and measures for its transit workforce development efforts are not clearly defined and are not tied to performance goals that it expects the grants to achieve.
The Balanced Budget Act of 2018 (2018 BBA) requires GAO to report annually on Medicare spending on LCCP-type services. The 2018 BBA also includes a provision that GAO review Medicare's physician fee schedule. This report examines the extent to which (1) Medicare spending for these services increased from 2013 through 2017 and (2) stakeholders believe a new billing code is needed for the service as defined in the BBA. GAO analyzed Medicare spending data from 2013 to 2017, the most recent year for which complete data were available; reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; and interviewed stakeholders representing a range of providers, including national umbrella groups of physicians and other providers, national associations of health care providers, and state and local governments. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Medicare spending increased from $26 billion in 2013 to $29 billion in 2017, an 11 percent increase. The vast majority of this spending (about $28.3 billion) was on services represented by the 45 broadly-defined codes GAO identified earlier (henceforth referred to as “broadly-defined services”). By comparison, spending on the 13 narrowly-defined service codes (narrowly- defined services) was about $467 million in 2017. Though smaller in terms of total dollars, spending in 2017 on narrowly defined services grew at a higher rate than spending on broadly defined services, from about $2 per beneficiary to $14 per beneficiary. This higher rate in growth can mostly be attributed to four new types of services being introduced during this 4-year period. For example, two of these new services were introduced in 2013 and four of them were introduced from 2015 to 2017. In addition, the number of Medicare providers billing for these narrowly- defined service codes increased from about 31,000 to 100,000 between 2013 and 2017, and the overall number of providers billed for these codes increased by 227 percent. In 2017, about 2.5 million beneficiaries received narrowly-definition services, representing an 839 percent increase from about 267,000 beneficiaries in 2013. In contrast, only 10 percent of beneficiaries received multiple types of these services, with the most common combination being a single type of service (e.g., an evaluation and management (E/M) or chronic care management (CCM) code). The number of provider billing codes for narrowly-defined services also increased significantly during this period, as these codes were established and began to be utilized during this time. The majority of providers who billed for narrowlydefined services in 2017 were in nonfacility settings, such as physicians' offices. Stakeholders GAO interviewed had mixed views on whether a new code for the Longitudinal Comprehensive Care Planning (LCCP) service is needed. Six of the 19 stakeholders GAO contacted did not support the creation of a new coding system for the LCCC service. However, 13 of the 17 stakeholders who responded to this question stated that a new L CCP code could address several concerns they identified in Medicare's existing billing codes related to the provision of the service, including inadequate reimbursement for time spent on interdisciplinary care and other limitations identified in the existing codes. Some of these concerns could be addressed under the current Medicare billing framework, as shown by GAO's analysis of available data.
In July 2017, Equifax reported a data breach that compromised the personally identifiable information of at least 145.5 million individuals, including names, addresses, and Social Security numbers, and credit card, driver's license, and social security numbers. Equifax's public filings after the breach noted that the company took steps to improve security and notify individuals about the breach. In February 2019, GAO reported that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had taken actions against companies that allegedly engaged in unfair or deceptive practices relating to data protection. GAO was asked to testify on the data breach at Equifax. This testimony is based on GAO's February 2019 report (GAO-2019-10-619 ). Specifically, it addresses (1) data breaches and the Equifax breach, (2) FTC's enforcement of consumer protection laws, (3) CFPB's enforcement and examination of consumer credit reporting agencies (CRAs), and (4) how regulators inform consumers about protections available and how consumers can take some actions after a CRA data breach. To address these objectives, this testimony is primarily based on prior GAO reports issued from January 2009 through February 2019. Although there is no commonly agreed-upon definition of “data breach,” the term generally refers to an unauthorized or unintentional exposure, disclosure, or loss of sensitive information. A data breach can be inadvertent, such as from the loss of an electronic device; or deliberate, suchAs the theft of a device or a cyber-based attack by individuals or groups, including an organization's own employees, foreign nationals, or terrorists. Data breaches have occurred at all types of organizations, including private, nonprofit, and federal and state entities. For example, in August 2018, the Social Security Administration (SSA) reported a breach of sensitive personal information at the credit reporting agency Equifax, which resulted in the disclosure of personal information for more than 140 million individuals. In addition, in February 2019 GAO found that FTC has taken enforcement measures against CRAs but lacks civil penalty authority for the privacy and safeguarding provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that would allow FTC to impose civil money penalties for violations of GLBA's privacy and safeguard provisions. FTC and consumers would benefit if FTC had such authority, and GAO recommended that Congress consider providing FTC with such authority in its report. In January 2009, Congress did not provide FTC with this authority in the final adoption of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). GAO noted that this authority would give FTC a practical tool to more effectively enforce GLBA provisions related to security of data and consumer information. Since the 2008 financial crisis, Congress introduced several bills that would have given FTC civil penalty authorities for its enforcement of the GLBA, including those related to data security and identity theft, but did not include this authority. In its February 2019 review of CFP B's examinations of CRAs for compliance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), GAO concluded that the agency does not fully consider data security in its examination prioritization process. In particular, the process does not routinely include assessments of how institutions detect and respond to cyber threats, as called for by federal law and federal internal control standards. In light of this and other recent data breaches, including that of Equifax and others, it is important for the agency to routinely consider factors that could inform the extent of CRA data security risk such as the number of consumers that could be affected by a data security incident and the nature of potential harm resulting from its loss or exposure of information. In GAO-19-10 , GAO made a number of recommendations to improve the agency's data security process, including to assess whether its process for prioritizing CRA examinations sufficiently incorporates the data security risks CRAs pose to consumers, and take any needed steps identified by the assessment to more sufficiently incorporate these risks. In response to GAO recommendations, the agency has not yet assessed its process to determine how to incorporate such risks going forward.
Employment-related identity fraud can have negative impacts on victims and poses risks to both the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Victims may face IRS enforcement actions or a reduction in benefits for some federal programs based on wages earned by fraudsters. The full scope of this fraud is unknown. GAO was asked to review this issue. This report examines (1) the potential scope of employment-related fraud, including what IRS knows about this type of fraud and what GAO could determine by analyzing the Department of Health and Human Services' National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) and IRS data; (2) SSA's actions to detect and deter this fraud as well as notify victims; (3) IRS actions to deter and detect this fraud and notify victims as well; and (4) the extent to which SSA and IRS are collaborating to address the issue. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant agency documents, interviewed agency officials, and analyzed NDNH data from August to October 2016 on 122.8 million SSNs and W-2s for individuals who were employed in the United States between August and October 2016, the oldest data for which relevant IRS tax data were available at the time of GAO's review. More than 2.9 million Social Security numbers (SSNs) had risk characteristics associated with SSN misuse and evidence of employment activity in tax year 2016 based on GAO analysis of NDNH verified quarterly wage records for 122. 8 million individuals. The risk characteristics included individuals who had wages reported for three or more employers in the same quarter; individuals who are deceased; individuals under age 14; and individuals over age 84. Further, more than a million of those SSNs were also at risk of not meeting all IRS tax return requirements, such as reporting all associated wage information. However, IRS did not identify all of those noncompliant returns. Employment- related identity fraud has limited tax consequences, but GAO found that federal income tax withholding was lower for SSNs that did not declare all related W- 2s in 2016 than for those with all related SSNs reported. For example, 37,868 individuals had at least one related wage record that was not declared on a tax return and withheld no federal income taxes over the course of the year. These individuals earned approximately $340 million in 2016. IRS does not systematically track these situations for several reasons. First, unless a taxpayer contacts IRS to say he or she did not earn the wages and disclaims them, the agency does not know whether a suspected case is employment-based identity fraud or someone who may not have included legitimate wages on his or her tax return. Second, IRS may be unable to distinguish between fabricated W-1s for jobs that were not worked (i.e., fake employees of a fake business). Third, while IRS officials told GAO that other types of identity fraud may be a more widespread problem than the ITIN/SSN mismatch that IRS currently tracks, IRS officials said other types would be identified and addressed through processes the agency applies broadly to all taxpayers. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should use quality information that is appropriate and complete to achieve the entity's objectives, and that it should communicate quality information externally. By modifying the title of its employment-Related identity theft action code to more accurately reflect the data covered by the code, IRS can ensure that the agency is appropriately conveying the risk this specific type of IDT poses both to victims and tax administration without suggesting its statistics cover other types. SSA is taking steps to better detect and detect potential fraud, but faces challenges addressing the risks associated with some victims. For instance, SSA posts the wage information to the Earnings Suspense File, a database that SSA uses to determine an individual's eligibility for Social Security benefits and the amount of benefits paid. For individuals determined to be inaccurate, S SA posts the information to IRS, which uses this information to follow up with individuals who appear to owe taxes but have not filed returns or have filed returns but underreported earnings. In fiscal year 2018, the most recent year for which data are available, IRS followed up with about 892,000 or 0.6 percent of all individual income tax returns for individuals with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), a tax processing number issued by IRS to individuals who do not have and are not eligible to obtain a Social Security number from
The Department of Defense's (DOD) Blended Retirement System (BRS) is a new retirement system for active-duty servicemembers that replaces the legacy retirement system. Under BRS, eligible retirees receive a monthly benefit equal to 2 percentage points per year of service multiplied by the average of a servicemember's highest 36 months of basic pay—lower than the 2.5 percentage point multiplier under the legacy system. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's implementation of BRS. This report addresses (1) what actions DOD has taken to help BRS-eligible servicemen understand the system and educate them on saving for retirement; (2) what DOD can learn from financial literacy training effective practices and the implementation of training to continue supporting BRS; and (3) how lump-sum payment amounts are determined under BRS and how they compare to the methods used for private-sector pension plans that offer them. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents; interviewed DOD officials; and conducted site visits to five military installations. DOD used a multi-faceted approach to implement BRS training and outreach campaigns and is developing continuing financial literacy education for BRS enrollees. DOD developed three courses to help eligible BRS retirees make informed decisions about whether to opt into BRS or remain in the legacy pension system. DOD also created a central website that links to outreach material in a variety of media formats, including videos available on YouTube, social media content, an interactive online comparison calculator, webinars, and external websites such as Military OneSource and https://www.tsp.gov. DOD's Office of Financial Readiness also trained financial counselors across the service branches to supplement the information in its BRS trainings as well as to provide in-person financial literacy support. DOD officials said that the agency employs at least one financial literacy professional at most military installations or uses government contractors to provide support at multiple installations. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2016 requires DOD to provide ongoing financial literacy and retirement-related training for all new recruits. DOD is also developing a plan to provide continuing financial education on savings for retirement at various career and life stages, including at initial entry, promotions, vesting in the Thrift Savings Plan, eligibility for continuation pay, marriage, divorce, and the birth of a first child. BRS's lump- sum payment option is a time-limited, partial payment option that allows eligible military retirees with 20 or more years of service to convert part of their monthly annuity into a lump sum payment, in exchange for a temporarily lower monthly benefit. The lump-Sum payment is partial in two ways: 1) military retirees may convert either 25 or 50 percent of their annuity payments to a lump- Sum payment, and 2) the lump sum conversion only applies to annuities payable prior to the military's Social Security full retirement age (FRA)—age 67 for those born in 1960 or later. After the service member reaches FRA, the annuity payment revert to the full monthly pension. The BRS lump sum is limited and the full annuity amount would resume at the full FRA retirement age, but the reduced annuity paid until then could still have a significant impact on some military retirees' financial security. DOD has not yet evaluated the results of its financial literacy assessments to determine where gaps in the military population's financial knowledge exist and revise future trainings to address these gaps. The method used to determine BRS Lump Sums is likely to result in a discount rate that is higher—based on recent interest rates, roughly double—than that used to calculate minimum lump sum distributions from private- sector pension plans, when all other factors are equal. The discount rates for determining minimum lump sums are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). DOD officials told GAO that they considered several factors to set the discount rate for lump sums, such as the likelihood that a lumpsum payment would lead more people to retire earlier than they would otherwise. However, DOD officials also said the agency relies on maintaining a certain percentage of service members and did not want to entice too large a percentage of those leaving military service to leave military service. DOD can take certain steps to help current active- duty service members better understand the tradeoffs associated with the lump- SUM option. For example, DOD posted a training video
The election process relies on various assets—such as information technology systems, networks, equipment, and facilities—that can be broadly categorized as physical, cyber, and human components of the Election Infrastructure Subsector. These assets and components are susceptible to a variety of unintentional, or nonadversarial, and intentional threats, such as equipment failures, software coding errors, or the accidental actions of employees (human errors. Threat sources also include natural disasters and other events that can cause failure within sectors on which the election infrastructure is dependent. GAO was asked to review the federal government's efforts to secure election infrastructure in advance of the 2020 elections. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken steps to assist states and local election jurisdictions in securing their election infrastructure, and (2) the benefits and challenges that selected election officials have identified in DHS's election security assistance efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed officials from DHS, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Election Security Initiative (CISA), and selected state and local jurisdictions. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provided insights on selected election security efforts. DHS, through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is the lead federal agency for the Election infrastructure subsector. CISA is responsible for coordinating partnership activities and information sharing and is the primary federal interface with the subsector's stakeholders with respect to security. For example, CISA provides cybersecurity assessments, training, and other services to states and election jurisdictions. State election officials with whom GAO spoke were generally satisfied with CISA's support to secure their election systems. Specifically, officials from seven of the eight states GAO contacted said that they were very satisfied with the agency's election-related work, while officials from the eighth state said they were somewhat satisfied. Officials from five states told GAO that their relationship with CISA had improved markedly since early 2017, when the elections subsector was established. In addition, election officials from six states said that CISA has helped them to assure voters that elections in their states are secure or to promote election security. However, officials also identified two challenges linked to DHS's assistance efforts, including finding time to schedule election security services and providing security briefings to state officials with security clearances leading up to the 2018 elections. According to CISA officials, the agency has been working with the Intelligence Community to rapidly declassify relevant intelligence or provide as much intelligence as possible, at the lowest classification level possible, to election officials. In October 2019, a CISA senior cybersecurity advisor testified that DHS has begun working with cybersecurity intelligence firms to provide election security information without the need for national securityclearances or travel to secure facilities. Further, while CISA intends to finalize its strategic and operations plans by January 2020, it has not yet completed these plans. In the absence of completed plans, a senior CISA official in one region stated in October 2019 that the region is moving forward with its own strategy because the 2020 election cycle is scheduled to start with state primary elections in the region in March 2020. Until CISA finalizes its plans for supporting elections in 2020 and ensures that the operations plan fully addresses all of the aspects of its strategic plan, it will not be well-positioned to execute a nationwide strategy for securing election infrastructure prior to the start of 2020 election activities.
Flood risk management involves the appropriate use of structures such as levees and floodwalls, as well as nonstructural measures such as land acquisition and structure relocation, to reduce the risk of loss of life, reduce long-term economic damage to the public and private sectors, and improve the natural environment. Flood risk management is one of the Corps' three primary missions. For fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Corps requested more than $3 billion for 71 construction projects that fell within its three missions, of which the largest amount—$1.33 billion—was for 33 construction projects in the flood risk management mission. GAO was asked to review the economic analyses the Corps conducted in its feasibility studies for flood risk projects. This report examines (1) the extent to which the eight studies GAO reviewed included economic analyses consistent with best practices and (2) how the Corps identified and evaluated the economic, environmental, and other effects of alternative plans for proposed flood projects. To conduct this review, GAO analyzed economic analyses for eight studies conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and interviewed Corps officials. The economic analyses in the eight Corps feasibility studies reviewed generally met three of the five key methodological elements in GAO's Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis and partly met two key elements in the analysis of effects and transparency. For example, all eight studies included a plain language summary and all eight analyses included tables that generally described data and results. However, the studies did not fully align with certain best practices, such as quantifying the statistical variability underlying the results of the comparison of alternatives. The Corps' Planning Guidance states that studies should consider the alternative plan with the greatest net economic benefit, consistent with protecting the nation's environment, unless an exception is granted. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works has the authority to grant exceptions if federal, state, local, or international concerns exist. In most of the studies reviewed, however, three studies relied on other analyses to address different project objectives or the preferences of the local nonfederal sponsors. These included the Environmental Quality, Regional Economic Development, and Other Social Effects analyses. Corps officials said the additional analyses were included in studies because the analyses were needed to determine the best project design, help make planning decisions, or respond to local sponsors' preferences. In the eight feasibility studies, the most commonly included monetary benefits were reduced damages and emergency costs avoided, while nonmonetary costs were not commonly considered. For instance, some studies considered reduced maintenance costs, flood insurance administrative savings, or reduced transportation disruptions, but these were not most commonly considered in their economic analyses. In addition to the required economic analysis of benefits and costs, the Army Corps also included other analyses in its studies to evaluate monetary and nonmon monetary project effects. The Army Corps' followed the six-step planning process for water resources development projects outlined in its planning guidance to identify and evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of proposed alternative plans and select a recommended plan for the 8 feasibility studies we reviewed. According to Corps guidance, the initial three steps of the planning process are to identify the objectives and other parameters of the project, inventoried and forecasted water and related land resources conditions within the planning area, and formulate alternative plans. The final three steps are to evaluate and analyze each alternative plan for its economic and environmental effects, compared the alternative plans to each other, and selected a plan to be further considered. In all 8 studies, economic analyses of monetary effects generally resulted in an estimated net dollar value of benefits (benefits minus costs) expected with each alternative in place, while the analyses of non-monetary effects resulted in a Corps judgment about the net qualitative effect or net quantitative effect (e.g., net units of habitat created) for each alternative. In some studies, this comparison included an incremental process in which the Corps considered incorporating additional measures or approaches into an alternative to further optimize the trade-off between beneficial or adverse effects. In one study, the study included a qualitative discussion of the effects of alternatives on loss of lives, but one did not include an assessment of these effects. A recent National Academy of Sciences study on coastal storm flooding indicated that the practice of quantifying and valuing reductions in loss ofLife is widespread in the federal government, allowing these risk reductions to be included in the economic analysis. Corps issued revised guidance in July 2017 requiring studies to include a quantitative assessment of losses when they are a significant factor.
The federal Health Center Program, established in the mid-1960s to help low-income individuals gain access to health care services, is administered by HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care and makes grants to four types of health centers: 1. community health centers, 2. health centers for the homeless, 3. health center for residents of public housing and individuals living in areas immediately accessible to public housing, 4. migrant health centers. These health centers provide primary care to migratory agricultural workers (individuals whose principal employment is in agriculture and who establish temporary residences for work purposes) and seasonal agricultural workers. HRSA also provides grants to health centers to help them provide services to patients who are uninsured or not typically reimbursed by other payers, such as adult dental care or other services such as transportation and nutritional education. GAO was asked to review HRSA funding for health centers through the CHCF. This report examines (1) the revenue received by health centers from 2010 through 2017 and (2) the extent to which HRSA awarded CHCF grants in fiscal years 2011 through 2017 to support health centers and (3) the number of new health center sites added in the United States from fiscal year 2011 to 2017. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed HRSA data on CHCF funding for fiscal years 2010 to 2017 and interviewed HRSA officials and officials from the Congressional Research Service, George Washington University's Milken Institute, the National Association of Community Health Centers, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Total revenue received from health centers more than doubled from calendar years 2010-2017—from about $12.7 billion to $26.3 billion—but the share of revenue from grants decreased from 38.0 percent of total revenue in 2010 to about 30.2 percent in 2017. During the same time period, the total number of patients served at health centers increased by 7.7 million patients, from 19.5 million to 27.2 million. Health centers also received about $15.8 billion in grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) through the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) for the 7-year period from fiscal years2011 through 2017. The majority of this funding—$12.6 billion, or nearly 80 percent—was awarded for the purpose of service area funding, which supports ongoing operations and services across the nearly 1,400 health centers nationwide. The remaining $3.2 billion was awarded to increase the amount of services provided at existing health centers or for other special initiatives such as health information technology. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, HRSA provided about $1.1 billion in CHCF funds to help establish new health centers at existing centers, including about $648 million for new access points (NAP) awards, which allow a new organization to become a health center or an existing health center to add one or more service sites. In addition, about $411.3 million was awarded for construction grants to help existing centers alter, renovate, expand, or construct a facility. Health center officials told GAO that these awards are used to fill the gap between what it costs to operate a center and what a center receives in revenue. As such, the awards are a primary means through which health centers are able to provide services that may be uncompensated, including services for uninsured patients or services not typically covered by public health insurance such as dental care. Collectively, a total of 5,536 new sites were added to the U.S. health care system through fiscal year 2017. Of these new sites, 3,838 were in urban locations and 1,698 were in rural locations. While many of these sites were from NAP awards, other grants may have contributed to the establishment of new sites as well. For example, health centers may be added through a change of scope to their service area competition award or through other types of grants funded by the CH CF. However, according to HRSA, the data do not allow for directly associating these grants as the grants may be used for multiple purposes.
SEC is responsible for protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation. Among its efforts, SEC requires public companies to disclose meaningful financial and other information to the public, examines firms it regulates, and identifies and investigates potential violations of federal securities laws. Each year, SEC brings hundreds of enforcement actions—including judicial enforcement actions and administrative proceedings—against individuals and companies as a result of its investigations. GAO was asked to review SEC's public reporting of enforcement statistics. This report examines (1) the extent to which SEC has documented procedures for recording and verifying enforcement-related data in its central database, (2) how SEC has reported and presented enforcement statistics since 2009, and (3) the steps SEC has taken to document procedures for generating its annual report and verifying the statistics used in it. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed SEC reports from 2009 through 2018 that included enforcement statistics and interviewed SEC staff. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Division of Enforcement (Enforcement) has documented a number of procedures for the recording and verification of enforcement data, but it does not have written procedures for public reporting. Enforcement staff stated that the report is not required by law and is discretionary. However, federal internal control standards identify documentation—including documentation that demonstrates procedures are being implemented—as a necessary part of an effective internal control system and as a means to help detect and prevent errors. For example, Enforcement staff said that the division's co-directors hold regular weekly meetings with their staff to discuss management of the division. Staff said program metrics and other measures may be discussed at these meetings, including the types of information and statistics that might be used in the Enforcement Annual Report. According to Enforcement staff, at the end of the fiscal year the co- Directors determine what information andStatistics the division will include in reports. Once decisions have been made about the annual report's content, a contractor uses software queries of the database to compile statistics for the report based on data parameters defined by Enforcement staff. Staff then add the compiled statistics to the draft annual report, which is then sent to the Office of Public Affairs for formatting and publication. SEC staff said they were confident about the reliability of report data because staff were familiar with enforcement data and the informal processes they currently use to verify accuracy. In contrast, Enforcement uses documented SEC guidelines for reviewing and verifying data used to support performance metrics in the agency-wide SEC Annual Performance Report. Documenting written procedures would provide Enforcement with greater assurance that staff follow necessary steps to help ensure the reliability and accuracy of reported information. Reliability and accuracy are important to maintaining the division’s credibility and public confidence in its efforts. Since 2009, SEC has made changes to how it reports and presents enforcement statistics, including creating a stand-alone enforcement annual report in 2017. In 2015, Enforcement changed how the report presented summary data for enforcement actions. Previously, Enforcement counted enforcement actions as civil actions or administrative proceedings. The fiscal year 2015 report separately identified and counted the proceedings as stand- standalone (initial) or follow-on (after initial action). The Select SEC and Market Data Report was discontinued after the 2017 report and the Enforcement annual report was first published in November 2017.
Mexico and the United States created the Mérida Initiative in 2007 to address crime and corruption in Mexico and to promote rule of law and human rights in the country. From fiscal years 2008 through 2010, the U.S. government provided about $591 million for the initiative, with the majority of this funding going to the Department of State's (State) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (State/INL) and the Agency for International Development (USAID) for projects focused on crime and violence prevention, human rights, and transparency and accountability. In fiscal year 2018, State and USAID allocated about $723 million for these projects. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the initiative. This report examines (1) the types of projects funded by State andUSAID for MérIDA Initiative projects active from fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) how these projects align with U. S. government-wide foreign assistance funding categories; and (3) the extent to which State and USID implemented these projects through contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, interagency agreements, and agreements with international organizations. To do this work, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, the Mexican government, Mexican nonprofit and private sector entities, and civil society groups. State and U.N. agency officials provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. State-funded projects in Mexico under the Departmentof State's Bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement Affairs' Office of the Inspector General (INL), known as State/InL, have focused on criminal justice, border and port security, professionalizing the police, and counternarcotics, among other areas. For example, in fiscal year 2014, State/inL funded projects to assist Mexico's transition to a newly reformed criminal justice system that includes oral arguments and the presumption of innocence, categorized by State as "criminal justice" and by USAID as "rule of law." In addition to projects related to criminal justice projects, most funding for USAID projects was for those that focused on other areas, such as human rights and transparency, and for those designed to engage with civil society to address crimes and violence, and corruption, and promote trust in government. These projects were implemented primarily through contracts and grants. USAID-funded Méridea Initiative projects focused primarily on four areas: crime and Violence Prevention, Rule of Law, Transparency and Accountability, Human Rights, and Human Rights. The projects with the highest percentage of USAID funding were those focused on Rule of law (39 percent) or Crime and Violence prevention (22 percent) with Transparency and accountability and Human rights constituting slightly smaller percentages (15 percent and 14 percent, respectively). For example: Crime andViolence Prevention: These projects, with estimated funding of $70 million, focused on training, technical assistance, and equipment for Mexican law enforcement, border security, justice sector, and military officials to improve their effectiveness, accountability, and adherence to the rule of the law. Human Rights: These 15 projects, estimated at $46 million, worked to advance human rights through various activities that, for example, aimed to help at-risk youth in communities and detention centers return to school, gain employment, and improve life skills. In addition, these projects also provided tools and guidance to civil society officials to promote a culture of lawfulness and trust in the justice system. Counternarc narcotics: These 76 projects, valued at $115 million, were focused on assisting Mexican agencies countering the illicit drug trade in Mexico, primarily through technical assistance and equipment, including for forensic labs, drug detection, and surveillance. These included projects to provide training and technical assistance to law enforcement officials to enhance their capacity to conduct drug detection and investigative activities, as well as equipment and training for military and border security officials to secure Mexico's air, land, and sea borders and ports. In contrast to these projects, State's Office of National Security/Defense, which provides direct funding for justice, national security/defense, and public order and domestic security, focused its efforts primarily on border and ports security and professionalize the police. These two categories of projects accounted for more than 80 percent of the $589 million in total funding for State/ INL projects active in Mexico from fiscal year 2010 through 2018.
Puerto Rico was devastated by hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017, causing an estimated $95 billion in damage. FEMA's Public Assistance program provides grant funding to state, territorial, local, and tribal governments, as well as certain types of private nonprofit organizations, to assist them in responding to and recovering from major disasters or emergencies. GAO was asked to review FEMA's efforts in Puerto Rico. This report examines, among other things, (1) the status of Public Assistance funding, (2) the extent to which FEMA's cost estimating guidance aligns with GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, (3) FEMA's policies and guidance for Puerto Rico, and (4) the structures Puerto Rico and FEMA have in place to manage and oversee Public Assistance. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FEMA's public assistance funding data as of September 30, 2019, and interviewed FEMA and Puerto Rico government officials. Since the 2017 hurricanes, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has obligated nearly $6 billion in Public Assistance for 1,558 projects across Puerto Rico to repair and restore public infrastructure, such as schools, roads, bridges, and public utilities. Puerto Rico has expended about $3.9 billion of this funding to reimburse subrecipients for completed work. Of this, Puerto Rico expended nearly $4.5 billion for emergency work projects, which focused on debris removal and providing assistance to address immediate threats to life and property. In contrast, permanent work projects take time to identify, develop, and ultimately complete as they represent the longer-term repair and restoration of public infrastructure. As of September 2019, FEMA had obligated approximately $5.1 billion in emergency work, $487 million in permanent work, and $315 million in management costs for projects in categories A through G. FEMA has taken steps to adapt its guidance to estimate costs to post-disaster conditions in Puerto Puerto, but has not fully aligned its cost-estimating guidance for Public Assistance projects with the 12 steps in the GAO Cost Guide, which outlines best practices for cost estimating. For example, FEMA's guidance does not fully or substantially meet the step to identify the ground rules and assumptions because it does not discuss the risk of an assumption being incorrect and the resultant effect on the cost estimate. FEMA officials stated that FEMA's use of RSMeans unit costs, a benchmark industry standard based on ongoing iterative analysis of construction costs nationwide, allows FEMA to account for fluctuations and uncertainties in the market. However, FEMA does not require that cost estimators examine the effect of changing assumptions and the effect these changes could have on a cost estimate as part of its cost estimating process. In addition, FEMA did not conduct a risk and uncertainty analysis to determine a range of possible costs and the level of confidence in achieving the estimate. While FEMA fully met nine of the 12 best practices, FEMA could improve its cost estimates guidance to ensure that all best practices are fully met. FEMA also partially met two and minimally met one of the best practices by not addressing all of the steps to obtain data to serve as the foundation of an estimate. In particular, FEMA guidance did not outline procedures for making sure data was validated using historical data as a benchmark for reasonableness and did not stipulate that data be normalized to remove the effects of inflation or analyzed with a scatter plot to determine trends and outliers. FEMA is in the process of developing a more dynamic and iterative future price curve, an analysis that will adjust as time goes on, to eventually replace the future price factor, but it is too soon to determine the impact this will have on current and future cost estimates. FEMA uses an industry standard cost database that is updated quarterly. Without adjusting these costs when better data becomes available consistent with the obtaining the data step, FEMA risks creating estimates that may not be based on accurate data. FEMA relies on the central recovery office to disseminate at least some of its guidance and policy to subrecipient entities, including municipalities and government agencies, but Puerto Rico officials GAO spoke with said that confusion persisted in part due to changing points of contact. Developing a repository of current applicable policy and guidance and making it available to all relevant recovery partners, including sub recipients, would improve the accessibility of the information and provide greater assurance that recovery partners are aware of current guidance. Following the hurricanes, Puerto Puerto Rico took several steps to provide management and oversight of the program to ensure the program is implemented in compliance with applicable
DOD's Office of the Chief Management Officer (OCMO) is responsible for leading the department's business reform efforts. In January 2019, GAO reported that OCMO had made progress in its reform efforts, but some reform teams lacked resources to fully implement approved initiatives. GAO recommended, and DOD concurred, that DOD establish a process to identify and prioritize funding for implementing its cross-functional teams' business reform initiatives. In August 2017, DOD issued its 921 plan, which identifies eight initiatives across the covered activities and generally addresses most of the elements required under section 921. Section 921 required the CMO to provide a plan, schedule, and cost estimate for conducting its reforms of covered activities. DOD's plan provides a schedule for all eight efforts, and provides a cost estimates for all but one, which OCMO officials indicated was still under development. The plan identifies costs of at least $116.3 million to $ 116.8 million to implement these initiatives through fiscal year 2021. The Senate Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the status of DOD's reforms. This report assesses the extent to which DOD has (1) implemented its plan and achieved cost savings and (2) fully funded some of the initiatives in its plan. To do this work,GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed OCMO and other DOD officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) has provided limited documentation of progress in implementing its plan to reform its business operations and achieve cost savings, and has not fully fund some plan initiatives. According to DOD, it is making progress implementing the plan's initiatives according to the schedules contained in the plan, and provided summary documentation stating that progress has been made on five of the eight initiatives. However, DOD did not provide sufficiently detailed documentation on the progress of the other four initiatives, and GAO was unable to independently assess and verify DOD's progress on any of these initiatives. For example, for the human resources regulatory reform, civilian hiring improvement, and human resources service delivery initiatives, OCMO provided briefing materials on thestatus of each milestone under the initiatives, indicating that those initiatives are progressing according to DOD's schedule. For the strategic sourcing of sustainment and commodity resources, maintenance work packages and bills of material, and munition readiness initiatives, however, DOD has not provided any documentation to support its assertion that these initiatives are on schedule or on track. DOD has stated that its broader business operations reform efforts—which are not limited to covered activities—will produce cost savings; however, it has provided only limited documentation to allow us to independently validate the savings. Specifically, in its budget materials for fiscal year 2020, released in March 2019, DOD reported that its reform effort had saved $4.7 billion in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, and is expected to save $6.0 billion in FY 2019 and $7.7billion in FY 2020, the first year of required savings under the plan. DOD officials told GAO that all of the savings reported in DOD's budget materials have been validated against DOD's own systems that record budget information and decisions that are incorporated into DOD's programming and budgeting process. DOD is taking steps to address this challenge and report on its cost baseline to perform all covered activities by January 1, 2020, as required by section 9 21. While DOD has funded some initiatives through its annual budget request process, it continues to face challenges obtaining funding for others. Four initiatives have no costs associated with them or have been funded using existing resources through the regular budget process and DOD does not anticipate any additional costs for the initiatives. Funding needs for the remaining four initiatives have not been fully determined or met, and OCMO has not confirmed that funding has been obtained.
The federal government has long recognized the need to protect itself by ensuring contractors have appropriately allocated costs on cost-based contracts, which include cost-type contracts and certain fixed-price contracts where the contractor's estimated or actual costs play a role in determining the amount the government pays. The total amount obligated annually by the government on these types of contracts is significant. For example, in fiscal year 2018, the federal government obligated approximately $172 billion on such contracts alone, according to GAO's analysis of Federal Procurement Data System information. In 1968, the House Banking and Currency Committee held hearings to determine whether to renew the Defense Production Act of 1950. A witness at the hearings, U.S. Navy Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, testified that defense suppliers could make excessive profits and disguise them as overhead costs or hide them in other ways in the absence of a set of uniform cost accounting standards. Witnesses at the time testified that it was difficult to compare costs among prospective contractors' cost estimates or even to assess costs incurred on contracts with the same contractor without aset of uniform and consistent standards. Congress subsequently directed GAO to study the feasibility of establishing such standards. In August 1970, Congress created the Cost Accounting Standards Board (Board) to promulgate standards designed to achieve uniformity and consistency in cost accounting practices used by federal contractors on defense contracts in excess of $100,000. The Board issued 19 standards that went into effect between 1972 and 1980 for applicable DOD contracts. These standards covered areas such as consistency between how actual and estimated costs are calculated and reported, and ensuring that costs are not double-counted. In fiscal year 1981, Congress stopped funding the Board. However, after a number of disputes arose as to how to interpret various standards, Congress reestablished the Board in 1988. Congress also broadened the Board's authority by applying the standards to all federal contracts--they were previously applicable only to defense contracts. GAO and congressionally established review panels have previously studied the potential impact of CAS on industry as well as possible changes to the Board and the standards. Section 820 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision that GAO report on the effectiveness of the CAS Board in meeting its statutory responsibilities. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Board has complied or is in the process of complying with the administrative and reporting requirements prescribed by Section 820, and (2) the steps the Board is taking to assess how CAS can be conformed with GAO-approved standards. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Board documents and met with Board members, staff, industry representatives, and government agencies. The CAS Board has generally complied with administrative requirements prescribed under Section 820 thus far, including meeting regularly, generally publishing notices and agendas in advance of meetings, and reviewing disputes involving cost accounting-related matters. In response to a statutorily prescribed four-step rulemaking process for promulgating CAS or interpretations, between March and November 2018 the Board discussed the opportunities and methods available for conforming CAS to the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) Standard Accounting and Financial Reporting Act of 1974, where practicable. To do so, the Board held informal discussions with its staff and other stakeholders, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). The Board's initial efforts focus on the extent that two of the 19 standards might be modified or eliminated; however, Board members indicated that these efforts may take several more years to complete. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated where appropriate. DOD had no comments on the report.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded grant programs at educational institutions and requires federal agencies that award grants to educational institutions to ensure that such institutions do not discriminate based on sex. GAO was asked to examine federal agencies' efforts to prevent and address sexual harassment in STEM research. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which selected federal agencies have established and communicated their sexual harassment prevention policies and mechanisms for communicating them to grantees, (2) the number of sexual harassment complaints received from individuals at grantee universities, and (3) the agencies' resources to address these complaints. This statement is based on GAO's preliminary observations from a review of five federal agencies—the Departments of Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice (DOJ), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA-NIFA). GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials from these five agencies about their policies and procedures for communicating with grantees. All five selected agencies provide billions of dollars annually for university research in STEM fields, with NIH providing more than the other four agencies combined. In fiscal year 2017, the five agencies provided a total of about $1.3 billion to universities for STEM research, including $1 billion from NIH, $2 billion from NSF, $3 billion from NASA, $4 billion from DOE, and $5 billion from USDA-NIFI. All of the selected agencies also fund their civil rights and diversity offices separately from their STEM research funding, and there is little relationship between the two budgets. For example, NIH funds its civil rights office through a separate budget, while DOE funds its diversity office through its STEM research budget. All 5 agencies have policies and communication mechanisms in place for grantees to report sexual harassment, but these mechanisms and the content of these policies vary. Based on our preliminary analysis, GAO found that NASA, NIH, and NSF communicate their policies in multiple forms, such as grantee policy manuals, best practices documents, and online FAQs. DOE and USDA provide fewer forms of guidance, either through their website or agency director and Secretary-level policy statements and documents, which focus more generally on the broader category of sex discrimination or provide different levels of information on sexual harassment Prevention Policies for Grantees. The five agencies have updated their definitions of behaviors or actions that qualify as sexual harassment and are in the process of doing so. The definitions are more specific than previous definitions; for example, they include descriptions of gender harassment, the most common form of sexualassment. Also, NSF and NASA have modified, or are taking steps to modify, their grant terms and conditions to strengthen requirements for university grantees that report findings of sexual harassed to the funding agency. Officials from both agencies told us these modifications will help hold grantees accountable for reporting sexual harassment. In addition, two agencies are evaluating the effectiveness of their existing sexual harassment reporting requirements. The selected agencies have taken some steps to promote information sharing and collaboration among agencies on Title IX compliance reviews through the Department of Justice's Title IX STEM working group, which discusses strategies for conducting joint compliance reviews to leverage limited agency resources and share best practices. However, all five agencies reported challenges in obtaining and sharing information about sexual harassment cases. For instance, all 5 agencies told GAO they rarely discuss sexual harassment incidents at the Title IX working group meetings unless they are directly related to an ongoing or planned compliance review or voluntary reporting from universities.
GSA's existing telecommunications contracts are set to expire in May 2023. GSA is in the process of replacing them with EIS, which is to provide agencies with a single source of telecommunications and information technology (IT) services. GAO was asked to review GSA's transition to EIS. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which selected agencies plan to transition their telecommunications services and (2) key factors that contributed to delays, if any, in meeting milestones established by GSA to complete the transition. To address these objectives, GAO selected a nongeneralizable subset of five agencies—Commerce, HHS, NASA, State, VA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)—that exhibited a variety of sizes and structures, and a range of planned and released fair opportunity solicitations for EIS contracts. The selected agencies were also in different stages of their EIS transitions from their current telecommunications contracts. These agencies were the Departments of Commerce (Commerce), Health and Human Services (HHS), NASA (NASA), State (State), and Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials from these agencies. The 19 selected agencies have varied plans for transitioning to Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS). Specifically, 8 of the agencies planned to complete their transitions by the General Services Administration's (GSA) September 30, 2022, milestone, while the 11 remaining agencies did not plan to do so by that date. In addition, agencies varied in the scope and amount of effort that is expected to be required to complete these transitions. For example, 18 of the selected agencies had planned to release between one and six EIS solicitations by March 31, 2019, and 13 planned to issue between 1 and 5 EIS task orders by the same date. The remaining 6 agencies—the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, the Treasury, and VA; and NASA—planned to issue more than 5 task orders. Officials from the 14 agencies that did not release all of their solicitations reported that the complexity of their telecommunications requirements, changes to the agency's contracting strategy, and insufficient staff availability contributed to their delays in releasing these solicitations. Officials also reported that they needed clarification from EIS vendors on the proposals that the agencies received. All five agencies had taken steps to implement the five established transition planning practices, but none had fully implemented any of the practices. Specifically, all five agencies partially implemented the first transition planning practice—to develop an accurate inventory of telecommunications assets and services. However, none of these agencies fully implemented the second and third practices—to identify the resources needed for the transition and to develop a structured transition management approach. All four agencies had partially implemented each of the activities associated with the fourth practice, to identify the level of funding needed to support transition planning. In particular, one agency fully implemented one of the four activities and partially implemented three of the other three activities. The four other agencies had either partially or fully implemented all four activities. Further, all of the six agencies had begun to develop transition plans, but these plans were not complete. Agency officials stated that they had not yet developed complete transition time lines because they were focused on activities related to the acquisition planning phase of the transition, such as developing their electronic information systems solicitations, and they planned to develop complete time lines after they issue their task orders, which are required before the current contracts expire. While agencies' lack of issued task orders may have contributed to the delays in developing complete transition plan, the limited time remaining makes it critical that agencies conduct early planning with the information that is available.
DOD's FMS program is intended to operate on a “no profit, no loss” basis, and the FMS transportation accounts are intended to be used to pay for the costs of goods and services provided to FMS purchasers, such as the Department of Defense (DOD) and U.S. Department of State (State). GAO was asked to review DOD's oversight of the transportation accounts. This report examines (1) the Defense Security Cooperation Agency's (DSCA) oversight of DOD components' activities that affect fees collected into these accounts, and (2) DSCA's financial oversight of expenditures from these accounts. GAO reviewed DOD guidance, analyzed a nongeneralizable, 3-month sample of expenditure data, and interviewed DOD and DFAS officials. DOD guidance to DOD components identifies controls over the information used to calculate the transportation fee collected into the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) transportation accounts, but the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) does not provide routine oversight over DOD components. For example, DOD guidance requires components to review FMS cases at least annually to verify the accuracy of data, but DSC a does not have a routine process to oversee those reviews. Federal internal control standards state that management should establish and implement activities to monitor internal control systems and evaluate results, and ensure that activities are performed routinely and consistently. Without routine oversight of components' annual case reviews--which could include a process to select such reviews for examination, and guidance on how to perform and document examinations--DSCA increases the risk that components may not complete such reviews consistent with its guidance, thereby increasing the likelihood that fees collected may be inaccurate. Additionally, according to DOD, the program is meant to operate in a no-profit, no-loss environment, and inaccuracies in the collection of the F MS transportation fee could lead to over- or under-collecting fees from an FMS purchaser. DSCa officials told GAO that they have begun to work on an initiative to analyze a sample of annual cases on a routine basis, which is expected to be implemented in April 2020. However, until this initiative is fully implemented, the risk remains that components will not complete their reviews in a timely manner, which could result in the inaccurate collection of transportation fees from the incorrect account. Without a documented process to monitor the timeliness of delivery reporting--which is required by DOD regulations to be submitted within 30 days of shipment--DSCA may not be able to provide reasonable assurance that transportation fees are collected from the correct account, and that expenditures paid from the account are allowable and paid for in the correct amount. As part of its monthly review of expenditures to ensure that transportation expenditures are allowable, DSC A reviews expenditures from the transportation account to ensure they are paid for from the proper account, but its internal guidance does not contain procedures for conducting this review. Federal Internal Control Standards state that managers should design control activities to respond to risks, implement activities that address those controls, and identify the information requirements needed to achieve objectives. Without internal guidance identifying the data needed to oversee expenditures or explaining how they should evaluate expenditure data for and address discrepancies, DOD cannot ensure that expenditures are reviewed for allowable and proper payments from the appropriate account. As a result, DOD is at risk of paying transportation costs from the wrong account.
HHS, USDA, and EPA are among the federal agencies that conduct research that uses animals to assess the safety and efficacy of products for human health and the environment. GAO was asked to review the use of animals in research. This report examines (1) how HHS, USDA and EPA ensure that researchers consider alternatives to animal research and (2) the extent to which the agencies have facilitated the development and use of alternative research methods through individual and collaborative efforts. GA O reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents; interviewed agency officials; and reviewed documents from a nongeneralizable sample of 12 research facilities selected based on the number of animals used for research. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have used a variety of methods to ensure researchers consider alternative methods for animal research, such as requiring researchers to describe and document their consideration of alternatives and providing training to researchers and animal care and use committees to help ensure researchers have considered alternatives. For example, HHS's National Institutes of Health (NIH) and USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) require research facilities to consider alternatives through the agencies' implementation of the Animal Welfare Act and the Health Research Extension Act, respectively. EPA research is covered by the two laws to the extent that it uses animals covered by these laws. The steps HHS and USDA take to ensure that agency researchers and the researchers that they fund or oversee meet the requirement that they consider alternatives include calling for written descriptions of researchers' consideration and prescribing or recommending that researchers use searches to identify alternatives. In addition, NIH's Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare provides training to research facilities and conducts site visits at selected facilities to ensure compliance with the act's requirements. The agencies also have engaged in multiple efforts to expand the range of available alternatives, including establishing the Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (ICCVAM). ICCVAM's strategic roadmap calls for its members to identify appropriate metrics for prioritizing activities, monitoring progress, and measuring success toward the goals described in the roadmap. However, ICCV AM and its member agencies have not routinely developed metrics that they could report to the public to demonstrate how their individual or collective efforts have affected or will affect animal use. By establishing or designating a workgroup to develop metrics that the agencies could use to assess their progress toward reducing, refining, or replacing animal use in testing and by incorporating those metrics in ICCVam's biennial progress reports, the committee and its members could better monitor progress and report the members' progress.
The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for ensuring the safety of the nations commercial vessels, including ensuring that they comply with the International Safety Management (ISM) Codean international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code establishes safety management objectives, such as preventing human injury or loss of life, and identifies a framework of key elements required to be considered for inclusion in an SMS. Vessel operators are required to develop, implement, and maintain an SMS that is to include functional requirements such as procedures to prepare for and respond to emergency situations. The Coast Guard has authorized certain organizations to perform SMS audits and certifications on its behalf. GAO was asked to review SMS compliance and oversight. This report examines (1) how the Coast Guard verifies SMS compliance, (2) the extent to which SMS plans address potential shipboard emergencies identified in Coast Guard guidance, and (3) Coast Guard efforts to enhance its oversight of SMS-related activities. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed Coast Guard officials; and reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 SMS plans (or excerpts) developed by vessel operators that GAO selected based on factors such as size, type of vessel, and location; and interviewed officials from Coast Guard and recognized organizations that perform SMS audit and certification services on behalf of Coast Guard. The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard) verifies vessel safety management systems (SMS) compliance as part of its overall vessel compliance activities, including annual vessel inspections. These inspections are intended to verify the effectiveness of the vessels SMS, even if SMS oversight is not the primary purpose of the inspection. The agencyS annual vessel inspection program includes a five-step process to identify any deficiencies, determine if there are clear grounds for an expanded vessel inspection, and specify any applicable compliance options. For example, if inspectors identify serious deficiencies that could indicate broader SMS failures (such as an absence of required equipment or failure by the company to notify the Coast Coast Guard of reportable marine casualties and hazards), the inspectors record the deficiency and require an internal SMS audit. If during the course of a vessel inspection Coast Guard inspectors observe more serious deficiencies or failures such as defective or missing fire-fighting or life-saving equipment, the vessel is detained and an external audit is to be performed by the operator prior to the vessel being released from detention. In addition to conducting annual inspections, the Coast guard also conducts additional SMS oversight of vessels designated as higher-risk vessels for additional oversight and more frequent inspections. In 2018, in response to recommendations made in the investigative reports of the 2017 sinking of the freighter El Faro (EL FARO) and the 2018 grounding of another vessel (both of which were related to SMS), Coast Guard took steps to improve its management of the Alternate Compliance Program, including efforts to improve data reporting. In March 2018, Coast Guard revised its form for documenting deficiencies during vessel inspections to include a checkbox to indicate if a deficiency is related to an SMS, which will allow for enhanced annual reporting of safety-related deficiencies identified during compliance activities. According to Coast Guard headquarters officials, the agency plans to review and assess the SMS deficiency data to provide feedback to inspectors, vessel operators, and ROs. The officials also stated that SMS deficiencies will be included in future risk-based vessel inspection programs, including the fleet risk index discussed earlier. In response to EL FARO investigative report recommendations, in 2018 Coast Guard initiated several initiatives to enhance oversight of the organizations that provide SMS services and certifies for the agency. These efforts were largely driven by actions identified by the Commandant in December 2017. In particular, the Guard established a new group to monitor the global performance of the fleet, increased direct observations of ROs, developed key performance indicators, and developed guidance to request internal investigations for certain RO deficiencies. It is too early for GAO to assess the overall effectiveness of these efforts; however, they are positive steps toward enhancing oversight. Each of the 12 SMS plan excerpts GAO examined identify potential ship board emergencies and applicable response procedures, but they do not address the full range of emergency scenarios included in the guidance. The most frequently addressed shipboard emergency scenarios are Fire, Collision, Grounding, Abandoned Ship, and Man Overboard. While none of the SMS plans reviewed specifically address all 21 potential emergency shipboard scenarios identified in the 2018 guidance, the
The Secret Service's primary responsibility is to physically protect the President, Vice President, their immediate families, and visiting foreign dignitaries as well as the White House complex. In 2014, the PMP recommended that the Secret Service align its operations with its priorities, and chief among these is protection. GAO was asked to review the agency's progress in implementing the recommendations. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which the agency has (1) implemented the recommendations and (2) communicated agency priorities and increased time spent on protection agencywide. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and data and interviewed Secret Service officials. The U.S. Secret Service has made progress implementing the Protective Mission Panel's recommendations, but recommended training targets have not been achieved. The Secret Service fully implemented 11 recommendations and is in the process of implementing the remaining eight recommendations. For example, in 2015, the agency created a platform on its intranet known as Spark! that allows all employees to share ideas and submit suggestions on how to improve agency performance and efficiency. The platform allows two-way communication between leadership and the workforce. In 2017, 96 percent of employees contributed to a discussion on the site. The agency also reported that, as of June 2018, 51 workforce-generated ideas had been implemented or were being implemented. In addition, in 2017, the Secret service began offering a training course on workplace communication called “Enhancing Workplace Communication” and plans to introduce additional leadership courses for personnel at all levels. However, in fiscal year 2018, Secret Service special agents assigned to the Presidential and Vice Presidential Protective Divisions (PPD and VPD) missed their annual training targets by about 76 and 88 percent, respectively, and the agency does not have a plan specifically for meeting training targets for these two divisions given current and planned staffing levels. In May 2019, after reviewing a draft of this report and after further consideration of the resources required to achieve the training targets, in May 2019 the agency stated that it no longer agrees with the training target recommended by the Panel. Developing and implementing a plan for meeting established training targets will help ensure that protection-related training targets are met in the near term and that agents are prepared to carry out Secret Service’s priority—protection. The PMP also recommended that Secret Service Uniformed Division officers train for 10 percent of their work time, but the agency lacks complete and appropriate training data for these officers. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, and management should implement control activities through policies. Internal control standards also state that managers should use quality information to achieve an entity's objective. According to Secret Service, training data are collected through various means and systems, such as using a database called ePerson to capture certain types of training, and officials report that they separately use DHS's Performance and Learning Management System, which DHS designed to consolidate existing learning management systems for each of DHS's agencies. The system collects data on computer-based training and training provided at the James J. Rowley Training Center automatically, but requires manual entry for training provided on-the-job at offsite locations. Secret service officials stated that there are a significant amount of internal training instances that do not get recorded. Without a policy with a documented process for collecting complete training data, it will be difficult for the agency to assess and make informed decisions about whether and how training needs and the 10-percent training target are being met.
In fiscal year 2019, VHA allocated $23 billion in general purpose and specific purpose funds to its 18 VISNs and medical centers to provide health care services to veterans and other beneficiaries. VA's strategic plan calls for the efficient use of funds for delivering health care to veterans. GAO was asked to review VHA's allocation of funds. This report examines (1) how VHA allocates funds to medical centers, (2) the mechanisms VHA uses to monitor the use of allocated funds, and (3) the extent to which VHA monitors the redistributions of funds across the VA health care system. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed VHA documents and interviewed officials from VHA and VISNs, as well as officials from four VHA program offices that managed the largest amounts of funds in fiscal year2019. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) allocates general purpose funds for veterans' health care through its 18 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) based on a formula that considers the number and type of veterans served and the complexity of care provided, among other factors, to determine the amount of funds each VISN should receive. VHA then allocates these funds to each medical center within the VISN based on the medical center's patient workload, which is based on factors such as patient volume, case mix, and specialized services. Once funds are allocated and distributed to VISNs or medical centers by the beginning of each fiscal year, these funds may be redistributed in accordance with law to address unfunded needs or surpluses that may arise. For example, according to officials, a medical center may need additional funds to provide care for veterans when natural disasters occur. However, VA does not require VISNs to provide information on how they determine how much and for what reasons they make adjustments to medical center allocation levels. As a result, VA cannot reasonably ensure that these adjustments are justified and align with its strategic plan. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities to achieve agency objectives. Such an activity could include having guidance on the allocation and adjustment of funds that promotes the efficiency of funds used to deliver health care. Without requiring VISNs--in conjunction with medical centers--to develop and submit an approach to change how medical centers with decreasing workload should operate, VA increases the risk that the adjustments will not align with the strategic plan and may lead to inefficiencies. Once the funds have been allocated to the medical centers and the VISNs have received their allocations, VA uses multiple mechanisms to ensure that the funds are used within their allocated funding levels and are in compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act. These mechanisms include VA's financial management system to track obligations and prevent VISNs from obligating amounts that are greater than the funds they have available. VA also employs additional mechanisms, such as comparing VISNs' planned obligations with actual obligations on a monthly basis and requiring VISN explanations for any variances of 5 percent or more above or below the amount between planned obligations in their operating plans and actual obligations. VA has opportunities to strengthen its processes for allocating and monitoring funds distributed across its health care systems to ensure they are used efficiently and consistent with department goals.
In school year 2016-17, there were about 6.8 million IDEA students aged 3 to 21 who were served under IDEA Part B, which provides for the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of children with disabilities, or the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the child. IDEA requires states to make dispute resolution options available to parents to resolve disagreements regarding a school district's decisions related to IDEA-related issues. GAO was asked to review the use of dispute resolution in IDEA. In this report, GAO examines (1) how often IDEA dispute options are used, and whether use in selected states varies across school district-level socioeconomic or demographic characteristics; and (2) what challenges parents face in using these options and how Education and selected states help facilitate parents' use of these options. To address these objectives, we collected and analyzed data from five states—Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania—based on a combination of criteria, including the amount of dispute activity within the state and the states' ability to provide reliable LEA level data on disputes. We also interviewed officials from Education and state educational agencies (SEA) in these five states and other stakeholders, including national organizations that advocate for parents and local educational agencies and SEAs. For the students served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Dispute Resolution Options were used about 35,000 times nationwide and varied across school districts with different characteristics. Due process complaints were the most commonly used dispute resolution option, and disputes were most frequently related to evaluations, placement, services and supports, and discipline. Mediation was the least commonly used option, with state complaints being the least frequently used option. In general, a greater proportion of very high-income districts had dispute resolution activity, and these districts also had higher rates of such activity. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified several types of challenges parents may face, such as the cost of attorneys for due process hearings and the lack of access to expert witnesses, as well as other factors that may affect parents' willingness and ability to initiate dispute resolution. Education and states' education and state efforts are designed to help parents who may face these challenges. Education's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) administers IDEA, and is responsible for data collection and monitoring, among other responsibilities. Specifically, SEAs are required to annually report to OSEP data on the total number of: mediation requests received, mediation agreements reached, due process complaints filed, resolution meetings that result in a written settlement agreement, and due process Hearings conducted. Each state also reports data on timely resolution of state complaints and timely adjudication of due process Complaints. In addition, Education provides technical assistance to states and parents through its Parent Training and Information Centers (PTI), Community Parent Resource Centers (CPRC), and Protection and Advocacy (P&A) agencies. In some cases, P&A agencies provide legal services to parents at no cost, or refer clients to other attorneys. Further, a court may award parents reasonable attorney's fees and costs if they prevail in a due process hearing; however, parents cannot recoup expert witness costs regardless of the outcome. Also, if parents do not prevail at a hearing, they may be responsible for the district's legal costs in addition to their own, which can be a disincentive to going through a hearing. State officials GAO contacted said their states offer telephone helplines that parents can call with questions about their dispute options and the processes involved, and some states provide training and technical assistance.
Since 1990, GAO's High-Risk List has identified 62 different program areas that are high risk due to their vulnerability to mismanagement or that are most in need of transformation. Since 1990, 26 areas have been removed from the list, and 2 have been consolidated. The list is intended to help inform the congressional oversight agenda and to improve government performance. GAO was asked to testify on the status of Indian Affairs, BIE, BIA, IHS, and BIA's efforts to address the management weaknesses that led to the high-risk designation. This testimony is based on GAO reports issued from September 2013 through March 2019 on these agencies' progress in addressing GAO recommendations related to Indian education, energy, health care, and health care programs that were made in response to recommendations GAO made in November 2016 and September 2017. The Department of the Interior's (Interior) Indian Affairs (IA), Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and Indian Health Service (IHS) have made some progress in improving the management of programs that serve tribes and their members since GAO last reported on them in September 2017, but additional progress is needed to fully address the criteria and related management weaknesses. For example, Indian Affairs has addressed 11 of the 23 outstanding education recommendations, including a strategic plan and two school safety recommendations. BIA has also made progress in energy, but has not yet completed action plans on other recommendations. IHS has taken some steps to improve its health care program, such as developing a new Office of Quality and a patient experience of care survey. However, it still does not have a comprehensive action plan to identify the root causes of its management weaknesses and address the problems. Indian Affairs and IHS continue to face challenges, particularly in retaining permanent leadership and a sufficient workforce, to fully meet the criteria for removal from the high risk list. The five criteria for removing high- risk designations are (1) leadership commitment, (2) capacity, (3) action plan, (4) monitoring, (5) demonstrated progress, and (6) demonstrating progress. The agencies have partially met each of these criteria for the three areas GAO identified in its March 2019 report (see table below). For example: Education. BIE has taken actions to partially meet the leadership commitment criterion, including hiring a full-time program analyst to coordinate its working group and help oversee the implementation of recommendations on Indian education. IIA has made progress on the capacity criterion, but needs to demonstrate that it has the capacity (i.e., people and other resources) to resolve management weaknesses, including developing a plan to assess tradeoffs between people and resources needed to address management weaknesses in Indian education and energy. Health Care. IH has made some efforts to improve the management and oversight of health care. For instance, IH developed an online tool that enables the agency to track providers that do not accept IHS's payment rates for nonhospital care. I HS has also implemented four of the 13 open health care recommendations, and plans to complete implementation of additional recommendations in 2019. Energy. The agency has made significant progress in developing data collection instruments and processes needed to track and review response times for a number of different actions associated with energy development. For the energy area, the agency has taken steps to enhance its geographic information system capabilities to ensure it can verify ownership in a timely manner and has completed efforts to modify its database for oil and gas leases and agreements, among other actions. IHA has also developed a long-term capital asset plan to inform its allocation of school facility funds, which GAO recommended in May 2017. For energy, IIA recently created a recently created Indian Energy Service Center, which is responsible for developing and managing Indian energy resources, and has drafted a workforce plan to help identify critical skills and competencies related to energy development and identify potential gaps.
In March 2017, State began a reform effort that led to 17 reform projects, most of which are unimplemented but still continuing. State notified the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress of these projects in its fiscal year 2019 Congressional Budget Justification. GAO was asked to review State's reform efforts. This report examines (1) the status of the reform efforts that State reported to Congress and (2) the extent to which State addressed key practices GAO previously identified as critical to the successful implementation of agency reforms. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed senior officials responsible for the reform projects identified in State's fiscal year 2018 budget justification, as well as those responsible for each of the continuing reform projects. As of April 2019, according to State officials and status reports, State had completed one of its 17 ongoing reform projects; 13 projects were continuing; two projects were stalled pending future decisions or actions; and one project was discontinued. The Department of State's (State) Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Offices of the Deputy Secretary of State and Inspector General were also reviewing State's overall reform efforts, but GAO's review was limited to the implementation phase of these efforts—from April 2018 to the present—to avoid duplicating the reviews of earlier phases of these reform efforts conducted by State's and USAID's OIG. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) did not provide written comments on the report. In addition, USAID expressed several concerns about State's leadership of its reform efforts and State's coordination with USAID. In response to the March 2017 Executive Order 13781 and the ensuing OMB memo, State launched a “listening tour” intended to gather ideas and feedback from State employees. As a key component of this outreach effort, State hired a contractor to design and administer a confidential online survey, which was sent to all State andUSAID employees in May 2017. According to the contractor's report, the survey had a 43 percent response rate, with 27,837 State employees and 6,142 USAID employees responding to the survey. The contractor also conducted in-person interviews with a randomly selected cross section of personnel, which included 175 employees from State and 94 from USAID, and highlighted five areas for State reforms. In July 2017, the DeputySecretary of State created five planning teams to develop multiple projects in those five areas. The Deputy Secretary also established an Executive Steering Committee composed of senior State officials to guide the planning teams and provide direction during the reform process. The planning teams were tasked with gathering information and conducting analysis in five areas: Foreign Assistance Programs: Analyze current foreign assistance programs to develop a future vision, ensuring alignment with national priorities. Overseas Alignment and Approach: Assess key diplomatic activities and identify required platforms, including the balance of work between headquarters and the field. Human Capital Planning: Identifying ways to promote an agile and empowered workforce as part of an overarching talent map. Management Support: Identify opportunities to streamline administrative support functions at the bureau and agency levels to ensure front line effectiveness. Information Technology (IT) Platform Planning: Focus on improving the employee experience through increased use of cutting-edge technology and streamlining duplicative systems and processes.
Intimate partner violence affects over 30 percent of women and men in the United States, and research has raised concerns about brain injuries sustained by these domestic violence victims. GAO was asked to review issues related to brain injuries resulting from intimate partner violence. This report examines (1) what is known about the prevalence of brain injuries that result from domestic violence and (2) the role of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in addressing these issues. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed officials from HHS and DOJ, as well as other federal and non-federal stakeholders. Data on the overall prevalence of Brain Injuries Resulting from Intimate Partner Violence is limited; improved data could help target HHS public health efforts to address this issue. Specifically, available data do not provide an overall estimate of the extent to which individuals suffer brain injuries as a result of domestic violence. While there are studies that estimate prevalence, these studies are limited and do not include an objective to estimate prevalence. For example, of the 28 articles GAO examined, six included an objective for estimating prevalence, while the remaining 22 articles examined other areas, such as health effects or awareness of these injuries. As a result, the range of reported prevalence rates varied greatly (from 11 percent to about 79 percent) and were based on a range of sample sizes, from 95 people to about 1,000 people. HHS agencies also have some data collection and research efforts related to this issue; however, these efforts are limited as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have efforts that may assist in better understanding the connection between brain injuries and domestic violence, but CDC's efforts do not account for all causes of brain injury and NIH has only one study focused on this connection. Further, HHS agencies treat these issues as separate public health issues and pursue their efforts separately--which limits their ability to better understand the connection. By working together, HHS and its agencies can identify ways that each agency's efforts could result in better prevalence data and a better overall understanding of these issues, which could help them better target their efforts and allocate resources, including grant funding, to address the issue. In addition to HHS agencies, nonfederal entities have also undertaken efforts to provide education, screen for, or treat individuals with brain injury resulting from domestic partner violence, including those that may result from strangulation, which is often also experienced by victims of intimate partner Violence. For instance, one initiative developed training materials for emergency medical personnel, law enforcement, prosecutors, and providers and hosted trainings throughout Connecticut on intimate partnerviolence and brain injuries, according to officials with the Safe Futures initiative, which developed strangulation training materials.
From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received over 8.9 million disability compensation claims from veterans and awarded over $20.2 billion in benefits, according to VA data. GAO was asked to review issues related to veterans who have been removed from the United States. This report examines (1) the extent to which the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) adhered to its policies for handling cases of potentially removable veterans and (2) the number of noncitizen service members applying for naturalization and USCIS's efforts to facilitate the naturalization of these service members. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and procedures and interviewed officials from ICE, VA, DOD, and the Departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Veterans Affairs, and State. ICE has developed policies that govern the handling of cases involving potentially removable military veterans, but does not consistently adhere to those policies. For example, ICE does not have a policy requiring agents and officers to identify and document veteran status when interviewing potentially removable individuals. As a result, some veterans who were removed may not have received the level of review and approval that ICE has determined is appropriate for cases involving veterans. Without developing and implementing a new policy or revising its current policies, ICE has no way of knowing whether it has identified all of the veterans it has encountered and, therefore, has no reasonable assurance that it is consistently implementing its policies and procedures for handling veterans' cases. Further, without collecting and maintaining complete electronic data on veterans it encounters, ICE cannot determine the extent of its compliance with its policies. Based on the limited information available in the Office of Legal Assistance's (OPLA) database, approximately 250 veterans were placed in removal proceedings or removed fromthe United States from fiscal years2013 through 2018. Of these veterans, 115 had been ordered removed, 25 had been granted relief or protection from removal by an immigration judge, and about 5 had their cases closed administratively. The remainder of the cases were still open as of November 2018. In addition, 92 of the approximately 250 military veterans had been removed, of which 90 were foreign nationals with one or more criminal convictions. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (USCIS) and Department of Defense (DOD) have policies that facilitate naturalization for service members and veterans, and both agencies provide informational resources to service members seeking naturalization. USCIS facilitates the application and naturalization process for current and recently discharged members of the Armed Forces through a dedicated Military Naturalization Unit, which processes military naturalization applications and assists field officers with administrative naturalization tasks overseas, among other things. To provide information, USCIS maintains a toll-free “Military Help Line” and an e-mail box exclusively for military members and their families and publishes an “Immigration 101” presentation for relevant stakeholders, including DOD personnel on military bases. DOD determines whether a service member meets the qualifying service requirement by certifying whether the service member has served “honorably,” such as in the Army, and if he or she has separated from service, whether his or her separation was under honorable conditions. In order to naturalize, a member must also meet the requirements and statutory qualifications to become a citizen, such as demonstrating good moral character and having sufficient knowledge of the English language, U. S. government, and history. However, in October 2017, DOD changed its policy to increase the amount of time noncitizens must serve before DOD will certify their honorable service for naturalized purposes. USCUS's processing time for military naturalizations also increased, from an average of 5.4 months in fiscal year 2017 to 12.5 months in 2018. USCis officials attributed this increase to the backlog in DOD background checks for MAVNI recruits, as well as an increased volume of naturalization applicants from non-military applicants. Although being removed for violation of immigration law does not in and of itself affect eligibility for VA benefits and services, living abroad affects eligibility for certain benefits and Services. Specifically, veterans living abroad may face additional obstacles in receiving certain benefits for which they are otherwise eligible because they may be barred from traveling to theUnited States. For instance, a removed veteran may not be able to attend a hearing to appeal a VA disability rating decision because VA conducts those hearings exclusively in the United states. Additionally, a veteran may face challenges accessing certain Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment services if the
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) requires that the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and insurers share in losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism with insured losses above the program trigger of $200 million and below the program cap of $100 billion. Under TRIA, the federal government is required to recoup at least some of these losses. GAO was asked to review TRIA. This report (1) examines the changes in explicit fiscal exposure under TRIA and how insurers have adjusted to the changes; and (2) describes situations in which implicit fiscal exposures may arise and might become explicit. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and reports; analyzed Treasury data; and interviewed Treasury, industry stakeholders, and a nongeneralizable sample of five insurers selected because they provide terrorism coverage to businesses and reflect a mix of sizes and types of insurance. Since 2003, changes to TRIA provisions have increased insurers' share of losses and thus decreased explicit federal fiscal exposure in the event of certified acts of terrorism, but Treasury and some insurers have different interpretations of key definitions of key terms. For example, some insurers may not clearly understand whether Treasury would include policyholder retention amounts in calculating losses to certify a terrorist event, trigger loss sharing, or determine when the cap has been reached. Treasury uses different methods to communicate program information and clarify program details to stakeholders, such as program regulations and interpretive letters, but has not clarified this issue using these or other methods because officials believe the distinction is understood in the industry. Federal internal control standards state that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information so that external parties can help the entity achieve its objectives and address related risks. By closing the information gap of how it would calculate losses for the program threshold, trigger, and cap, Treasury would create a common understanding of a critical feature of the program. Furthermore, Treasury may prevent uncertainty in the insurance market and potential litigation following an event that could delay insurance payments and economic recovery. Implicit fiscal exposure exists and in some situations could become Explicit. TRIA explicitly limits federal exposure following a terrorist act, but in certain circumstances under mandatory and discretionary recoupment, the government could be expected to provide assistance beyond what is explicitly outlined in TRIA to policyholders and insurers. Under certain circumstances, including potential effects on market stability, public expectation may lead the government to cancel or reduce the amount of funds recouped. Any portion of the federal coshare not recouped represents an implicit fiscal exposure. Although the government may not act on these expectations, to the extent that it does, the implicit exposure would become an explicit exposure. Insurers adjusted to program changes, but some were unclear about how Treasury would calculate the program certification thresholds, trigger and cap. As the share of insured losses for which insurers are responsible has increased, the ability of insurers to absorb the extra exposure also has increased. Some insurers used risk-mitigation strategies to reduce or offset their exposures, including purchasing reinsurance—insurance for insurers—to cover their deductibles, or diversifying their portfolios (for instance, reducing concentrations of risk in certain locations or lines of insurance). Insurers told GAO that they considered the potential effect of program changes in each reauthorization and modified their strategies, as needed. Other industry stakeholders said that because program changes have been gradual and expected, insurance companies have been able to adjust their coverage accordingly.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched 29 years ago. JWST is being designed for a 5-year mission to search for the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe, study planets in other solar systems, and trace the evolution of galaxies from their beginning to their current formation. The project has a history of significant cost growth and schedule delays, which resulted in a replan in September 2011 and a rebaseline in June 2018. In March 2019, GAO found that NASA had considered many of the program's risks while developing its 2018 replan schedule and cost baseline but recommended that additional analysis be completed to provide NASA and Congress with better insight into project resourcing and affordability. GAO was asked to update its March 2019 report. This report examines, among other things, (1) the status of NASA's efforts since 2018 to improve the project's oversight and ensure quality and (2) the extent to which the program has identified new technical issues that have contributed to the use of schedule reserve since the replan. To conduct this work, in March 2019 GAO reviewed NASA documents and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. Since GAO's last report in March 2018, NASA has made significant progress in improving oversight and involvement with Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor on the JWst project, and has made additional oversight changes to further enhance communication with and oversight of the contractor. NASA has implemented all 32 recommendations made by the Independent Review Board (IRB) in its final report in May 2018 and has sustained oversight improvements that were started prior to that report. For example, the IRB made 32 recommendations covering a range of topics from improving communication with stakeholders to identifying embedded problems. NASA implemented its recommendation to establish March 2021 as the committed launch date for the project through the June 2018 Replan. NASA also sustained, and in some cases expanded, the oversight initiatives that were begun prior to the 2018 report. The cost plus award fee contract provides the project with a means to incentivize contractor performance related to cost, schedule, technical, and business management goals. Since the 2018 replans, the project has achieved a number of integration and testing milestones and has taken steps to address previously identified technical challenges. The program has completed testing on the individual component elements of the observatory and has integrated them to start observatory level testing, the last of five phases of Integration and testing. Further, the program completed the last major testing milestone for optical telescope and science instrumentation elements—deployment of the secondary mirror assembly—in August 2019. This secondary mirror focuses the light collected by the 18 hexagonal primary mirrors of JW ST into a beam and directs it toward scientific equipment aboard the observatories. NASA continues to use schedule reserve to address the technical challenges identified in the replans but has less than a quarter of the schedule reserve allotted to the project. The technical challenges have resulted in prolonged employment of the contractors' workforce, which is the primary driver for increased costs. According to NASA officials, the contractor has found ways to replenish reserve, but NASA is still reviewing some of these methods and the project continues to work through significant integration and test events with little margin for error.
FAA's vision for integrating UAS into the national airspace system entails UAS operating safely and routinely—i.e., without requiring prior approval for UAS flights—in the same airspace as manned aircraft. While safety is FAA's paramount concern, the integration of UAS is important because of the potential economic benefits that progress in UAS integration could bring, including more investment in uses such as large passenger operations, as well as the potential safety benefits, such as more effective firefighting and other disaster response efforts. GAO was asked to review FAA's efforts to integrate UAS. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which FAA's test sites have facilitated UAS flight testing and (2) how FAA is sharing information with the public about how the test site program informs the agency's integration efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FAA documents and interviewed FAA officials, test site representatives, and UAS stakeholders. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) designated UAS test sites provide significant benefits to the UAS industry, offering their users a variety of services with minimal operating investment from FAA. According to FAA, the test sites facilitated about 15,000 test flights occurring under test site authorizations (COAs) from April 2015 through December 2018. Test site representatives told GAO that they have supported over 440 public and private users to conduct research and development on UAS to be used for a wide range of activities, from inspecting utilities to carrying passengers. For example, users have conducted research on the safety risks and tested UAS capabilities such as the ability to carry loads of varying weights at the sites, which align with some of the key capabilities identified by FAA as necessary for the upcoming phases of integration. Test sites have also participated in federal research projects intended to inform FAA's integration plans, including the Department of Transportation's UAS Integration Pilot Program, which is intended to evaluate different concepts for certain UAS operations in specific communities. FAA has taken some steps to address management and collaboration challenges as the program has matured, but GAO's review of test site reports and interviews with test site users and representatives found that some previously identified challenges persist. Specifically, FAA has improved its management of the program by providing additional guidance, streamlining the COA process for test sites, and improving its collaboration with and management of test sites. However, according to representatives and users GAO interviewed, FAA's guidance on priority research still lacks the needed detail about research areas to prioritize in order to promote overall integration efforts, and the agency has not provided more information about how and when it plans to integrate large UAS, which would allow for more complex operations. FAA regularly gathers information and data from test sites but has not fully leveraged the data or the program to advance UASintegration. FAA officials said that they are considering creating a plan for analyzing test site data, but have not yet done so. Without such a plan, FAA could miss opportunities to better use the data to inform the overall integration effort. FAA provides limited information to the public, including stakeholders and test sites users, about how research being conducted at test sites helps to inform its integration efforts and how the program relates to FAA's plans. For instance, FAA officials point to two main public efforts related to the program: FAA's 2018 U AS Integration Roadmap, which provides a high-level overview of how test sites inform its plans for integration, and its UAS Test Sites Fact Book, which includes a section on current test site research with examples that, if shared, could help increase stakeholders' understanding of how FAA could use such research to inform decisions. Without more accessible information, some stakeholders may not be aware of their options for pursuing research through a test site, thus potentially limiting the usefulness of the testsite program.
Since 2015, Congress has provided at least $2 billion annually for U.S. democracy assistance in four selected countries—the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Ukraine. State and USAID, as well as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), have roles in providing democracy assistance. GAO was asked to review the extent to which these agencies coordinate their democracy assistance efforts. This report examines (1) State's, USAID's, and NED's allocations of funding for democracy assistance for fiscal years 2015 through 2018, (2) their roles and the extent that projects in selected countries during this period were consistent with these roles, and (3) their coordination efforts. To do this work, GAO analyzed State, NED, and global democracy assistance data, reviewed agency documents, and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C., and in the four countries. The Department of State (State) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated a total of more than $8.8 billion in democracy assistance to a combined total of 100 countries in fiscal years2015 through 2018. State allocated 33 percent of this amount—a total of $2.9 billion, averaging approximately $727 million annually—to its Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and other bureaus to provide democracy assistance, while USAID allocated the remaining 67 percent—$5.9 million annually. State's DRL, INL, and the Bureau's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (BHD) directed democracy assistance allocations to many of the same countries, although the program areas they supported varied. For example, DRL focused a greater percentage of its funding in countries where citizens enjoy fewer democratic freedoms, such as those rated as “not free” by Freedom House’s 2018 “Freedom in the World” survey. USAID directed about half of its democracy assistance funding to countries rated as not free in this survey. In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, D RL and INL directed the largest percentages of their allocations to encouraging human rights and promoting the rule of law, respectively. In addition, in the selected countries, State's Bureau of Human Rights and Labor and the Department of the United Kingdom's Department of Foreign and International Development have strategies that define their roles in democracy aid, and their funding obligations in these countries generally aligned with their respective roles. In all four countries GAO selected for review—the DRC, Nigeria; Tunisia; Ukraine; and Ukraine—for this review, the U.N. Educational, Scientific, Cultural, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reported that in fiscal year 2017, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECO) estimated that State's BHD obligated about $1.2 billion for democracy aid in the DRC and Nigeria, about $0.7 billion in Tunisia, and about $3.5 billion in Ukraine for fiscal year 2018. In these countries, the UNECO estimated that the majority of these obligations supported human rights, civil society, and independent media and the free flow of information, among other areas. In contrast, in Ukraine and Tunisia, State obligated less than one-tenth of one-third of its obligations in each of these areas. The United States provides democracy assistance primarily through overseas missions to support country development, according to the 2013 USAID Strategy on Democracy and Human Rights. The strategy explains that support for democracy is essential to achieving the agency's broader social and economic development goals, which, the agency has noted, contribute to self-reliance. To support democracy from a development perspective, the strategy states that USAID generally funds multiyear, multimillion-dollar democracy assistance projects that are implemented by international organizations. In each of the four selected nations, USAid's democracy assistance objectives generally align with its defined role to support democratic change in order to achieve broader development goals. For instance, the USAID country development cooperation strategy for each country articulated objectives to support the country's overall development. In Tunisia, for example, the 2016 USAID strategy for Tunisia included a development objective to promote social cohesion through democratic consolidation. In Ukraine, the 2018 strategy for Ukraine included an objective to strengthen the capacity of civil society groups, promote reconciliation, and foster the development of new media. Although DRL takes steps
The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and the Defense Logistics Agency ( DLA) are responsible for managing the Defense-Wide Working Capital Fund (DWWCF) and providing goods and services to the military departments and services. The military departments are the largest customers of these agencies' services, spending about $36.3 billion in fiscal year 2018. GAO was asked to review the management of the DWWCF. This report examines (1) the extent to which DFAS, DISA, and DLA have applied the key operating principles for working capital fund self-sufficiency and (2) the steps the three agencies have taken to establish an equitable pricing methodology. To do this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials from the three defense agencies. The three Defense-wide working capital funds have applied two of the three components of the key principles for effective management of working capital Funds—establishing a transparent and equitable pricing methodologies and ensuring that costs are allocated equitably—by setting rates that are designed to cover actual costs and establishing a management review for rate setting. However, despite taking steps intended to allocate costs equitably among their customers, the three DOD agencies have not fully applied the third component of the operating principle by establishing pricing methods that are transparent to their customers. For example, DFAS and DISA do not provide customers with detailed information on the types of costs included in their rates and how those costs are calculated and allocated to customers. In addition, DLA does not provide sufficient pricing transparency despite the rate briefings it conducts for its customers. By providing more complete and transparent information on methodologies used to calculate rates, the costs used in those calculations, and how changes in workload affect a customer's rates, these agencies could improve their communication with their customers and allow their customers to better understand and make decisions to help them manage the costs of the services that they obtain. DOD also has applied all of the components of all three of the remaining operating principles. These principles relate to delineating roles and responsibilities, measuring performance, and assessing resource requirements and customer needs. By implementing these principles, the agencies are better positioned to: Promote a clear understanding of who will be held accountable for specific tasks or duties, reduce the risk of mismanaged funds and tasks or functions “falling through the cracks,” and educate customers about whom to contact if they have questions. Measure their operational performance, assess their performance against strategic goals, and identify opportunities to improve performance. Enable customers to provide input or voice concerns about their needs, enable agencies to prioritize customer demand and use resources most effectively. Build in flexibility to obtain customer input and meet customer needs by communicating with customers regularly and in a timely manner and developing processes to assess resource needs.
Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest public health threats facing the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC has reported that antibiotic-resistant infections have caused an estimated 15,000 deaths a year in the U.S. in recent years. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to combat antibiotic resistance. This report examines: (1) CDC's efforts to address surveillance of antibiotic resistance and any challenges to these efforts; (2) CDC efforts to advance the development and use of diagnostic tests for identification and characterization of resistant bacteria and to address barriers to the development of such tests; (3) challenges to developing new treatments for antibiotic- resistant infections and federal efforts in addressing these challenges; and (4) federal efforts for promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics and any remaining challenges. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials from CDC, other federal agencies, experts, and stakeholder organizations, and representatives from a nongeneralizable selection of six diagnostic test manufacturers and 11 randomly selected companies that conduct research and development on new antibiotics for bacterial infections. CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Biomedical Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. CDC has taken a number of actions since 2015 to address antibiotic resistance, such as issuing a National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (National Action Plan). However, CDC faces three general challenges in tracking and reporting trends in antibiotic resistance that limit the agency's ability to identify important new resistances or trends. CDC faces limitations in data reporting and resistance testing from hospitals, as well as challenges ensuring that its resistant gonorrhea surveillance system is representative of the population. CDC also faces challenges in reporting complete and timely information on the magnitude of and trends in resistance. For example, CDC does not have a plan for more frequent dissemination of consolidated reporting on priority pathogens at regular intervals. By developing such a plan, CDC would have more timely trend data and other information necessary for users of the data, including policymakers, to prioritize, plan, implement, and evaluate public health actions to address resistance. Federal agencies have helped advance diagnostic tests and promoted their use, but these efforts have limitations. Specifically, HHS and DOD have funded studies and taken other steps to advance testing, but they have not defined leadership roles, roles, and responsibilities to address a key barrier to the use of tests: a lack of clinical outcome studies. FDA has taken additional steps, but it has not regularly monitored test updates. By regularly monitoring and evaluating FDA-authorized tests that rely on out-of-date breakpoints, FDA would be better positioned to determine whether test manufacturers are updating breakpoints as needed and help ensure that patient care and infection control efforts are effective. Experts, federal officials, and antibiotic developers have identified other challenges, including the lack of new antibiotics and economic and other economic challenges, to developing treatments for resistant infections. Experts and federal officials have noted that it is challenging to develop antibiotics that can kill certain types of bacteria, called gram-negative bacteria, largely due to their double membrane that makes it difficult for antibiotics to enter the bacterial cell, and to pumps that can remove the drug once it enters. In addition, experts noted that as bacteria continue to evolve new ways to resist antibiotics, it is difficult for scientists to keep pace by developed new treatments that can overcome those mechanisms. As the rate of antibiotic discovery has slowed, scientists have also begun to explore alternatives to traditional antibiotics—which GAO calls “nontraditional products” in this report. Many types of nontraditional antibacterial products are currently being researched and developed to treat antibiotic resistant infections, including live biotherapeutic products, antibodies, and bacteriophages. Federal efforts to support antibiotic development have not fully incentivized antibiotic development, and HHS lacks a strategy to develop new incentives. Experts have called for additional postmarket pull incentives to increase the antibiotic pipeline, but HHS has not developed a strategy for doing so.
Federal law and regulations require that contractors receiving a contract with a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold must ensure that small businesses have the "maximum practical opportunity" to receive subcontracting work. In addition, a prospective contractor generally must submit a subcontracting plan for each solicitation or contract modification with more than $700,000--or $1.5 million for construction contracts--whenever subcontracting opportunities exist. GAO was asked to review oversight of subcontracting plans. This report examines (1) the extent to which select agencies conduct oversight related to small business subcontracting Plans in the pre-award phase of the federal contracting process; (2) how select agencies conducted oversight of such plans in the post-awards phase; and (3) steps the Small Business Administration (SBA) has taken to encourage agencies to conduct oversight activities related to these plans. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 26 contracts awarded in fiscal years 2016–2018 by four agencies with a mix of military and civilian agencies. These agencies were the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the Department of the Navy (Navy), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). GAO selected these agencies based on factors such as dollar amounts of federal contracts awarded and SBA's annual procurement scorecard, among other things. The four agencies could not demonstrate they consistently implemented all required pre-Award procedures for subcontracting. For example, for 25 of the 26 contracts reviewed, the agencies provided documentation showing that contracting officers reviewed and approved subcontracting planning plans. However, for 12 of these 12 contracts, the contracting officer did not provide documentation that indicated whether the plan was reviewed or approved. For the remaining 12 contracts across the four agencies, contracting officers provided documentation demonstrating that they reviewed the plan or were provided the opportunity to review the plan. The selected agencies provide some training to contracting officers to help ensure contractors meet their subcontracting reporting requirements, but contracting officers did not ensure contractors met their reporting requirements for more than half of the contracts reviewed. Contracting officers also accepted subcontracting report submissions with erroneous subcontracting goal information for several contracts. According to agency officials, several factors contributed to this, including contracting officers' large workload and focus on the award process rather than on contract administration, which can contribute to not conducting related due diligence after the contract award. SBA provides training to federal agencies' contracting officers and contractors to assist in complying with subcontracting requirements. As part of its Small Business Subcontracting Program, SBA conducts certain reviews, including compliance reviews, to assess contractor compliance with its subcontracting program requirements. For these reviews, SSA's Commercial Market Representatives (CMR) reviewed a sample of about 4,000 contracts in fiscal year 2019 or later with individual plans that had a small business subcontracted outlay of about $2.5 billion. SMA lacks documentation for almost all compliance reviews conducted in three of the four fiscal years from 2016 through 2019, has not fully implemented revisions to the compliance review process, and has not yet developed procedures for ensuring clear and consistent records of all compliance review reviews are documented and maintained. By having clear, consistent documentation for compliance reviews and maintaining those records, the agency would be better position itself to track contractor compliance for contracts it reviews and would be able to use this information to inform subsequent reviews. Additionally, contracting agencies could leverage the information from SBA for their own reviews.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides care for about 27,000 veterans with spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions. VA's research program aims to improve veterans' health by funding research on issues that affect veterans, developing effective treatments for veterans, and recruiting and retaining VA researchers. ORD, within VA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), manages VA's intramural research program. GAO was asked to review VA's efforts to translate research findings into clinical practice. This report examines (1) how VA sets research priorities for funding research projects and how ORD incorporates these priorities when funding research, and (2) the extent to which ORD and other VA entities facilitate translating research findings from research to clinical practice to improve the care veterans receive. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed VA documents and interviewed officials from ORD's four research services and the Cooperative Studies Program, which funds large-scale, multi-site clinical trials and epidemiological research on diseases affecting veterans. VA leadership sets VA's national research priorities based on input from internal and external stakeholders and other factors, such as veterans service organizations and Congress, and ORD officials said they use a range of approaches to incorporate those priorities when they fund research projects. For example, ORD may fund collaborative research efforts focused on specific priorities such as suicide prevention, or may fund a meritorious project that addresses one of its research priorities in lieu of another project that was ranked similarly or higher but does not address a priority. In addition to the research priorities, VA officials told GAO they consider other clinical and research needs when funding VA research, including encouraging researchers to test new ideas in clinical areas that are not identified as priorities but are still important to veterans’ health. VA has a variety of efforts to facilitate translation of research findings, including those undertaken by ORD’s Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) program, its health services research service, and its Diffusion of Excellence Initiative, which aims to encourage practitioner implementation of research-based practices outside of ORD. VA officials described efforts to coordinate with national program offices—such as those for clinical specialties such as mental health or spinal cord injury care—to inform research priorities and to encourage the translation of VA research into practice, which can help VA meet its broader goal of ensuring its research is benefiting veterans health. For instance, one VA program office developed a “road map” for suicide prevention that identifies remaining questions related to suicide prevention to be addressed by VA and other researchers, categorized by type of research (e.g., epidemiological or intervention). ORD also has recently begun requesting that researchers engage and collaborate with relevant program offices during the planning process for large multi- site clinical trials, including seeking input from program offices on research proposals. Coordination between the research program and program offices also can facilitate the conduct of the research itself, encouraging research that is viable and relevant to be conducted and translated into practice. VA recognizes the importance of this coordination and continues to actively pursue effective coordination strategies.
The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a joint federal-state program that provides health insurance for certain low-income children under age 19. States may operate CHIP as an extension of their Medicaid programs or as a separate program, with some additional flexibility in how they design their programs, such as determining which benefits to offer and how, if at all, to charge premiums. GAO was asked to review issues related to CHIP. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which states reported indicators of potential CHIP crowd-out to CMS and (2) what is known about the extent of CHIProwd-out and the procedures states use to prevent it. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed CMS and state CHIP annual reports and interviewed CMS officials and officials from six selected states with separate CHIP programs, which were selected based on variation in the number of children enrolled in CHIP and other factors, including CHIP enrollment rates. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. States reported two indicators to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)—the agency within HHS that administers CHIP—of potential crowd- out to CMS in their annual reports, although some do not report on these indicators and those that do may calculate them differently. For example, four of the 42 states reported that they tracked the percentage of individuals who have access to private health insurance; the remaining 38 states either did not report tracking this information or did not respond to this question. The states also varied in the extent that they have processes for directly estimating crowd-outs; however, officials in selected states told GAO they understand the occurrence of crowd- outs to be low. For instance, one selected state directly measures crowd- Out, while the other five states do not actively measure it. CMS officials said they have no plans to develop additional strategies for collecting states' Crowd-out information, because states have not reported crowd-Out to be a concern, and there is no need to re-examine states' oversight if prevalence as measured in research is likely low. CMS tracks states' procedures to prevent CHIP Crowd-Out; states ask applicants about other sources of coverage and use cost-Sharing Provisions. All 42 states with CHIP separate programs reported to CMS that they had implemented at least one of six types of procedures—such as asking about other health insurance and denying CHIP coverage if other sources are identified—to prevent crowd out. The majority of these states (36 of 42 states) reported implementing at least three of these procedures. The effect of some of the procedures is unclear, as relatively few studies have examined the issue, and according to selected state officials and stakeholders, some procedures may have unintended consequences. Several CHIP officials GAO interviewed believed their procedures are effective, but they either had not studied their procedures or could not speak to the effectiveness of any particular procedure. Two of the six states GAO selected for review—New York and North Carolina—reported that their procedures were effective in reducing the potential for CHIP "crowd out," which occurs when individuals drop or decide not to enroll in insurance offered by their employers and enroll their children inCHIP because of its availability. However, as GAO has reported in the past, assessments of the potential to crowd out should consider the affordability and availability of the employer-sponsored insurance available and affordable to families who qualify for CHIC. For children under 19, private insurance is the most prevalent source of insurance for children, but there is substantial variation across states in coverage rates. In eight states, fewer than 40 percent of children were insured through an employer in 2017. In contrast, in Utah, more than 60 percent of families with children wereinsured by an employer. The extent of these families' access to insurance varied by family income, and the percentage who were offered insurance by their employer varied by income. For some families, CHIP may be more affordable than private insurance, but for others it may be less affordable.
The Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is undertaking an extensive, multifaceted effort to sustain and modernize U.S. nuclear weapons, and explosives are essential to the functioning of these weapons. NNSA's five sites conduct a range of interdependent activities to design and produce explosives and about 100 different nuclear weapon components that contain explosive materials, such as high melting explosive (HMX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB). GAO was asked to review NNSAs management of explosives activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which NNSA has developed a centralized approach to managing its explosives activities and (2) the challenges NNSA and its contractors have identified related to explosives-related activities. GAO reviewed NNSA documents and interviewed NNSA officials and contractor representatives at five NNSA sites that conduct explosives activities, selected based on factors such as workforce size and location, among other things. The five sitesLivermore, Los Alamos, Sandia, Pantex, Nevada, and Sandia National Security Siteconduct a wide range of activities, including explosives research and development, testing, production, and storage. The Department of Defense (DOD) and NNSA rely on several third-party suppliers of explosive materials and related equipment, including Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Kingsport, Tennessee, which produces TATB, a key insensitive high explosive used in nuclear and conventional weapons. DOD has qualified the Holston-produced TATBs for use in conventional weapons but has not yet qualified them for nuclear weapons because the material properties of the formulated material are not yet up to NNSA standards, according to DOD documentation. In December 2018, NNSA completed the last production unit for the W76-1 life extension program (LEP), marking the completion of warhead production for the first LEP in which the agency undertook full-scale design activities for weapon systems since 1982. Five other LEPs and stockpile modernization efforts were ongoing as of January 2019. As GAO concluded in an April 2017 report, this is a particularly challenging time for NNSA, as the agency plans to simultaneously execute LEP and modernization efforts along with major construction projects, including efforts to modernize its uranium and plutonium manufacturing capabilities. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 as amended (GPRA) requires federal agencies to develop strategic plans, and GAO has reported that effective strategic plans should include a mission statement, long-term goals and objectives, strategies to achieve those goals, and a description of how performance measures will be used to assess progress toward those goals. The strategic plan for energetic materials, which represents a positive step toward managing explosives in a forward-looking, enterprise-wide approach, does not discuss three of the significant challenges identified by NNSA in conducting explosives activitiesdata quality, workforce levels, and safety. As NNSA revises its strategic plan in 2020, by discussing these challenges and actions planned to address them, as appropriate, or documenting the rationale for why the challenges were not included, the agency would have better assurance that it is effectively managing challenges that present risks to achieving its objectives. The plan also does not contain fully developed elements of an effective strategic plansuch as a fully developed and clearly identified mission statement and performance goals that are quantifiable, have time frames for completion, and list responsible parties to carry out specific activities for all strategic goalswhich would help make the plan more useful in measuring goal achievement and assessing accountability.
Since 1990, GAO's High-Risk List has designated federal programs and operations as high-risk because of their vulnerability to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. Since 1990, the list has grown to include areas such as national security, health care, energy, transportation, financial services, and the environment, among others. GAO added the Environmental Liability area to the list in 2005 and the Social Security area in 2011. In addition, in 2016, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) added government-wide personnel security to the High-risk list. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for implementing the Government-wide Personnel Security Improvement and Improvement Act of 2016 (PMIAA), which is intended to improve program and project management in certain larger federal agencies. Since GAO first added the area of strategic human capital management in 2001, OMB has continued to demonstrate its leadership commitment through guidance and sponsorship of key initiatives intended to help agencies address mission-critical skills gaps within their workforces. However, as of December 2018, OPM had not fully implemented 29 of the 34 recommendations GAO has made since 2012 relating to this area. Since 2017, 24 of 34 areas have either met or partially met all five criteria for removal from the list—leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, monitoring, and demonstrated progress—and 10 areas have neither met nor partially met one or more of these criteria. Three areas—NASA Acquisition Management, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) process for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals, and Limiting the federal government's fiscal exposure by better managing climate change risks—have regressed in their ratings since GAO last reported on these areas in 2017. The other three areas—DOD Support Infrastructure Management, DOD Financial Management, and DOD Business Systems Modernization—remain at high risk. In the past, senior management officials from OMB, applicable agencies, and GAO have met to address areas where additional management attention could be beneficial. Effective implementation of PMIAA provides an important opportunity to enhance progress on high- risk areas by focusing leadership attention through the portfolio reviews and trilateral meetings. Further, while progress is needed across all high risk areas, nine additional areas require significant attention to address imminent, longstanding, or particularly broad issues affecting the nation. These include the acquisition-related areas for the Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as well as the federal role in housing finance, which has substantially increased the government's exposure to potential mortgage losses since the 2007–2009 financial crisis. In December 2019 GAO will report on OMB's progress in implementing PMIAa, including what further steps it has taken to use the portfolio review process to address issues on its High- Risk List.
Military commissions are a form of military tribunal convened to try individuals for unlawful conduct associated with war. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the President issued an order directing the Secretary of Defense to establish commissions to try certain individuals for violations of the laws of war and other offenses. In 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the military commissions established under the President's order. In response to the court's ruling, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006. In 2009, Congress replaced the Act and established procedures governing the use of military commissions. GAO was asked to review issues related to public access to military commissions' proceedings. This report describes (1) how DOD currently facilitates public access; (2) the challenges, if any, that the public faces in gaining access to or obtaining information on these proceedings; and (3) what is known about potential options to address public access challenges, including any related tradeoffs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant documents, surveyed victims and their family members and non-government stakeholders, and interviewed DOD officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken various steps to facilitate the public's access to the proceedings of the National Special Operations Base (NSGB), where military commissions are currently being held, using four primary methods to do so. First, DOD communicates directly with victims and family members about the status of scheduled hearings and other administrative matters. Second, due to space limitations, DOD is currently able to allot 52 seats for selected members of the public to view "open" proceedings in-person from the courtroom gallery on NSGB. Third, DOD provides air transportation to and from NSGB for all individuals approved to view the proceedings. Fourth, in 2012, DOD established five CCTV sites on the East Coast where individuals may view proceedings remotely. Finally, DOD makes information, such as court documents that will be used during proceedings, available to the public on the commissions' website. The public faces a variety of challenges accessing or obtaining the information on commissions' Proceedings. These challenges can be categorized into two groups: those that DOD has limited ability to address, and those that it has greater ability to addresses. For example, DOD's inability to post court documents in a timely manner has negatively impacted stakeholders' ability to perform their role in facilitating public access, according to GAO's analysis of data collected from the commission's website from June 19 to November 19, 2018. For the remainder, nearly 1,300 court documents either remained unposted or were posted after DOD's timeliness standard of 15 business days, which GAO refers to as the “file date.” GAO also found that the hearing schedule posted on the website frequently is not updated to reflect schedule changes. DOD officials attributed this to a policy decision to subject the large volume of court documents filed, including schedule changes, to the same type of security review. A number of options exist to potentially help DOD address the challenges facing the public attending hearings at NSGB, but each option has tradeoffs that have not been assessed by DOD. Specifically, a physical expansion of the courtroom viewing gallery, along with a change in DOD policy to allow more visitors, would enable NSGB to accommodate more people wishing to view proceedings. However, an OMC official cautioned that expanding the gallery's capacity would likely increase the cost of the current $14 million expansion project, though the official was unable to estimate by how much. In addition, an increase in the number of visitors would require a commensurate increase in logistical support—for example, more lodging and utilities—which an OMB official said may not be supported by the current level of resources. In discussions with GAO, DOD officials noted that there may be ways to address some of these concerns. For instance, by adding or changing the locations of CCTV sites and broadcasting video of hearings via the internet or television, which would increase opportunities for the general public to watch hearings remotely. While there are a number of potential options for expanding public access—well supported by victims, family members, and other stakeholders that GAO surveyed—DOD officials have cited various tradeoffs, in the form of concerns over resources and national security, among others. While DOD officials' concerns may be warranted, until DOD fully assesses these tradeoffs by identifying and analyzing the potential risks and challenges, it may be missing an opportunity to expand public access.
The SBIR and STTR programs provide funding to federal agencies to support small business innovation and technology through research and development (SBIR) and technology transfer (STTR) activities. The Small Business Act and policy directive require agencies to notify awardees of their decision within 90 calendar days and require NIH and NSF to do so in 1 year. GAO was asked to review the timeliness of the award process for these programs. This report examines (1) the timeling of SBIRs and STTs for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and (2) the extent to which component agencies notified awardees within the required time period for each of the 3 fiscal years GAO examined. To do this work, GAO analyzed data from 28 component agencies, reviewed agency policies and procedures, and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Education provided written comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Overall, component agencies reviewed proposals for 12,890 of the 15,453 awards that GAO reviewed (84 percent) and notified awardee applicants and awardees for 2,533 of 15,457 awards (16 percent) within the 90-day time period required by the Small Business and Small Business Administration's (SBA) Small Business Innovation Research and Small business Technology Transfer (STT) policy directive for fiscal year 2016 through fiscal year 2018. Three of the 28 components met the notification requirement for every award in the data reviewed, and nine additional component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 16 component agencies met the requirement for less than 90 percent. For example, the Department of Energy's Office of Science and the Army Science and Technology Directorate's Small Business Technology Transfer program each had a single fiscal year during which they notified less than 50 percent of awardees. Agency officials described several factors that affect the time spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees, including the availability of reviewers, the number of proposals to review, and other agency-specific factors. Some component agencies reported that the time needed to review proposals and notify award recipients varies depending on the type of award and the amount of funding available for the award. For instance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology's National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are directed to complete proposal review and notification within 1 year, while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is required to complete its review within 2 years. In addition, some component agency officials identified factors specific to their agency or process as factors affecting the time to issue awards, such as the length of time it takes to review a contract's accounting system. For some component agencies GAO interviewed, cost reimbursement contracts took longer to issue than fixed-price contracts because of the need to review an awardee's accounting systems in accordance with federal acquisition regulations, according to officials from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). GAO found in February 2019 that DOD does not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner and recommended that the department develop such a mechanism.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health care coverage to certain low-income individuals and families. States are responsible for determining individuals' eligibility for Medicaid and enrolling them into the program. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for overseeing states' eligibility determinations. In fiscal year 2014, CMS suspended the Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (MEQC) program and the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program to provide states with time to adjust to eligibility process changes in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010. As a result, CMS did not publish an updated national estimate of improper payments due to Medicaid eligibility errors for fiscal years 2015 through 2018. GAO was asked to review states' Medicaid eligibility processes. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected states have processes in place to ensure the accuracy of their Medicaid eligibility determination processes and (2) how states rank the bases of eligibility to which individuals are assigned and how these decisions can vary among selected states. To do this work, GAO reviewed 47 state and federal audits of states' compliance with PPACA, published from 2014 through 2018, and interviewed officials from CMS and five selected states—New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, New Mexico, and Oklahoma—that expanded their Medicaid populations under PPACA. The five states in GAO's review considered similar factors when ranking the basis of eligibility—such as bases related to children, pregnant women, or disabled individuals—but the basis in which individuals were placed could vary. For example, the selected states considered the length of the enrollment period for certain populations, such as pregnant mothers (pregnant women who were also eligible as caretakers of dependent children). GAO also reviewed the degree to which states integrated their eligibility systems and processes, which could affect how individuals are assessed for potential bases of Medicaid eligibility and potentially result in different determinations of eligibility. The selected states GAO interviewed reported having processes that were designed to avoid or address many, but not all, of the accuracy issues identified in the 47 audits GAO identified. The accuracy issues GAO found generally fell into nine broad categories, including incorrect or incomplete income or asset information, unresolved discrepancies between what applicants reported as their income and electronic data sources, and unidentified or unaddressed changes in circumstances such as changes in household income or size. In some cases, the issues identified by auditors resulted in errors in eligibility determination. However, in other instances the issues did not result in erroneous determinations; for example, in some cases the audit found that a state determined that an applicant was eligible based on incomplete financial information; however, auditors found that the applicant would have still been eligible for Medicaid even after reviewing additional financial information. In other cases, audit findings found that eligibility determination procedures complied with state policies and federal requirements, but that changes in state policies could provide more information that could be used to improve eligibility determinational processes. In 1983, CMS implemented its statutory requirement to recoup funds associated with Medicaid eligibility-related improper payments for states with an eligibility error rate above 3 percent through its MEQC program, which required states to randomly sample Medicaid enrollees to verify eligibility. In 1992, HHS's Departmental Appeals Board—the department's final level of administrative review—concluded that the error rate was not sufficiently accurate to provide reliable evidence to support recoupment of funds due to the small sample size from which the rate was calculated. Consequently, the appeals board stated that it was “impossible to conclude with a reasonable certainty that the States failed to meet their target rates….” CMS provided states the option, beginning in 1994, to either continue operating a traditional MEZC program or to conduct what CMS referred to as “MEZC pilots,” which focused on prospective improvements in eligibility determination practices rather than calculation of error rates. Since the pilots did not produce an error rate, CMS could not recoup federal funds expended for states participating in the pilots. Between 2012, the earliest year for which CMS has maintained records, and 2014, 39 states participated in these pilots exempting them from possible recoupments due to eligibility errors. While the other 12 states that continued to operate traditional MEQc programs could still be subject to recouped funds, CMS officials reported that no recoups related to eligibility error had occurred
The MIECHV program is the primary federal program focusing exclusively on evidence-based home visiting during pregnancy and early childhood, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In fiscal years 2013 through 2018, the number of families served and number of home visits conducted nearly doubled (see table). HRSA provides formula grant funding to states based partly on the proportion of children under age 5 living in poverty in each state, among other factors. In fiscal year 2018, states received an average of $6.9 million, ranging from $1.2 million provided to North Dakota to $21.4 million to California. GAO was asked to review state spending on home visiting. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have met the MOE requirement and (2) the methods HRSA uses to monitor state compliance with the requirement. To do this work, GAO analyzed state MOE spending data for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and interviewed HRSA officials and state officials from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, reviewed HRSA monitoring documentation, and interviewed state home visiting program officials. HHS reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. From fiscal year 2016 through 2017, state-reported maintenance of effort (MOE) spending for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Formula (MIECHV) program varied from $0 to more than $25 million, and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) determined that states generally met the program's MOE requirements because there was no supplantation of federal funds. For example, 28 states reported spending $0 on MOE in fiscal year2018, while 23 states reported a total of $3 million in MOE for that year. In addition, 15 states reported decreases in their reported MOE Spending from fiscal years2016 through 2018. According to HRSA, there were three different reasons why states might have reported a decrease in their MOE spent compared to the prior year: 1. A state made a technical error in its MOE calculation that subsequently was corrected; 2. Circumstances outside of the state agency's control contributed to the state reporting decreased funding, such as when a state legislature authorized budget cuts that affected home visiting funding or failed to pass a budget; or 3. The clarification to MOE guidance that HRSA made in the fiscal year 2014 NOFO limited the spending states should report, as previously discussed. HRSA monitors the MIECHVs program through a variety of methods, including grant application reviews, site visits, and financial assessments, among others. For fiscal year 2017, HRSA completed four operational site visit reports, and two of these reports had findings related to inaccurate state- Reported State-Reported Maintenance of Effort Spending for Fiscal Years 2016-2018 (see figure). For fiscal years 2017 and 2018, state officials reported that they did not have internal controls in place to ensure that state spending met the minimum MOE reporting requirements. In three of the four single audits that identified deficiencies, the state agencies concurred with the findings and prepared corrective action plans to address the deficiencies. As of June 2019,HRSA officials said they have taken steps, or are planning steps, to modify or provide additional guidance related to how the agency monitors how states report their spending. Specifically, beginning with the formula grant NOFO for fiscal year 2019 (FY2019), HRSA added an additional column for states to provide the expenditures for the 2 years prior to the current fiscal year of the application. In February 2019, it also published an internal grants policy bulletin that specifically addressed MOE and monitoring of those requirements for all HRSA programs.
NNSA is responsible for managing national nuclear security missions, including ensuring a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent; supplying nuclear fuel to the Navy; and supporting the nation's nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee is the primary site among these with enriched uranium capabilities. In 2004, NNSA proposed to replace aging infrastructure and relocate key uranium processing equipment at Y- 12 without jeopardizing uranium production operations. NNSA estimated that the project would cost $4.2 billion to $6.5 billion, with the latter being the project's maximum allowable cost. However, in 2013, an external review estimated the project could cost as much as $11 billion. GAO was asked to review NNSA's uranium program. This report examines the extent to which NNSA has (1) identified and made progress implementing the uranium program's scope of work, (2) developed an integrated master schedule and life-cycle cost estimate for the program, (3) obtained independent cost estimates for the project, and (4) used information from the independent cost estimate and external independent review reports to inform the UPF's cost and schedule baseline estimates. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed NNSA documents and interviewed NNSA officials. Since GAO last reported in September 2017, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has made progress in implementing its uranium program and has developed a program schedule and cost estimate—key management information for the nuclear security program. Specifically, in December 2019, in response to GAO's schedule guide and other best practices and as required by NNSA program management policy, the agency developed a master schedule that includes all of the program's capabilities and elements, as well as other work that may affect the program through fiscal year 2035. According to NNSA, the schedule includes the key milestones for each uranium program capability and element, such as project completion (CD-4) and operational release, since these key milestones are important for tracking the uranium programs' critical path of activities and for overall program management. The program's integrated schedule also includes the $7.4 billion in program costs from fiscal years 2016 through 2026 to support its uranium processing modernization efforts. In addition, the program also includes over $850 million in costs for developing the uranium processing capabilities that are not part of the UpF project, integrating those capabilities with it, improving the infrastructure of existing buildings, and transitioning out of Building 9212, which is to be phased out by 2035, according to the estimate. NSA officials stated that they expect to update the estimate with additional program costs, once known, and will include any additional future scope added to the program. N NSA has also developed a plan to receive start-up authorization for UPF operations in 2025 and to attain full operational capability in 2026. In February 2018, DOE and NNSA approved this plan, which outlines three major risks associated with the project that NNSA will need to address so that the program can attain full capability. These risks include ensuring that all systems are able to function as designed and that the programs' systems can interface with other facilities' systems as designed, among other things. In June 2018, N NSA prepared a strategy to guide its negotiation of the remaining UPF project work that had not yet been priced with the contractor. Based on its review of the strategy and GAO analysis of NNSA and contractor documents, GA OMB found that the agency used DOE-PM's independent cost estimating and independent reviews to negotiate at least 14 of the 22 major and minor issues identified for discussion. These 14 issues included, for example, reducing concrete and freight direct costs, reducing the margin added to cover any increase in design scope, reducing subcontractor indirect costs, and increasing accuracy of other cost estimates. In March 2018, the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved NNSA for start of construction for three of the seven UPF subprojects, and in December 2017, DOE's Office of the Deputy Secretary for Project Management and Procurement Policy (OMP) approved the program for the remaining three subprojects. In December 2018, all seven subprojects' formal scopes of work and baseline estimates were approved, and by March 2018 NNSA gained approval to start construction on them.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for overseeing the safety and efficacy of drugs and biological products, such as vaccines, sold in the United States. While FDA reviews most drug applications using its standard review process, FDA's priority review designation is intended to reduce the review time needed to bring a drug to market for certain drugs that treat serious conditions. FDA awards priority review vouchers (PRV) to drug sponsors that submit applications for drugs that would provide significant improvements in safety or effectiveness compared to available drugs. PRVs are intended to encourage the development of drugs for tropical diseases, rare pediatric diseases, and medical countermeasures. GAO was asked to review FDA's PRV programs. This report examines (1) the number of PRVs awarded by FDA, (2) the extent to which drug sponsors have redeemed PRVs, and (3) the views of researchers, drug sponsors, and stakeholders on the programs' effectiveness as an incentive for drug development. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FDA data on PRVs and interviewed FDA officials and drug sponsors and researchers, among other things. As of September 30, 2019, FDA awarded 31 PRVs across its three priority review voucher programs, with the majority awarded through the rare pediatric disease PRV program. FDA awarded PRVs for drugs to treat 27 different diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, smallpox, spinal muscular atrophy, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Drug sponsors may redeem a PRV when they submit a drug application for a drug that would not otherwise qualify for priority review. Redemptions of the PRVs have occurred for drugs treating a variety of conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), type 2 diabetes, and different forms of arthritis. FDA does not track the resources it uses specifically for the programs, so the agency cannot determine if the PRV user fees it collects cover the associated costs. FDA officials told GAO that each new PRVs program--and changes made to existing PRVs--requires additional resources to implement. The agency reports that the services of over 11 offices within FDA are required to work on some aspect of the programs. According to FDA, the agency also expend and divert agency resources to draft and revise PRV-related guidance; update webpages; research, draft, and publish notices and orders to add or decline to add diseases to the list of eligible tropical diseases; respond to inquiries from sponsors, potential sponsors, investors, attorneys, and other interested individuals; and respond to requests for a rare pediatric Disease PRV designation. In addition to suggesting improvements to the programs to encourage drug development, stakeholders GAO contacted, as well as GAO's literature review, identified potential alternatives to PRVs that provide incentives for drug research and development. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances health care for certain low-income individuals and families. The federal government and states share responsibility for the financing and administration of the program, with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the federal level responsible for overseeing states' design and operation of their Medicaid programs and ensuring that federal funds are appropriately spent. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended) requires that GAO report at least every 60 days on PPACA implementation and oversight. GAO's prior work has identified a number of weaknesses in CMS's oversight of Medicaid. For example, in 2015, GAO found that CMS did not review federal Medicaid eligibility determinations in the states that delegated such authority to the federal government. CMS has taken some steps to address these weaknesses, but GAO continues to believe that additional actions are needed. This testimony discusses (1) gaps in CMS oversight of the Medicaid program, (2) CMS efforts to improve program oversight, and (3) opportunities for CMS to further collaborate with stakeholders to improve oversight and ensure appropriate enrollment. This statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from October 2015 through December 2017, with selected updates conducted in January and February 2019. GA O has previously reported that gaps exist in CMS’s oversight of states’ Medicaid programs, including oversight of enrollment and expenditures. CMS oversight is critical to ensuring that only eligible individuals are enrolled, that they are enrolled in the correct eligibility group, and that states' expenditures are appropriately matched with federal funds for Medicaid enrollees. However, previous GAO work has found that gaps in oversight exist in several key areas, including Medicaid enrollment, oversight of state expenditures, and oversight of federal Medicaid determinations, which affect the federal matching rate. In addition, CMS has acknowledged the need for improved Medicaid data and has begun an effort with states to improve its collection of Medicaid expenditure and utilization data, which could benefit program oversight. The Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) initiative is the agency's primary effort—conducted jointly with states—to improve the quality of state-reported data, as well as the data's usefulness for states. T- MSIS also is intended to benefit states by reducing the number of reports CMS requires them to submit, and by improving program efficiency by allowing states to compare their data with other states' data in the national repository or with information in other CMS repositories, including Medicare data. While recognizing CMS's progress, in 2017 GAO made several recommendations aimed at improving the quality and usefulness of T-MSIs data. CMS concurred with these recommendations, but has not fully implemented them. Further collaboration with stakeholder stakeholders could improve oversight of program oversight and better ensure appropriate enrollments. CMS is engaged with state agencies and other partners to promote program integrity through the Medicaid Integrity Institute, a national training program for states, and other partnerships to combat Medicaid fraud. These efforts have created more opportunities for program integrity professionals to collaborate, share best practices, and ultimately increase the effectiveness of their oversight activities. State auditors are uniquely positioned to help CMS in its oversight of their state Medicaid programs because of their roles and responsibilities—which can include carrying out or overseeing their state's single audits. Through their program integrity reviews, state auditors have identified improper payments and deficiencies in the processes used to identify them. In April 2019, the Comptroller General and representatives from the National State Auditors Association sent a letter to CMS requesting changes to the Compliance Supplement, which is issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) based on agency input and direction. In June 2019, OMB issued the 2019 Compliance supplement, which included changes related to overseeing testing of eligibility determinational processes that had been proposed by GAO and the auditors. Specifically, the supplement now permits state auditing agencies to test eligibility determination processes to ensure that beneficiaries qualify for the program and are in the appropriate enrollment category. The supplement also notes a requirement for states to coordinate with other state and federal insurance affordability programs, such as the federally facilitated exchanges. These changes will better enable auditors to audit states to ensure beneficiaries qualify and are enrolled. Such determinations may yield insights into program weaknesses that CMS could learn from and potentially address nationally.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides or pays for long-term care—ranging from assistance with dressing and bathing to clinical care for spinal injuries or dementia—through three institutional and 11 noninstitutional programs. In February 2020, GAO reported that the number of veterans receiving care in VA's longterm care programs increased 14 percent from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, from 464,071 to 530,327 veterans, while spending grew 33 percent from $6.8 billion to $9.1 billion. GAO was asked to update its February 2020 report. This testimony discusses (1) the trends in utilization of and spending for VA long- term care programs and (2) key challenges VA faces in meeting veterans' long-Term Care needs. This statement is based on GAO's February 2020 review of VA data on utilization and spending, as well as prior GAO work. To conduct this work, we interviewed VA officials, reviewed VA documents, and conducted site visits to three VA medical centers (VAMC) selected to reflect variation in size and location, reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance, and interviewed other VA officials. As GAO previously reported in February 2020 (GAO-2020), VA data shows that utilization of long- Term Care—in terms of various VA workload units—and spending for these programs generally increased in recent years and are projected to increase in the future. Specifically, from fiscal year (FY) 2014 through FY 2018, utilization of VA long term care grew 14 percent and spending increased 33 percent, respectively, while expenditures increased from FY 2015 through FY 2016. These projected increases are due to a variety of factors, including that VA plans on providing care to an increasing number of aging veterans and veterans rated in the highest service-connected disability groups, expanding veterans' access to noninst institutional care programs, and veterans' preference to delay or reduce the amount of institutional care they receive. VA also projects that expenditures for institutional long care will decrease from 63 percent to 53 percent from FY 2017 through FY 2037 while the proportion of non-institutional program expenditures is projected to grow from 37 percent to 47 percent in that same time period. VA has identified a number of key challenges to meeting the demand for longTerm Care, but lacks measurable goals for addressing them. For example, VA has not established measurable goals to address workforce shortages, such as staffing targets to address the waitlist for the Home-Based Primary Care program, geographic alignment of care, or the need for specialty care for veterans with dementia. As a result, VA is limited in its ability to better plan for and understand progress towards addressing the challenges it faces meeting the needs of veterans. In addition, VA identified, but had not planned to take steps to fully address, challenges at the VAMC level that affect VA's ability to meet veterans' needs for care, for example, that VAMCs do not have a consistent approach to managing VA's 14 long-time care programs. VA officials told GAO that this fragmentation hinders standardization and the ability to get veterans the appropriate care.
In 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) allowed states to expand Medicaid eligibility to non-elderly, non-pregnant adults who are not eligible for Medicare and whose income does not exceed 133 percent of the federal poverty level. PPACA also required the establishment of health insurance exchanges in 2014—marketplaces where individuals may compare and select among health insurance plans offered by participating private insurers. PP ACA included a number of provisions that reduced these plans' costs—including premiums and cost-sharing, such as deductibles and copayments—for eligible enrollees, including certain AI/AN. GAO was asked to review issues related to health insurance coverage and third-party collections at federally operated IHS facilities. This report examines (1) the extent to which IHS patients have health insurance, and (2) how IHS collections and coverage have changed at selected federally operated and tribally operated facilities since 2013. To do this work, GAO analyzed IHS data from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, reviewed IHS documents, interviewed IHS officials, and interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable sample of 17 facilities selected based on size, location, and other factors, and national tribal organizations. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not have any comments on a draft of this report. From fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2018, the percent of patients at 73 federally operated Indian Health Service (IHS) hospitals and health centers who reported having health care coverage increased an average of 14 percentage points, from 64 percent to 78 percent, according to GAO's analysis of data from the Indian Health Services Administration. The majority of coverage gains occurred in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 (see fig.). GAO found substantial variation in the magnitude of these increases. For example, increases at each of the 73 facilities ranged from a low of 2 to a high of 31 percentage points over this time period. In addition, the percentage of patients with coverage increased at 24 facilities by more than 10 percentage points during this period, while the number of patients seeking care at these facilities remained constant. IHS reported that a variety of factors may have contributed to these increases, including increased enrollment in health insurance and the expansion of services onsite and offsite through the private insurance exchanges. Third- party collections at all federally operated facilities increased 51 percent, from $708 million to $1.07 billion, from fiscal Years 2013 to 2018. For instance, Medicaid collections grew 47 percent from $496 million in 2013 to $729 million in 2018. Officials GAO interviewed from all 17 facilities reported that they used these collections to fund their continued operations, expand the services they offer onsite, and expand services they cover offsite under IHS's private insurance program. Officials from most of the 17 facilities also reported using third-Party Collection (PRC) funds to fund a substantial and increasing portion of their payroll costs and to ensure that their facilities met all required standards, including those required for ongoing accreditation. Officials at some of these facilities reported using PRC funds to expand the volume or scope of services they offered onsite as a way to better meet patients' medical needs. Officials also reported that an expansion of onsite services has reduced the need for some patients to travel long distances to obtain diagnostic services and specialty care through the PRC program, and that PRC has been able to pay for services such as patients' long-awaited knee and hip replacements, which have enabled patients to return to normal activities of life and reduce their need for pain management.
In 2015, EPA and USDA announced a national goal to reduce food loss and waste (FLW) in the United States by half by 2030. GAO was asked to review efforts to reduce FLW. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which EPA, USDA, and FDA have taken actions to plan and organize their efforts toward achieving the national FLW reduction goal and (2) the challenges that nonfederal stakeholders identified to reducing FLW and the extent that EPA and the agencies have taken initial actions to address these challenges. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency documents; interviewed EPA, FDA, and USDA officials; and interviewed representatives from a nongeneralizable sample of food industry, state, local, and nonprofit organizations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Food and Nutrition Service (FDA) have each taken some actions to organize and plan their own efforts toward reducing food losses and waste. For example, EPA issued a strategic plan in 2015 to guide its own efforts, and in 2018, the agencies signed a formal agreement to increase collaboration and coordination among the agencies on FLW efforts. In addition, USDA has taken a number of actions, such as establishing a FLW Reduction Liaison to coordinate federal, state and local efforts to measure and reduce the incidence of FLW, issuing guidance on how to minimize food waste for donated commodities, and establishing a milk donation program to encourage the donation of milk products. However, these agencies have not yet taken certain steps that align with key practices for interagency collaboration, including agreeing on roles and responsibilities; developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results; clearly defining short- and long-term outcomes; identifying how leadership commitment will be sustained; and ensuring that the relevant stakeholders have been included in the collaborative effort. By incorporating such leading practices as they implement their interagency strategic plan, the three agencies would have better assurance that they are effectively collaborating toward achieving their national FLw reduction goal. Nonfederal and state stakeholders GAO interviewed cited various challenges that exist to reducing the amount of food lost and wasted in theUnited States. These challenges include limited data and information about the amounts and causes of FLw; a lack of awareness and education about FLW; and limited infrastructure and capacity, which can hamper reduction efforts. Since announcing the national reduction goal in 2015, USDA and EPA have begun to address challenges in the three key areas identified by nonf federal stakeholders to reduceFLW. Specifically, EPA has published some data on food waste generation and management; USDA has provided some information about food waste at various stages of the food supply chain; and FDA has taken steps to educate consumers and food industry stakeholders about the importance of reducing food waste. EPA has also provided some technical assistance to states and local governments in developing anaerobic digestion projects, a technology to process wasted food that is more desirable than landfilling or incineration, according to EPA's Food Recovery Hierarchy. USDA has also taken some steps to increase its capacity to provide food for food-insecure people through food assistance programs and through its FoodKeeper application, a tool to provide consumers with specific storage advice, including storage timelines for the refrigerator and freezer for food and beverage items.
The Post-9/11 GI Bill is the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) largest educational assistance program for veterans. In fiscal year 2017, it provided $1.4 billion in tuition and fee payments to more than 700,000 student veterans to attend over 6,000 schools. VA pays schools directly for tuition and fees and sends additional payments for housing and books directly to veterans who are eligible for these payments. These payments are not considered when calculating eligibility for federal student aid and do not affect the amount of aid a veteran can receive from the U.S. Department of Education (Education). Student veterans may also be eligible for state and institutional aid (scholarships from state governments or schools, for example). GAO was asked to provide information on the number and types of student veterans who received Post- 9/11 postsecondary education benefits. This testimony is based on GAO's prior work examining (1) how many student veterans received postsecondary educational benefits under the GI Bill and the number of schools that received these benefits, (2) how student outcomes at schools receiving the most postsecondary benefits compared to the national average, and (3) the impact of school closures on student veterans. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency documents and interviewed VA officials. GAO also analyzed data from Education on postsecondary student outcomes for the 50 schools that had the highest amount of postsecondary tuition or fee payments in fiscal year (FY) 2017, the most recent year for which data were available at the time of this testimony. Nearly 700,00 student veterans attended almost 6,500 schools in FY 2017 with nearly $1 billion in postsecondary assistance payments under the post-9-11 Global War on Terrorism GI Bill, which took effect on August 1, 2009. In FY 2017, VA paid about 40 percent of these students tuition or fees to attend public schools, 30 percent to nonprofits and for-profit schools, and 30 percent for for-profits. The 50 schools received between $11 million and $191 million each in tuition, fee, and housing payments and enrolled between 350 and 28,000 beneficiaries. In contrast, among all schools receiving postsecondary aid in FY2017, the majority of them enrolled fewer than 15 veterans. Student outcomes at these 50 schools were, on average, generally comparable to the average for all schools, but varied more widely across sectors. For example, 4-year program graduation rates at these schools were 61 percent and retention rates were 83 percent, compared to 75 percent for schools that did not offer postsecondary degrees. School closures can affect thousands of students and result in large financial losses for the federal government and taxpayers. In 2017 GAO reported that about 95 schools closed in school year 2015-16, according to Education data, which was higher than in previous years, primarily due to a rise in school closures by for-Profit Education, which operated schools under multiple brands, including Argosy University and several campuses of The Art Institutes. More recently, closures at Education Corporation of America in 2018 and Dream Center Education Holdings in 2019 affected tens of Thousands of students, including thousands of Post-10/10 GI Bill recipients. As a result of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-291), VA restored GI Bill entitlements to eligible beneficiaries affected by recent and future school closures. In addition, student veterans may be entitled to a discharge on eligible federal student loans they may have received from Education or to have their Pell Grant eligibility restored if they are unable to complete a program because their school closed. Despite these options for having benefits restored and loans discharged, school closures can still create hardships for veterans, including difficulty transferring credits and continuing their education at a new school.
VA's FSS program provides federal agencies with a simplified process for obtaining commercial supplies and services at prices associated with volume buying. GAO was asked to review VA FSS. This report assesses: (1) what is known about VA's use of its FSS for fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) challenges the National Acquisition Center (NAC) faces in effectively managing the program; (3) the extent to which NAC awarded FSS contracts in a timely manner; and (4) whether FSS and the Medical-Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program provide overlapping or duplicative offerings. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data on FSS sales, reviewed policies and guidance, and interviewed VA and GSA officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program has been in place for more than 50 years and is used by VA and other federal agencies to obtain goods and services, ranging from office furniture to medical equipment and supplies. VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the only VA administration that uses the VA schedules, which are catalogs of related products and services from pre-approved vendors with established pricing that can be used to obtain items such as medical equipment, supplies, and services. In fiscal year 2018, VHA spent about $12 billion on the FSS, with sales of its eight non-pharmaceutical schedules largely flat compared to the rise in VHA's overall health care spending. VA does not have controls in place to ensure that vendors provide complete sales data—the key data used to calculate fees that finance the program. In an attempt to assess data completeness, NAC recently began comparing vendor data to Federal Procurement Data System Next Generation data for verification. However, because agencies do not report micro-purchases made via purchase card in FPDS-NG, this approach alone is not effective. NAC also does not analyze existing data on the number of veteran-owned small businesses that hold F SS contracts or which schedules have the most or least participation by these businesses. This information is important because VHA contracting officers must apply the “VA Rule of Two” before contracting with a non-veteran-owned business. The existence or lack of such businesses affects whether contracting officers can use FSS as a simplified means of making purchases, and NAC officials do not track the types of goods or services offered by veteran- owned small businesses on F SS schedules. Nac also has limited visibility into users' experience with the program and is not consistently obtaining and analyzing feedback from FSS users on their experience with it, despite having some tools to gather such information. For example, while NAC's website provides links to a customer survey, among other contact information, it has received minimal user feedback via these tools. FSS leadership acknowledged the importance of user feedback, and stated they would like to develop a more comprehensive feedback mechanism, such as email surveys sent to users on a periodic basis with questions specific to their F SS program experience. Without such a feedback mechanism to obtain and analyze user feedback on their FSS experience, Nac officials lack information that could provide insights on areas for improvement, including whether program improvements are needed. The NAC FSS office faces numerous challenges—some of which are VA-wide issues GAO has identified in prior reports—including inadequate training and leadership instability in the program, which has contributed to a backlog of FSS offers and delays in awarding contracts, among others. N AC FSS guidance and training for contracting staff is not comprehensive, which poses a risk of inefficient use of contracting staff. Further, limited collaboration between NAC and the General Services Administration (GSA) has resulted in missed opportunities to share tools and practices. These and other challenges faced by NAC were further exacerbated by a 3-year leadership gap in the Program Management and Resource Support team, which was created in 2015. These positions have since been filled; however, the effect of the gaps is still evident in some cases. Finally, while GAO found that NAC rarely met its timeliness goals for FSS contract awards from fiscal year 2014 to 2018, including for contract modifications—typically changes to contract items or prices—and that 319 of the 803 contract awards took at least double the 180-day goal for contract awards in fiscal years 2015 through 2018. NDC leadership has acknowledged these challenges and is
Pedestrian injuries and fatalities in U.S. motor vehicle crashes have increased in recent years. In 2018, there were about 79,800 pedestrian injuries and 6,300 pedestrian fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). GAO was asked to review issues related to pedestrian safety. This report (1) examines what is known about the relationship between motor vehicle characteristics and pedestrian injuries, (2) describes approaches automakers have taken to address pedestrian safety and discusses stakeholder perspectives on these approaches, and (3) evaluates actions NHTSA has taken to assess whether pedestrian safety testing should be included in its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal statutes, regulations, and program documents; analyzed data from 2008 through 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's analysis; and interviewed officials from 13 automakers, five auto equipment suppliers, and four auto industry trade associations, among others. GAO did not assess the effectiveness of pedestrian safety features in vehicles sold in the United States. The number of pedestrians struck and killed by motor vehicles increased from 2008 to 2018, and the estimated number of pedestrian injuries increased from about 71,000 in 2008 to about 80,800 in 2018. In 2008, pedestrian fatalities represented about 12 percent of overall highway fatalities, while in 2018 they represented about 17 percent. The Department of Transportation (DOT) administers NCAP and issues federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) and the federal bumper standard, among other things. In general, NCAP tests supplement safety standards established in law or regulation. However, pedestrian safety tests are not currently part of NCAP. In December 2015, in response to a request for comments, N HTSA proposed to include pedestrian crash avoidance and mitigation safety tests in NCAP, but has not yet made or communicated a decision as to whether to include these tests. In the past 10 years, since NCAP was last updated in July 2008 (with changes effective for model year 2011 vehicles), NHT SA has conducted research on pedestrian safety issues, such as developing objective test protocols and reliable test instruments, and proposed pedestrian crash mitigation tests for NCAP; however, it has yet to make or communicate a decision about including these tests in the program. In addition, in 2008, the United United States and other countries agreed to an international standard for pedestrian crash prevention and mitigation tests. This international standard, if implemented in a domestic regulation, would require vehicles to meet minimum performance requirements in these tests for vehicle hoods and bumpers to absorb energy more efficiently when impacted in a vehicle-to-pedestrian collision. The United States approved the international standard in 2008; but NHTsa has not initiated a rulemaking to implement it either as part of the FMVSS or adopt it as a testing protocol through NCAP (see fig.). GAO found that several vehicle characteristics, including the age and body type of the vehicle and the speed at which the vehicle was being driven, are associated with the increase in pedestrian fatalities from 2008-2018. For example, the number of reported pedestrian fatalities increased more for crashes involving vehicles that were: 11 years old or older (123 percent increase) compared with newer vehicles (9 percent increase); SUVs (68 percent increase), compared with other light trucks and passenger cars (25 percent increase; and traveling at reported speeds 31 mph and above (45 percent increase)—compared to vehicles traveling at lower speeds (28 percent increase). However, NHTS lacks complete data on the relationship with vehicle characteristics on pedestrian injuries. In its 2018 report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that while this study was the most complete set of pedestrian crash data available in theUnited States, the data are over 20 years old. NTSB recommended in 2018 that the agency develop a detailed and current pedestrian injury data set for local and state analysis and to model and simulate pedestrian collision avoidance systems. As of February 2020, however, the agency had not fully implemented this recommendation. In response, in 2018, NTSB initiated a pilot program to improve its data collection protocol for pedestrian injuries but lacks a plan to evaluate its results and determine whether and how it should be expanded. Automakers reported that various Pedestrian Safety Features are commonly available in new vehicle models and that all features have benefits and challenges. For instance, 12 of 13 automakers GAO interviewed reported that they offered one or more 2019 model year vehicles
Since 1990, GAO has designated high-risk areas on its High-Risk List, which is intended to highlight government programs and operations that are high risk due to their greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges. Since 1990, the list has grown to include areas such as national security, homeland security, transportation, financial management, general government, environmental, social and economic, and economic and social policy issues. GAO added the area of government-wide personnel security to the High-risk List in 2011. In addition, in 2015, GA OMB added the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) acquisition management to the list, and in 2017, the Office of Personnel Management's (OMB) and the General Services Administration's (GSA) information technology (IT) management were added. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which (1) agencies have made progress in addressing GAO's recommendations since GAO last reported on these areas in February 2017 and (2) additional areas need to be addressed in order for GAO to continue to rate these areas as high risk. To conduct this work,GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and other documents and interviewed officials from OMB, GSA, and relevant agencies. Since GAO issued its last high- risk report on February 2017, agencies have taken a number of actions to address recommendations GAO made in the areas identified in that report. These actions have resulted in improvements to programs and operation and improved service and significant financial benefits. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has continued to limit cost growth and schedule delays in the majority of its major projects. However, three areas—NASA's acquisition management, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) process for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals, and Limiting the Federal Government's Fiscal Exposure By Better Managing Climate Change Risks—have regressed in their ratings against GAO criteria for removal from the High Risk List since 2017. The ratings for the remaining four criteria remain unchanged and are partially met. The rating for one criterion—monitoring—regressed to not met in 2018, and the rating for the other four criteria—leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, monitoring, and demonstrated progress—remained unchanged in 2018. In December 2018, the President's Management Agenda Implementation Act of 2016 (PMIAA) was signed into law. OMB has produced a general strategy for implementing the law through 2022 and met some initial milestones required by PMIAA. According to OMB officials, it began implementing PMIAa's requirement to conduct portfolio reviews on high- Risk areas by requiring relevant agencies to provide several items for discussion during the 2018 Strategic Review meetings. These annual meetings are to consist primarily of a discussion of agency progress towards each of the strategic objectives outlined in their strategic plans, but also cover other management topics such as enterprise risk management and high risk area progress. In the past, OMB and applicable agencies and GAO have met to address areas where additional management attention could be beneficial to high risk issues. These trilateral meetings, beginning in 2007, have continued across administrations. Effective implementation of PMIA a provides an important opportunity to enhance progress on high risk areas by focusing leadership attention through the portfolio reviews and trilateral Meetings. While progress is needed across all highrisk areas, nine additional areas require significant attention to address imminent, longstanding, or particularly broad issues affecting the nation. These and other programs can benefit from improving program and project management. These include the acquisition-related areas for the Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as other programs that have long-standing or significant management concerns, such as the 2020 Decennial Census and the National Cybersecurity Strategy. In November 2018, O MB told GAO of plans to hold additional meetings on priority high-level areas, including strategic human capital management, ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation, and managing federal real property.
TSA is responsible for securing the nation's civil aviation system, which includes the screening of all passengers and property transported by commercial passenger aircraft. TSA began using behavior detection in 2006 as an added layer of security to identify potentially high-risk passengers. In 2012, DHS issued a memorandum directing TSA to take a number of actions in response to allegations of profiling by behavior detection officers. GAO was asked to review TSA's use of behavior detection. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which TSA has policies and procedures in place to prevent unlawful profiling, and (2) how TSA ensures that behavior detection screeners are adhering to these policies. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed TSA policies, procedures, and training materials; analyzed complaint data from October 2015 through February 2018; and interviewed TSA officials. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has policies prohibiting unlawful profiling—using race, ethnicity, gender, or other protected characteristics to identify passengers for additional screening—when usingbehavior detection, as well as other screening measures. However, TSA does not have a specific mechanism to monitor whether screeners use behavior detection to unlawfully profile passengers. For example, TSA's 2016 Optimized Behavior Detection Program Handbook and Operational Oversight Compliance Guidance require supervisors to conduct routine checks to monitor compliance with standard operating procedures, but do not specifically instruct supervisors to monitor for compliance with procedures intended to prohibit unlawful profiling. According to TSA officials, this type of monitoring could alert supervisors to situations where unlawful profiling happens and could alert them to potential incidents of profiling. TSA officials also stated that they do not plan to add an oversight mechanism for unlawful profiling because they believe that the training screeners receive, adherence to the standard operating procedure, and general supervisory oversight are sufficient to prevent such profiling. Developing a specific oversight mechanism, such as a checklist or a data-driven study, to monitor screeners' compliance with policies that prohibit unlawful profiling would provide TSA with greater assurance that its personnel are complying with these policies and better position TSA to identify potential incidents. TSA received about 3,700 complaints alleging violations of civil rights and civil liberties and has recommended screener training to address these complaints. The majority (2,251 of 3,663) of the complaints alleged discrimination or profiling based on personal attributes and characteristics. For instance, the TCC received complaints alleging discrimination that involved assertions by passengers that they had been selected for pat-downs based on race and ethnicity when the passengers believed they did not trigger an alarm prompting the pat-down. The TCC also received complaints related to passengers' transgender identity alleging selection for additional security screening because of their transgender status. TSA's Multicultural Branch—the agency's office responsible for collecting, monitoring, and adjudicating passenger complaints alleging civil rights or civil liberties violations at the passenger screening checkpoint, including complaints alleging unlawful profiling and discrimination—reviews complaints referred to it from TSA's Contact Center and other offices. For 1,066 of the 2,059 complaints, the Multicultural branch found indications of potential discrimination and recommended a range of refresher training for screeners to address the complaints. TSA also reported that it took disciplinary actions—from letters of reprimand to termination—for 100 screeners between October 2015 and February 2018, in part, because of passenger complaints.
DOE's EM is responsible for the cleanup of nuclear and hazardous waste at 16 sites across the United States. In recent years, EM's environmental liability has grown annually at a level that has outpaced the department's annual spending on cleanup activities. In January 2019, GAO reported that in fiscal years 2011 through 2018, EM spent over $48 billion, primarily to address radioactive tank waste as well as treat and dispose of other hazardous materials. GAO was asked to testify on the status of EM's cleanup efforts. This testimony is based on GAO's February 2019 report on EM's (1) environmental liability, (2) management of its cleanup program, and (3) information EM has provided to Congress on its cleanup efforts and the extent to which it has complied with statutory reporting requirements. For its February 2019 review of DOE's fiscal year 2018 financial statement, which included a review of the fiscal year 2017 and 2018 budget requests for EM and other DOE programs and contracts, and an analysis of DOE financial data and documents for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and the most recent Future-Years Defense Environmental Management Plan submitted to Congress in August 2017 (see table), GAO reviewed EM's financial statements, interviewed EM officials, and reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. In its 2018 fiscal year financial statement for the Department of Energy (DOE), the department reported an estimated environmental liability of $494 billion and may continue to grow. The majority of this liability was for cleanup work overseen by EM, which accounted for $377 billion (over 75 percent) of the total liability in the financial statement. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) currently estimated liability does not include the costs of all cleanup activities for which the agency will likely be responsible in the future and the cost of addressing some of its largest projects is still underestimated. For example, as of April 2018, DOE and its contractor had still not negotiated a cost for completing the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) construction project, which is the largest and most complex construction project in DOE's history. Further, although EM typically spends about $6 billion per year on cleanup, a large amount of this cleanup budget does not support actual cleanup activities but instead goes toward recurring activities necessary to maintain the sites rather than toward reducing the environmental liability. EM refers to these activities as “minimum safety” work. According to DOE officials, minimum safety work constitutes 30 to 60 percent of individual sites' budgets, for a total of at least $2.7 billion of EM’s fiscal year (FY) 2018 budget. DOE has not yet resolved long-standing management challenges that affect its environmental liability and cleanup program and contracts. In March 2019 GAO found that DOE did not always ensure that contractors audited subcontractors’ incurred costs as required in their contracts, resulting in more than $3.4 billion in subcontract costs incurred over a 10-year period that had not been audited as required, and some subcontracts remained unaudited or unassessed for more than 6 years. In addition, EM has not consistently reported required information about the status and progress of its environmental cleanup program. For instance, in its most recent FY 2018 budget materials, EM did not include all of the information required by law and did not provide the funding it says it needs to meet its cleanup milestones. In February 2019, in response to a recommendation from GAO, DOE agreed to revise its cleanup policy to include program management leading practices for monitoring and controlling the program, including conducting root cause analyses and developing corrective action plans, and has since said it is working toward this goal. However, EM does not have a program-wide strategy that sets priorities and describes how it will address its greatest risks. Instead, according to agency officials, it continues to prioritize and fund cleanup activities by individual site. In a January 2019 report GAO recommended that EM develop a strategy that outlines how EM will direct available resources to address human health and environmental risks across and within sites. DOE agreed with this recommendation and said it was working toward it. In April 2019, DOE reported that it plans to further examine the issues GAO raised in its report.
The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) is responsible for counting the nation's population as of April 1, 2020 (Census Day), delivering state apportionment counts to the President by December 31, 2020, and redistricting data to the states by April1, 2021. The Bureau is charged with counting every person in the decennial census once, only once, and in the right place. To ensure fairness and consistency in where people are counted, for the first decennial in 1790, Congress established the concept of counting people where they usually reside. For 2020, the Bureau plans to use its concept of usual residence and its associated residence criteria to determine where to count people generally as it did in 2010, but in 2018 the Bureau updated its guidance on how to apply that concept to six complex living situations: (1) military and civilian employees of the United States deployed overseas; (2) non-citizens; (3) people in certain types of group facilities on Census Day; (4) people who do not have a usual residence, or who cannot determine one; and (5) those who are counted where they are on Census day. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's plans for counting people in the 2020 Census. In this report, GAO describes the changes the Bureau has made to its residence guidance for 2020 and describes how it plans to resolve incomplete and conflicting information in individual household responses. The Census Bureau provided technical comments on a copy of this draft report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. In addition to updating its usual residence guidance, for 2020 the Bureau also plans to revise its guidance to include information on where it will count people in other complex living conditions, such as people living in group quarters. For example, in 2010 the Bureau did not include in its guidance the status of people living at a group quarters facility because it determined that this population typically does not have usual residence elsewhere. For the 2020 census the Bureau will count this population at the facility, where it counted this population in 2010. In 2010, it counted the group quarters population at their usual home address or, if they had no usual address, then at the facilities. The change was made after the Bureau concluded that this group of people typically had no other usual residence other than their usual residence. According to Bureau officials, the updated guidance will provide greater clarity and result in more informed responses and, thus, higher quality data. Once the Census Bureau has completed its decennial data collection efforts, it generally finds that a small proportion of responses have data quality issues that were not resolved during preceding operations. In these cases, some addresses have multiple responses, some households are missing responses altogether, or some responses include answers that are incomplete or conflict with one another. To address these issues the Bureau uses a technique it refers to as “count imputation” in which it fills in incomplete or conflicting information about a person or household using existing information about the same or other households in the same census response or in prior census or other administrative records. For 2010, for example, about 500,000 of 137 million addresses (0.4 percent) were missing an entire response and the Bureau therefore used count imputation to determine a combination of their residence and occupancy status and household size. In 2020, however, some of the missing responses will instead be resolved through the use of administrative records in conjunction with the Bureau’s door-to-door non-response follow-up effort, thereby reducing the amount of field work needed and the number of households in need of count imputations. Bureau tests and evaluations performed during the preceding decade demonstrate that using administrative records will provide more accurate results than traditional methods of seeking information from neighbors and others or from countimputation alone.
In fiscal years 2013 through 2017, more than 258,000 active-duty servicemembers were disciplined for a violation of the UCMJ. The UCMJ requires the military services to collect and maintain data on the race, ethnicity, and gender of servicemember investigated and disciplined for UCMJ violations. GAO was asked to review racial and gender disparities in the military justice system. This report assesses the extent to which (1) the services collect, maintain, and report data on race and gender in their investigations, military justice, and personnel databases that can be used to assess disparities; and (2) there are such disparities. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed data from the military service databases for all active- duty members of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, and interviewed officials from these services and the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The Department of Defense (DOD) collects and maintains complete data for race and ethnicity in its databases for investigations, courts-martial, and nonjudicial punishments, but does not collect or maintain consistent information about race andethnicity in its military justice or personnel databases. For example, the Coast Guard's military justice database does not have the capability to query or report on gender data, and the Army's and Navy's investigations databases do not include gender data. The Coast Guard does not track information about gender in its investigations database, but the ability to query and report on the gender of its personnel database would provide it with more readily available data to identify or assess any gender disparities that may exist in the investigation and trial of military justice cases. The military services' databases also do not have complete data on nonjudicial punishment cases, and GAO could not determine whether there were racial or gender disparities because these services do not collect complete data. For nonjudicial punished cases, the Army and the Navy do not maintain complete data because they are not required to do so. The Army, the Navy and the Marine Corps maintain complete information in their military justice databases, but they do not keep complete information on all nonjudicial punishments. The absence of complete data limits their visibility into the vast majority of legal punishments imposed on the armed forces and limits their ability to assess or identify disparities among populations subject to this type of punishment. DOD and the services have conducted some assessments of disparities in military justice but have not studied the causes of these disparities. DOD has recently directed the services to, no later than December 23, 2020, collect uniform race and ethnic data in their databases, aggregate any expanded ethnic or racial categories to the categories listed in the standards, collect either the social security number or DOD identification number in the databases, and collect complete summary courts-Martial information. However, the newly issued standards apply only to the militaryJustice databases and not to the investigations and Personnel databases. Further, DOD's annual reports about the number and status of pending military cases do not provide demographic information, such as breakdowns by race or gender, about servicemambers who experienced a military justice action. Reporting this information would provide servicem embers and the public with greater visibility into potential disparities and help build confidence that DOD is committed to a militaryJustice system that is fair and just.
The nation faces many biological threats, including naturally occurring diseases that affect human, animal, and plant health, and biological weapons used by state or nonstate actors, such as anthrax, Ebola, and other emerging infectious diseases such as dengue and chikungunya. GAO's past work has identified five key challenges related to the nation's ability to detect and respond to biological events that transcend what any one agency can address on its own. These include: (1) enterprise-wide threat determination, (2) situational awareness and data integration, (3) biodetection technologies, (4) biological laboratory safety and security, and (5) emerging infectious disease surveillance. The complexity and fragmentation of roles and responsibilities across numerous federal and nonfederal entities presents challenges to ensuring efficiency and effectiveness across the entire biodefense enterprise. In September 2018, the White House issued the National Biodefense Strategy and through NSPM-14 established a governance structure to guide its implementation. The activities and responsibilities assigned to the interagency governance body by the strategy may create new opportunities to make progress on these longstanding and complex issues. However, because implementation of the strategy is in early stages, it remains to be seen how or to what extent they will be able to address these challenges. This testimony is based on prior GAO work issued from October 2017 through May 2018, including selected updates conducted in September 2018 on the status of recommendations GAO made in these prior reports. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC), which was created to integrate data across the federal government with the aim of enhancing detection and situational awareness of biological events, has suffered from long-standing issues related to its clarity of purpose. In 2009, GAO reported that some of NBIC's partners were not convinced of the value that working with NBIC provided because the center's mission was not clearly articulated and that NBIC was not fully equipped to carry out its mission because it lacked key resources—data and personnel—from its partner agencies, which may have been at least partially the result of collaboration challenges it faced. In August 2012, NBIC issued the NBIC Strategic Plan, to provide its strategic vision, clarify the center’s mission and purpose, and articulate the value it seeks to provide to its partners, among other things. In a September 2015 report on the inadvertent shipment of live anthrax into the United States from a laboratory in the Army, we found that the Army had not fully institutionalized measures to ensure that its biological test and evaluation mission remains independent from its biological research and development mission so that its test and evaluate procedures are objective and reliable. In October 2017, we reported that the Federal Select Agent Program—jointly managed by HHS and USDA—oversees laboratories’ handling of certain hazardous pathogens known as select agents, but the program does not fully meet all key elements of effective oversight. For example, the program was not independent from all laboratories it oversees, and it had not assessed risks posed by its current structure or the effectiveness of its mechanisms to reduce organizational conflicts of interest. We made 11 recommendations for the program, including to assess risks and address risks as needed. To date, 5 of 11 recommendations have been addressed and we continue to monitor the progress for the 6 that remain open. In March 2016, we made 33 recommendations to improve the oversight of high-containment laboratories, which conduct research on hazardous pathogens—such as the Ebola virus and the bacteria that causes anthrax—and toxins that may pose a serious threat to humans, animals, or plants. In addition, in August 2016 we reported on safety lapses in high- Containment Laboratory (HLC) oversight of pathogen inactivation, which is the process of removing pathogens from the body after they have been killed or infected. In response to several incidents involving the shipment of improperly inactivated pathogens, we recommended that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and USDA improve their oversight of inactivation by revising reporting forms, improving guidance for development and validation of in activation protocols, and developing consistent criteria for enforcement of incidents involving incomplete inactivation. Todate, 6 of the 11 recommendations were addressed and GAO continues to monitor their implementation.
The Navy plans to begin construction of the lead Columbia class submarine in October 2020. GAO was asked to review the Columbia class program. This report assesses (1) the Navy's progress and challenges, if any, associated with meeting design goals and preparing for lead submarine construction; (2) the reliability of the cost estimate; and (3) how the Navy is implementing the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund and associated authorities to construct Columbia class submarines. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed Navy and shipbuilder officials. The Navy is developing a number of new technologies related to Columbia class propulsion, missile tubes, and survivability that are planned to ensure that the submarine will remain operationally relevant throughout its planned 42.5-year service life. However, several technologies that met GAO's definition of a critical technology element were not identified by the Navy as critical technologies. In addition, several of these were immature, with technology readiness levels (TRL)—used to describe the maturity of critical technologies—of less than 7.0 as of October 2018. The Department of Defense (DOD) estimates that it will need $115 billion to design and construct 12 submarines, including the lead submarine, which is estimated to take 12 million labor hours to construct. This represents 17 percent fewer labor hours than what was needed for the lead Virginia class submarine, when adjusted for weight differences. To develop this estimate, Navy cost estimators relied heavily on historical labor hour data from the construction of Virginia class submarines and cost data for unique ballistic submarine components, such as missiles, to develop the Columbia lead submarine estimate. The cost estimate does not fully meet the criteria for a reliable cost estimate because it is based on overly optimistic labor hour assumptions and does not reflect the likely labor hour costs that the Navy will incur to construct the submarines. For example, the estimate assumes that the shipbuilder will realize efficiencies from initiatives to improve design and construction processes, but GAO found that these initiatives are either unsubstantiated or unprecedented compared to Virginia class and other shipbuilding historical data. If these assumptions are not realized, overall program costs could be higher than the Navy estimates. The Columbia program cost estimate is not credible because it does not adequately account for program risks. For instance, while the Navy conducted risk analyses to test the likelihood of achieving its assumptions, it selected a specific cost estimate that informs the program's budget that does not include any margin in case those assumptions do not be achieved. Further, the cost estimates and assessments conducted by other entities produced a range of results, indicating that there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding program costs. Navy officials stated that they plan to update the Columbia cost estimate in support of DOD's decision to authorize construction of a lead submarine and this decision is expected to occur in summer 2020, but this timeframe does not provide assurance that both the update and the independent assessment will be complete before the Navy requests funding from Congress for lead submarines as part of its fiscal year 2021 budget request, which could be submitted as early as February 2020. If so, decision makers may be basing their decisions on outdated or incomplete information. Since its inception in 2014, Congress has provided the Navy with enhanced acquisition authorities to buy and construct submarines and certain key components early, in bulk, and continuously, when using funds from the National sea-based Deterrence fund and its associated authorities. Using these authorities, the Navy anticipates saving over $1.9 billion through use of the Fund's associated authorities, but these savings may be overestimated because the Navy did not evaluate these savings when it developed the program office cost estimate. Updating the estimate to reflect these savings will provide program management with a more realistic assessment of the margin available and resources needed to achieve their costs.
Four federal land management agencies—the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (Park Service), and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)—are responsible for managing the resources on over 700 million acres of federal lands. These agencies have law enforcement divisions that protect their employees and secure their facilities. GAO was asked to review threats and assaults against federal employees. This report examines, among other things, (1) what is known about the number of threats and assault against land management agency employees, (2) the approaches the agencies used to protect employees and any factors affecting their ability to do so, and (3) the extent to which agencies met facility security assessment requirements. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the four agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for fiscal years 2013 through 2017, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review, reviewed agency policies and procedures, and interviewed agency officials. Available federal law enforcement data show a range of threats, assaults, and other incidents against the employees of the four federal lands management agencies, but not all incidents are captured in the data. For example, BLM data showed 88 incidents of threats or assaults against BLM employees from fiscal year 2013 to 2017 and cited eight different statutes or regulations that may have been violated, such as a federal law prohibiting people from assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain federal officers or employees, 18 U.S.C. § 111, was the statute most frequently cited in BLM's data. Additionally, FBI data on its investigations into potential domestic terror threats to land management officials show a wide variety of statutes and regulations that were potentially violated. However, not all of these incidents are recorded in the agencies' data systems, and some incidents are investigated by state or local law enforcement and recorded in their data systems rather than in agencies' systems. As a result, the actual number of incidents is unclear and may be higher than what is represented in available data. Land management agencies use various approaches to protect federal employees, including building relationships with external law enforcement entities and the public; receiving, collecting, and disseminating intelligence; and offering training to agency employees. Agency officials GAO interviewed cited four factors that can affect agencies' ability to protect workers, including that employees often work in remote locations and interact with the public as part of their official duties, which can put them at risk of being threatened or assaulted. The four federal agencies have not completed facility security assessments on all of their occupied facilities, and three do not have a plan for doing so. The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) Standard requires agencies to assess the risks faced by each of their facilities, including the degree to which undesirable events—such as vandalism, active shooters, and explosive devices—can impact their facilities and the countermeasures they could implement to mitigate the risks of those events. The ISC Standard also requires that agencies conduct facility security reassessments at least once every 3 to 5 years, depending on the facility's security level, to reassess whether existing countermeasures remain adequate for mitigating risks. As of June 2019, BLM, FWS, and the Park Service have not conducted all of the required assessments, and agency officials cited various reasons for not doing so, including limited resources and insufficient training. The Forest Service has conducted assessments on at least 135 of its approximately 1,135 facilities, but officials do not know when they will complete the remaining assessments and have no plan for completing them. In addition, the Forest Service's assessment methodology complies with key requirements in the ISC standard, but BLM and FWS do not. According to agency officials, they do not plan to complete the assessments, in part, because they lack the resources or expertise to conduct the assessments. Without conducting all required assessments and using a methodology that fully meets the Standard's requirements, agencies could face adverse effects, including an inability to make informed resource allocation decisions for their physical security needs and providing facilities—and their occupants—with an inappropriate or insufficient level of protection.
The 340B Program, established in 1992, gives 340B covered entities--nongovernmental hospitals, clinics, and other entities--discounts on covered outpatient drugs comparable to those made available to state Medicaid agencies. To participate in the program, hospitals must have contracts with state or local governments to provide health care services to the 340B-specified low-income population. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for overseeing the program. GAO was asked to review HRSA's oversight of hospitals' participation in the 340 B Program. This report examines (1) the extent to which HRSA processes provide reasonable assurance that participating hospitals meet the program's eligibility requirements, (2) the details of the contracts that hospitals have with state and local governments, and (3) how HRSA verifies hospitals' eligibility to participate. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 240 contracts submitted to HRSA for review in 2017 and 2018 and interviewed HRSA officials. HRSA uses self-reported data to determine whether participating hospitals are nonprofit without assessing whether the data are reliable for that purpose. For example, HRSA relies on Medicare cost report data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on whether hospitals operate as nonprofit, proprietary, or governmental organizations. However, CMS does not have any formal processes to assess the reliability of these data because these data do not affect Medicare reimbursement. Without ensuring that the information it uses on hospitals' nonprofit status is reliable, HR SA cannot effectively determine if nongovernmentally hospitals participating in, or seeking to participate in, the program meet the statutory eligibility requirements. In April 2019, in response to a legislative mandate to review hospitals' compliance with the statutory requirement to have contracts to provide services to low- income individuals, HRSA began conducting quarterly checks of cost report information to identify hospitals that list themselves as proprietary for further review, as this designation could be used by for-profit, rather than nonprofit, hospitals, contrary to the program eligibility requirement. In addition to using Medicare cost reports to verify the existence of government contracts to serve the low-cost population,HRSA relies primarily on nongogovernmental hospitals' self-attestations to verify that they have contracts in place to serve this population, but weaknesses in the reviews of contracts it does conduct hamper the identification of potential eligibility issues. Specifically, while HRSA requires hospitals to have copies of their contracts, and to provide them upon request, it does not require most hospitals to submit those contracts at either registration or recertification. Additionally, although HRSA previously required each hospital to submit a certification of contract form during registration that was signed by a government official and attested to the existance of a contract, officials said the agency stopped requiring submission of this form in July 2014. As a result, the agency no longer has a process that requires government officials to confirm that contracts are in place. HRS does collect and review contracts for a sample of hospitals through its audit and contract integrity check processes, but these reviews are currently limited in number and scope. In fiscal years 2017 and2018, HRsa audited about 7 percent of hospitals per year and conducted contract integrity checks for 20 percent of newly registering hospitals; this equated to 41 hospitals in calendar year 2017 and year 2018 combined. In an August 2019 proposed information collection request, if approved, HRRA would require all newly registering nongoGovernmental hospitals to provide documentation of their state orlocal government contracts at registration, but this requirement would only apply to those hospitals already registered for the program and would not affect those already participating. Without a process to verify hospitals' contracts, which are required by statute and HRSA policy, it is unclear how implementing a verification process would represent a significant burden for nongogovernments already registered with the program or those already seeking to register. The contracts reviewed included few details about the hospitals' obligations to serve low- Income individuals. Of the 240 contracts GAO examined, 224 (93 percent) required the hospitals to serve these individuals, and of these, 169 (75 percent) specifically mentioned providing services to those not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare. Of these 224 contracts, the specific income threshold varied, generally ranging from 100 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.
In June 2018, the administration released its government-wide reform plan, Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century: Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations (reform plan). In July 2019, the Administration reported on the first year of progress toward its reform proposals. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the reform plan. This report examines the extent to which (1) key practices for effective reforms were followed, and (2) agencies identified some legal authorities for implementation. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed OMB, OPM, and GSA officials. The administration has made progress toward four of the five reforms GAO selected for review: moving background investigations from OPM to DOD; solving the cybersecurity workforce shortage; establishing the GEAR Center; and reorganizing OPM. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the General Service Administration (GSA) have generally addressed most of the key practices GAO identified for effective reform. For example, OMB and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have partially addressed key practices related to establishing goals and outcomes, involving employees and key stakeholders, and addressing high-risk areas and longstanding management challenges. However, they have not fully addressed other key practices, such as developing an implementation plan that includes outcome-oriented goals, timelines, key milestones, deliverables, and processes to monitor implementation progress. OMB staff told GAO that they did not have additional information to share regarding their application of key reform practices because they are still developing this reform. As a result, most of GAO's key practices were partially met. OPM provided GAO with documents that demonstrated improvements in this area, but as of November 2019, had yet to finalize a plan for implementing the reform. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018 included provisions that resulted in the transfer of the majority of background investigations conducted by OPM's National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB) to DOD for certain DOD personnel, which represented approximately 70 percent of all federal background investigations performed by NBIB. In January 2019, DOD formally established the Personnel Vetting Transformation Office (PVTO) to implement and oversee activities related to the transfer. In April 2019, President Trump issued Executive Order 13869, which generally provided for transfer of background investigation operations from OMB to DOD. According to the reform proposal, this transfer would provide an opportunity to conduct the background investigations more efficiently and economically than having them be performed by separate agencies. The NDAA for fiscal year 2018 and the executive order established a goal and related requirements for the transfer to DOD of OPM personnel, resources, and functions. The executive order also outlined a series of deliverables and objectives for DOD to achieve during the transfer, including governance, information technology, contracting, and funding background investigations, among others. As of September 30, 2019, more than 99 percent of employees accepted positions transferring them to DOD's Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA). According to DOD, 17 individuals chose not to transfer, and instead retired as permitted.
USIBWC operates two wastewater treatment plants along the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona and California that treat wastewater from both countries. USIBWC and the Mexican Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) have agreed to share the costs of operating and maintaining the plants. GAO was asked to review the operations of these plants. This report examines (1) the status of the two plants, (2) factors that affect the plants' operations and steps IBWC has taken to address them, and (3) the extent to which USIB WC has taken steps to address water quality problems in the two watersheds, including using key capital planning principles. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from USIBWC and other federal, state, and local officials in the United States and Mexico. The Nogales, Arizona, and South Bay, California, wastewater plants operate under the terms of a 1944 treaty with Mexico that establishes IBWC in its current form and addresses the construction, management, and operation of the plants, as well as cost-sharing agreements for the ongoing operation and maintenance of each plant. Under the treaty, IBWC is authorized to jointly study, investigate, and develop solutions to transboundary problems related to water and the international boundary, such as water quality, and to resolve disputes between the two countries arising from the interpretation or application of the treaty. In addition, both sections of IBWC have negotiated minutes laying out the countries' roles and responsibilities in managing and operating the two treatment plants. Under this authority, the two sections have also established cost- Sharing Agreements for the operation and Maintenance of each treatment plant. IBWC and others have taken some actions to address the factors affecting each plant's operation, including initiating an informal binational rapid response team to address breaking and failing wastewater infrastructure along the border. However, IB WC has not taken the necessary steps to formalize this team, and raw sewage continues to periodically spill into the Santa Cruz River Basin and Tijuana River Valley watersheds. The agency has not identified alternatives, cost estimates, funding sources, or time frames for implementing them. The long-standing environmental and health problems associated with stormwater flows in the watersheds of both rivers continue, and no entity has taken action to identify alternatives to address these problems. In particular, while USIBwC has conducted some feasibility studies on different individual solutions, it has not done a comprehensive study to recommend any overall solutions to address stormwater problems of bacteria, trash, and sediment in either watershed. In 2019, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a Capital Programming Guide, which provides guidance on capital planning, including key planning principles, that would help identify alternative approaches to addressing stormwater issues in the Santa Santa Cruz or Tijuana rivers. In 2017, OMB issued a memorandum to federal agencies that reinforced the need to implement capital programming guidance in OMB Circular A-11 that agencies develop, document, and implement a capital planning process. OMB's guidance requires long-range capital planning and a disciplined decision-making process as the basis for managing assets to achieve an agency's goals and objectives.
Reverse mortgages are a nonrecourse loan against home equity that does not require mortgage payments as long as the borrower meets certain conditions. FHA administers the HECM program, which allows borrowers to tap a portion of their home equity to supplement their retirement income. GAO was asked to review issues related to reverse mortgages. This report examines (1) what FHA data show about HECMs' loan terminations, servicer advances, and foreclosure prevention options; (2) FHA's assessment and monitoring of HECm performance, servicicer advances and prevention options, and how FHA and CFPB collect, analyze, and analyze these data; and (3) how CFP B and FHA collect and analyze consumer complaint data about reverse mortgages and the extent to which they share and use the other agency's data. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FHA loan data for fiscal years 2014 through 2018, reviewed FHA policies and procedures, and interviewed FHA, HUD, and CSPB officials. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and overseen by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). GAO found that about 272,155 loans were terminated by FHA in fiscal year 2018. Death of the borrower was the most common reason for termination, followed by borrower defaults. However, borrower defaults have increased in recent years. For example, in 2018, about 18 percent of all terminations (approximately 60,000 loans) were due to borrower defaults, up from 2 percent in 2014. The number of borrowers who have defaulted on their H ECMs and faced foreclosure has also increased, and the percentage of borrowers with delinquent property charges has increased. For borrowers who defaulted, FHA generally requires the servicer to pay the property charges on the borrower's home to help avoid a tax foreclosure by the local authority and protect the investor's home. In some cases, servicers can also charge certain fees once a loan is called due and payable, which are typically amounts related to attorney or trustee fees, property preservation fees, and appraisal fees during the foreclosure process. The payments and fees that servicers make on behalf of borrowers—referred to asservicer advances—are added to the loan balance and accrue interest. Servicers can file a claim with FHA for the difference if the lender experiences financial difficulty or if the borrower or heir sells the home to repay the loan, but borrowers are not responsible for any amount above the value of the home at the end of the loan or for any other costs. In addition, borrowers who are unable to pay their property charges are generally allowed to sell the home and use some or all of the proceeds to pay off the loan. For fiscal years 2015 through 2018 (the most recent years for which complete data are available), FHA approved roughly 70 percent of the 1,013 mortgagee optional election assignments that H ECM servicers submitted from June 2015 through September 30, 2018, and denied the remaining 30 percent (432). FHA provided information indicating that as of May 31, 2019, 79 percent (342) of the associated loans had not terminated; 14 percent (62 loans) had been paid off; and the remaining 7 percent (22 loans) ended in foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or short sale. For those that had terminated, the debt was paid off or was satisfied because of a foreclosure, short sale, or other reasons, such as a borrower's death or moving or conveying title to someone else. For about 30 percent of these loans, however, it was not possible to readily determine a termination reason because FHA does not regularly track and report on these reasons. Without comprehensive and accurate data on loan outcomes, it is difficult to know how well the program is working to help seniors age in place. While FHA has taken steps to improve the performance of the program, it has not incorporated key elements of performance assessment—such as performance indicators and recent program evaluations—into its management of the HRCM program. For instance, the last comprehensive program evaluation was completed 19 years ago. Without performance indicators or recent evaluations, it will be difficult for FHA to assess the program's performance and make informed decisions about any needed changes in the future.
The attempted attack of December 25, 2009, highlighted the unknown threats to U.S. civil aviation. TSA has created the Silent Partner and Quiet Skies Lists to help address these unknown threats by ensuring that certain potentially higher risk passengers receive enhanced screening when traveling to, from, or within the United States. The TSA Modernization Act requires TSA I&A to identify and review its screening rules every 120 days, in coordination with DHS and TSA stakeholders, and to provide notification to these stakeholders no later than two days after making a change to a rule. GAO was asked to review TSA's oversight of the Quiet Skies and Silent Partner programs. This report examines (1) the extent to which TSA has coordinated with stakeholders to review screening rules, and (2) how TSA tracks and assesses the effectiveness of the rules. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials. The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Office of Information and Administrative Affairs (I&A) has coordinated quarterly rule review meetings with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other TSA stakeholders as required by the Transportation Security Modernization and Reform Act of 2002, but TSA guidance is not clear about the criteria for review of rule changes. Pursuant to the Act, TSA is to identify, review, and notify DHS and other stakeholders of any changes to screening rules at least 120 days—or at least three times a year—after making a rule change. TSA officials stated that they plan to continue convening quarterly review meetings because, given the difficulty of scheduling these large meetings, it will help them ensure they meet the 120 day requirement. In addition, since October 2018, TSA has also included representatives of DHS's Traveler Redress Inquiry Program and the Federal Air Marshal Service in these quarterly review Meetings, as required, and officials from these offices told GAO in August 2019 that they are still determining their role in the rule review process, but expect the coordination to be beneficial. However, TSA does not document which review process it uses (exigent or standard) for each new rule or rule change in its Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The lack of clear SOPs inhibits program oversight. By establishing clear criteria for and documentation of each process, TSA could increase transparency and ensure rule changes are reviewed as intended. TSA tracks some data on passenger screening rule implementation, but has not comprehensively assessed effectiveness. TSA monitors some operational data on its passenger screening rules. For example, TSA tracks the number of passengers on the Silent partner and Quiet skies lists, and the rules triggered by the passengers' travel. TSA's April 2012 Quiet Skies Implementation Plan established that TSA would continually evaluate the performance of the program's rules. TSA also monitors the list size and number of rule matches, which allow it to monitor for Secure Flight system errors, but it has not identified a means to comprehensively measure rule effectiveness. Given the TSA resources being devoted to the enhanced screening and in-flight monitoring of many passengers matching the lists, it is important that TSA understand the value of its screening rule programs. Exploring additional data sources—such as checkpoint screening results and after-action reports—could help TSA refine and supplement their existing efforts to measure program effectiveness.
FDA reviews new drug applications (NDA) for drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions, such as cancer or rare diseases, to determine whether they qualify for one or more expedited programs, which can help reduce the development or review time needed to bring a drug to market. GAO was asked to review FDA's processes for reviewing NDAs. This report examines (1) how FDA divisions differ in the proportion of NDAs they review with key features linked to time frames for initial review, and (2) the extent to which NDAs' key features contribute to differences between divisions in the time taken to complete initial reviews. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FDA data on NDAs submitted from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed FDA officials about the data and their review processes. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) divisions differed in the total number of days they took to complete reviews of 637 new drug application (Nda) submitted in fiscal year 2018 and completed by March 31, 2019. These review times reflect differences associated with the number of completed review cycles, FDA's target timeframes for review under its goals in commitment letters associated with its Prescription Drug User Fee Act reauthorizations for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 (PDUFA V) and fiscal years 2018 through 2022 (PD UFA VI). FDA's PDUFA goals are linked to three key features of the NDA: whether the application received priority review designation (a designation applied by FDA if the product would provide a significant therapeutic improvement in the safety and effectiveness of the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a serious condition when compared to available drugs) or instead had a standard designation; whether the applicant submitted a major amendment (a submission, while a pending NDA is under FDA review, of additional information that may include a major new clinical safety or efficacy study report or major new analyses of studies, among other things); and whether or not the application qualified for an expedited program (accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation, or fast track designation). GAO's analysis of the 637 NDAs reviewed by FDA's CDER divisions showed that they differed in their review times for these key features. For example, the anti-infective division took about 2 months longer to complete an initial review of an NDA than the gastroenterology and inborn errors division, while the dermatology and dental division took less than 1 month. These differences in initial review times largely reflected key features associated with FDA's time frames under its PD UFA goals, particularly those linked to the time frame for review of the application under FDA's goals. FDA has several initiatives underway to evaluate and facilitate FDA review divisions' and drug sponsors' use of evidence derived from sources other than traditional clinical trials to support new drug approvals. According to FDA officials, implementing these initiatives can help ensure that when drug sponsors utilize these sources of evidence in NDAs, the evidence is of sufficient quality to be used in regulatory decision-making and that there is consistency across FDA's review divisions in their evaluation of the evidence. FDA's initiatives include conducting public workshops with key stakeholders, issuing guidance for industry and FDA staff, initiating pilot programs, and developing FDA staff capacity, including by providing training and other educational resources. These and future planned activities—including issuing additional guidance and revising relevant FDA policies and procedures—are intended to address deliverables for FDA to accomplish through 2021 that are outlined in the Cures Act and the PDU FA VI commitment letter. According, according to agency officials, the agency intends to meet these deliverables, though according to these officials, some of the activities implemented under the initiatives will likely extend beyond 2021. FDA provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate.
Federal agencies are dependent on information technology (IT) systems and electronic data to carry out operations and to process, maintain, and report essential information. These systems are highly complex and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed. However, the IT systems supporting federal agencies and our nation's critical infrastructures are at risk. In fiscal year 2017, federal executive branch civilian agencies reported 35,277 incidents to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, including web-based attacks, phishing, and the loss or theft of computing equipment. These incidents and others like them can pose a serious challenge to economic and national security and personal privacy. GAO was asked to review federal cybersecurity risk management. This report examines (1) the extent to which agencies established key elements of a cybersecurityrisk management program; (2) what challenges, if any, agencies identified in developing and implementing programs; and (3) what steps the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have taken to meet their risk management responsibilities under Executive Order (EO) 13800 and to address any challenges agencies face in implementing cybersecurity risk Management practices. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed policies and procedures at 23 civilian Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies and interviewed agency officials. The 23 civilian CFO Act agencies—the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Justice, Interior, Labor, Interior (Interior), Labor, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the General Services Administration (GSA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the Small Business Administration (SBA)— varied in the extent that they had established key components of their cybersecurity risk programs. Specifically, 22 of the 23 agencies established the role of cybersecurity risk executive, and most of the agencies had established policies that include elements to ensure their activities are guided by risk-based decisions. For example, 22 agencies established a risk executive to provide agency-wide oversight of risk management activities, and 12 agencies developed processes for aggregating system-level data and analyzing them to assess overall cybersecurity risk to agency operations and assets. The remaining 11 agencies did not develop a process for assessing cybersecurity risks at the agency level. In addition, 5 agencies had developed cybersecurity risk strategies, but these strategies did not address certain required elements, such as a statement of risk tolerance or acceptable risk mitigation strategies. The agencies identified a variety of challenges in establishing and implementing risk management programs, including challenges related to hiring and retaining qualified personnel, managing competing priorities between cybersecurity and agency mission or operations, and implementing consistent cybersecurity risk procedures. In accordance with a recent executive order, OMB and DHS took steps to assess agencies' cybersecurity management capabilities and identified core actions to be taken, in coordination with agencies, to address cybersecurity risks across the executive branch. OMB has stated that an effective enterprise risk management program promotes a common understanding for recognizing and describing potential risks that can impact an agency's mission and the delivery of services to the public. Such risks include strategic, market, cyber, legal, reputational, political, and a broad range of operational risks. If agencies do not successfully integrate cyber risks into their enterprise risk programs, they may be hindered in making effective decisions about addressing cybersecurity risks in the context of other risks and their potential impact on agency missions. In May 2018, in response to EO 13800 on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, O MB and DHS determined that 74 percent of the federal agencies participating in the risk assessment process had cybersecurity programs that were either "at risk" or "high risk." The report also described OMB's plans to work with DHS and other federal entities to implement these actions and reduce cybersecurity risks. Accordingly, several of these initiatives should help address some of the challenges identified by the agencies in GAO's review in establishing cybersecurity riskmanagement programs. For instance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and OMB are developing and disseminating a framework to enable consistent characterization and categorization of cyber threat events across the federal government, and DHS is developing a solution that will be available by the end of December 2019 to foster the adoption of the framework.
FDA is responsible for overseeing the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs, which are drugs that have not yet been shown to be safe and effective in humans through clinical trials. Patients who are unable to participate in a clinical trial may be eligible to obtain access to an investigational drug outside of clinical trials through FDA's expanded access program, through the federal RTT Act, or through a physician's request to the manufacturer. GAO was asked to review FDA's efforts to facilitate access to drugs outside of the clinical trial process. This report examines (1) recent actions FDA has taken to facilitate patient access to investigational Drugs outside of Clinical Trials and (2) the extent to which selected drug manufacturers have communicated to patients and physicians whether they would consider individual requests for access to their drugs. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, guidance, and documents and interviewed officials from FDA and 10 drug manufacturers selected to represent a range of sizes and types of drug manufacturers. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken several recent actions to facilitate the access of patients to investigatory drugs that are not yet approved for use in clinical trials outside of trials. For example, in October 2017, in response to a recommendation in GAO's July 2017 report, FDA clarified its guidance for drug manufacturers on how the agency reviews adverse events that occur under the expanded access process. In addition, in June 2019, FDA launched a pilot program for oncologists and other health care professionals that treat patients with cancer to further simplify its process for individual patient requests. FDA also issued guidance in March 2019 to help drug manufacturers broaden clinical trial eligibility criteria for drugs that treat cancer to include certain patient populations that have typically been excluded from participation, such as children and patients with compromised liver and kidney function. FDA has also increased communication about the expanded Access Program and the federal Research and Treatment Facilities Transfer (RTT) Act by creating separate web pages for patients, physicians, and drug manufacturers, and adding a new web page with information that is commonly requested by physicians and patients, and by clarifying its guidance on how it will use adverse event data from expanded access use when reviewing drugs and biologics for approval. FDA's updated guidance states that FDA is not aware of instances in which adverse event information prevented the agency from approving a drug, and that it is very rare for FDA to place a clinical hold on an investigatory drug due to adverse events observed during expanded access treatment. In May 2019 FDA clarified on its web page that its role includes posting a consolidated annual summary report on the use of drugs through the RTT pathway. Most of the 29 drug manufacturers GAO selected for review used their websites to communicate whether they consider requests to patients for access and the conditions under which they would review requests and grant access. Among those that would consider requests, 19 of the 23 manufacturers stated they were willing to consider requests. The remaining six manufacturers did not communicate this information at the time of our review, but officials from all six told us they were in the process of developing content on this topic that they intended to post on their websites.
In fiscal year 2018, OJJDP made 295 awards totaling over $290 million to support programs intended to ensure youth are held appropriately accountable and empower youth to live productive lives. GAO was asked to review the oversight of the Title II Formula Grant Program, which provides formula grants to states to develop programs for juveniles and improve their juvenile justice systems. The Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 included a provision for GAO to review OJJ DP's performance. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which OJJD has established goals and measures to assess the performance of individual programs, and (2) how the Department of Justice (DOJ) considers fraud risk in its grant monitoring and compliance auditing efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed performance data from October 2015 through December 2018, the latest full calendar year for which data were available at the time of GAO's review, and interviewed officials from DOJ, the Office of Juvenile justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), and the DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG). GAO also reviewed relevant federal standards and guidance and interviewed grantees. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provide insights into grantee-submitted performance data. The Office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention (O JJDP) has established goal statements and performance measures for individual programs and has designated 15 of its measures as “core” measures that are generally applicable across most programs. However, it has not set program-level targets, which limits its ability to assess progress toward program goals. Tracking performance measures against established numeric targets is a leading practice in performance management because it establishes standards against which federal programs can measure progress towards goals because comparisons can be easily made between projected performance and actual results. For example, one stated program goal is to prevent youth already in the juvenile justice system from reoffending; however, the annual performance reports for this program do not provide a target against which to evaluate whether the result reflects progress toward the stated goal. Further, while O JJDP has set several office-wide targets for all programs collectively, these targets may not be appropriate for assessing the progress of the individual programs because programs vary in size. For instance, the Gang Prevention Program served about 1,000 youth in calendar year 2018 compared to the 100,000-plus youth served in fiscal year 2017. Thus, these office- level targets, while useful, may be more representative of program performance and obscure the results of individual program performance. OJJCP officials said that they have not set targets for two reasons. First, there was uncertainty about whether they had the authority to do so (versus OJP's Office of the Chief Financial Officer). Second, setting such targets has not been a priority in the past, in part, due to a lack of resources. In October 2019, OJP clarified that the Administrator has authority for setting performance measurement, including setting program- level and office- Level targets. In addition, while DOJ has taken steps to consider fraud risk for all DOJ grants, including its grant programs, the department has not determined a fraud risk tolerance for any of its grants, as recommended by leading practices of the Fraud Risk Framework, which is a comprehensive set of leading practices for fraud risk management. DOJ officials stated that they did not yet define a risk tolerance because they view it as the next step in the maturation of DOJ's fraud risk assessment processes, but did not provide details or documentation of their plans to develop a specific and measurable fraud riskolerance for the next iteration of their fraud risk assessments. According to officials, DOJ is in the process of awarding a contract that will result in an implementation plan for addressing fraud risk Management requirements in the future. Because neither the award nor the task orders were in place when GAO conducted its review, GAOs cannot determine whether DOJ's planned efforts will fully align with the leading practices.
The Department of Defense's (DOD) consolidated financial statements are a critical component of the U.S. government's consolidated financial reporting system, which is used to help ensure that the government's financial information is reliable and accurate. GAO was asked to review DOD's accounting adjustments. This report examines (1) accounting adjustments and their effect on the reliability of DOD's financial data, (2) the extent to which DOD has established and implemented policies and procedures for recording accounting adjustments, and (3) how DOD has taken actions to reduce accounting adjustments recorded at the consolidated level. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD's policies, procedures, and internal controls over its accounting adjustment processes and performed tests of controls on a random sample of 242 accounting adjustments from a population of 200,468 adjustments that impacted the financial statements for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) recorded over 200,000 accounting adjustments in DOD's core financial reporting systems in fiscal year2018. These adjustments were recorded in the Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS)—Budgetary, DDRS—Audited Financial Statements, and DDRS-AFS Beginning Balance Adjustment modules. The large volume of these adjustments is one of the major impediments to DOD maintaining accurate and reliable financial information. While some adjustments are expected in the routine course of business, others—such as those DFAS records in order to force account balances to match (forced-balance adjustments)—are not. The recording of these types of adjustments was identified as a material weakness in DODs internal control over financial reporting in its fiscal year 2019 financial statement audit. While DOD is taking steps to address this issue, because of the multitude of contributing factors involved, DOD faces significant challenges in its effort to successfully reconcile its account balances with the Department of the Treasury and eliminate the need for recording these adjustments. DOD and DFAS have established multiple initiatives over the last few years to reduce the number of accounting adjustments; however, neither DOD nor DFAS has developed procedures for implementing a department-wide strategy to do so. For example, DFAS issued a bimonthly Strategy Update in November 2017 that included goals for reducing accounting adjustments but did not provide clear direction to staff on how to achieve these goals. In addition, neither DFAS's Strategic Plan nor Business Plan included defined outcomes or clear procedures for accomplishing the stated goals. As a result, there is an increased risk that DFAS and DOD will not be able to produce reliable and auditable consolidated financial statement information in the future. Establishing clear policies and Procedures for Recording Accounting Adjustments. DOD does not have clear policies or procedures for ensuring that accounting adjustments are properly recorded and adequately supported with documentation; identifying the underlying causes for the recording of adjustments; and developing, implementing, and monitoring action plans to address the identified causes. Without such procedures, it is likely that DOD will continue to record inaccurate, invalid, or unapproved adjustments, which could result in misstatements in its consolidated financial reports. DOD has identified some key causes of the long-standing challenges in reconciling account balances, such as timing issues, limitations in the source-level accounting systems that DOD components use, or legacy systems that different DOD components used. DOD is currently implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in the military services and has a plan for implementing ERP systems at smaller DOD components that also use legacy systems. However, the challenges that legacy systems cause are likely to continue until the ERP transitions are completed, at which point DOD expects the need to record forced- balance adjustments to decrease.
The federal government's Reduce the Footprint (RTF) policy is intended to promote the more efficient use of real property assets through improved space utilization and reduction. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) provide leadership in managing federal real property. GAO was asked to review agencies' office space decisions. This report discusses: (1) the extent to which RTF performance measures reflect changes in civilian Chief Financial Officers Act agencies' (CFO Act agencies) office space costs, and (2) how selected agencies considered costs in office space decision-making. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed federal data on office space square footage and costs, reviewed GSA's and OMB's cost performance measures, and interviewed officials from five agencies—the Departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). GAO selected these agencies based on factors such as office space portfolio size, whether the agencies obtain office space themselves or through GSA, and changes in portfolio cost and square footage. To gain insights into how these agencies consider costs when making office space choices, we also selected 13 office space projects these agencies undertook from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2018. The projects are not representative of all projects or agencies and are not generalizable to all agencies. The Department of Defense was excluded from GAO's review because of GSA concerns about the reliability of DOD's data. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) and Occupancy Agreement data GAO reviewed show that the federal government reduced more than 6 million square feet of office space from fiscal years 2015 through 2018, the most recent year for which data were available. However, some agencies' space reductions have slowed as the RTF policy approaches its end date in fiscal year 2020 and as according to OMB officials, many of the lower-cost, high-financial return projects have been executed. GSA tracks and reports two RTF cost measures—estimated cost avoidance and average cost per square foot. These measures provide useful information on agencies' results but do not use the most accurate information. The estimated cost avoidance measure reflects overall federal cost avoidance because it accounts for space that agencies have returned to GSA but that remains unoccupied. Under certain conditions, agencies may vacate GSA-managed space prior to the end of their occupancy agreement and report that as a reduction in their space, but until this space is reoccupied or GSA disposes of it, the federalgovernment continues to incur costs to operate and maintain the space. Because of these continued costs, GSA accounts for vacant space when it estimates cost avoidance. For example, for fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017, the amount of vacant GSA managed office space increased more than the amount agencies reduced. Since this increase meant that the government had not reduced office space overall when the calculation was made, the GSA estimated that rather than avoiding costs, costs for civilian office space had increased by roughly three-quarters of a million dollars during this period. The average costs per square feet measure does not use accurate cost information because it does not account for all agencies' actual costs for office space and does not capture fluctuations in agencies' or vacant federal space throughout the year. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) and Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) method for calculating average costs for GSA manages office space understated these costs by an average of $1.31 (4.7 percent) on average on average over the last 5 years (FY 2015 through FY 2018). GSA officials said that they did not use readily available data on the actual annual costs agencies paid for space each year because GSA did not want to skew the averages toward zero- or low-cost office spaces. In addition, using an inaccurate cost performance measure affects stakeholders' and policymakers' ability to accurately judge and oversee agencies' progress toward reducing space costs. As the government's principal landlord of federal property, the General Service Administration's Public Buildings Service (PBS) emphasizes cost savings from a government-wide perspective when working with agencies. To facilitate this approach, PBS generally begins planning and cost analysis 5 years ahead of expiring occupancy agreements and leases. As part of this planning, PBS analyzes project costs and cost savings, and considers opportunities to fill vacant space and improve a space's efficiency by, for example
GAO was asked to review federal agencies' warehouses and property management. GAO examined: (1) what is known about property in selected agencies warehouses and how much they spend to store this property and (2) the extent to which selected agencies assess the ongoing need for property stored in warehouses. To address these objectives, GAO selected three agenciesthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Office of Science within the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) within the Departments of Justice and Transportationbased on fiscal year 2017 Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) data, among other factors. These three agencies had a total of 1,221 warehouses, with over 6.4-million square feet, that contained a broad array of property. Although comprehensive data on the types of property in these warehouses were unavailable, interviews, site visits, and agencies' data on warehouses themselves provided some information on the property in them. The agencies had some commonalities in the contents of their warehouses. For example, all three had warehouses that contained material-handling equipment, such as fork lifts, as well as excess property being processed for disposal. However, much of the property was specific to their missions, according to agency officials and GAOs observations. All three agencies tracked certain direct costs for owned and leased warehouses, including operations and maintenance costs for some leased warehouses and rental costs for leased warehouses. Although the agencies had this cost information, they did not use it to systematically determine how much it costs to store their property in warehouses, whether at an aggregate or per-item level. Two features of how these agencies track property and warehouse costs would make it difficult to do so. First, the agencies did not have comprehensive information on items in warehouses that would be needed to determine per- item storage costs. Second, selected agencies generally incurred direct costsrent, operations costs, and maintenanceat a warehouse level. Third, agencies generally did not track indirect costs such as personnel costs for conducting regular inventories and other administrative costs associated with storing property in their warehouses, which would be difficult to ascertain what percentage of costs would be allocated to storage versus these other uses. Two of the three agencies GAO reviewed had policies in place explaining the frequency in which property custodians should assess property for ongoing need, but none had guidance on how to assess most items for ongoing needs. The Office of science and BOP had policies that called for identifying unneeded property beyond the statutory requirement to continually survey property to identify excess. In contrast, FAA policy does not set any timeframe for property custodian assessments of ongoing need. The General Services Administration (GSA) is in the process of developing informal guidance on minimizing and identifying excess property to meet this requirement because FPPMA did not provide GSA additional authority to issue regulations or formal guidance. In particular, GSA developed draft guidance, which incorporated principles from a new ASTM standard on identifying and reducing excess property that GSA officials expect will be issued in early 2020, and provided it to ICPM participants for review and comment in September 2019. The draft guidance encourages agencies to designate an individual to manage an agency’s asset management program and use that system to capture and provide information on property age, condition, utilization, and mission dependency on a real-time basis, among others. The guidance also included some criteria agencies could use to assess property use and ongoing need but did not include specific approaches or practices for assessing property utilization, including the use of data analytics and utilization reviews, which could assist agencies in fulfilling their Federal Property Management Management Act requirements.
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) policies require that all licensed health care providers must be credentialed before they are permitted to work in the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) health care system. GAO was asked to review VHA's processes for credentialing and privileging providers. Privileging is a process through which a provider is permitted by a facility to independently provide medical or patient care that is in alignment with the provider's clinical competence. In November 2017, GAO reported that VHA lacked reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to the National Provider Database Board (NPDB) and state licensing boards were reported and that VA medical centers did not always conduct timely reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns were raised about their care. This testimony summarizes the findings of GAO's November 2017 report (GAO-18-63 ) and February 2019 report (VA Health Care: Improved Oversight Needed for Reviewing and Reporting Providers for Quality and Safety Concerns , GAO-2018-260T ). GAO found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VHA medical centers GAO reviewed had only reported one of nine providers to the NPDB as required by VHA policy. Furthermore, none of these nine providers were reported to state licensing board as required. These nine providers either had adverse privileging actions taken against them or resigned or retired while under investigation before an adverse privilege could be taken. For example, one of these providers was terminated for cause related to patient abuse after only 2 weeks of work at the VA medical center. In addition, two of the five medical centers reported one provider to the state licensing Board for failing to meet generally accepted standards of clinical practice to the point that it raised concerns for the safety of veterans. In both of these cases, the boards were not alerted to concerns about the providers' care until after the providers had already been terminated or had their privileges revoked. In a review of 57 providers selected for a February 2019 GAO report on VA health care, the responsible VA medical Centers took action against some of the 57 providers with disqualifying information in the N PDB but overlooked others. Specifically, the centers took administrative or disciplinary actions against some providers, such as removing them from patient care, after becoming aware of adverse information. However, many of these actions were taken following GAO inquiries and a VHA-wide licensure review, both of which occurred in 2018, rather than at the time of the NSDB report. For instance, one medical center removed a provider who had surrendered a license in 2014, while employed at VA, but was not removed by the medical center until after GAO made inquiries in 2018. Additionally, another medical center reported a provider for prescribing controlled substances without appropriate registration to the Drug Enforcement Administration. In its review of 148 providers' required reviews of their clinical care from 2013 to March 2017 at five selected VA medical facilities, the VA found that for almost half of these reviews, officials at these medical centers could not provide documentation to show that the reviews had been conducted. In some cases, these required reviews were not conducted at all. VA officials stated that these types of reviews are not routinely conducted because they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. VA medical Center officials lack the information they need to make decisions about providers' privileges, including whether or not to take adverse privileged actions against providers. In February 2019, in a follow-up review of providers who were disqualified from employment because of adverse licensure actions, VA medicalCenter officials did not consistently adhere to VHA policies that disqualify providers from employment. Three factors were largely responsible for inconsistent adherence to these policies: (1) some medical center officials are not aware of key policies, (2) gaps in policy allow for inconsistent interpretation, and (3) VHA has not issued policies pertaining to employing providers who have had their DEA registration revoked or surrendered for cause. VA concurred with the recommendations in this report and has taken steps to address them.
DOD's policy is to ensure that eligible personnel and their families have access to affordable, quality housing facilities and services consistent with their grade and dependent status, and that the housing generally reflects contemporary community living standards. The military departments have entered into a series of agreements with private partners to provide housing to servicemembers and their family members through privatized family housing projects. In fiscal year 2017, 14 private partners were responsible for 79 privatized housing projects—34 for the Army, 32 for the Air Force, and 13 for the Navy and Marine Corps—in the United States, each of which includes housing at one or more military installations. GAO was asked to review DOD's oversight of privatized military housing. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which DOD conducts oversight of the condition of the privatized units, (2) DOD's monitoring of private partner performance, and (3) DOD and private partner efforts to improve the quality of the housing. The statement is based on GAO's ongoing review of DOD's privatization of military family housing and preliminary observations from a review of the initial data provided by the private partners. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the military departments' oversight has been limited in key areas. For example, GAO found that the scope of oversight of physical condition of private housing is limited, performance metrics focused on quality of maintenance and resident satisfaction may not provide meaningful information on the condition, there is a lack of reliable or consistent data, and past DOD reports to Congress on resident satisfaction are unreliable due to inconsistent handling and calculation of the data and therefore may be misleading. DOD delegates oversight responsibilities of the individual privatized projects to each military department, and each department has subsequently issued guidance outlining oversight roles and responsibilities. Military department oversight activities generally fall into two categories—daily oversight of management and operations and reviews of compliance with each project's business agreements. According to military department officials, each department is currently taking steps to revise guidance and standardize daily oversight activities in an effort to provide consistent oversight across projects and installations, and to increase the focus of oversight on the physical conditions of housing. Each military department is working to implement service-specific initiatives with only limited guidance from OSD on the level of oversight expected of the services as it relates to the conditions of the private housing. While existing OSD guidance provides objectives for oversight of DOD-owned housing, it is focused on the implementation of projects, construction of new housing units, and financial management. The guidance does not include objectives focused on both ensuring the operation and maintenance of private-sector-operated housing to standards that provide safe living conditions and providing authorities to installation commanders to oversee those standards. DOD uses a range of project-specific performance metrics, such as resident satisfaction and maintenance management, to monitor the performance of private partners, but these metrics may not reflect the actual condition of housing units. For instance, one indicator of resident satisfaction is whether a project has met the target occupancy rates established in the business agreements, but residents in our 15 focus groups indicated a variety of reasons for choosing to live in private housing, many of which did not have to do with their satisfaction with the quality or condition of their homes. In October 2019, OSD issued new guidance standardizing the performance incentive fee framework, which provides a framework where the metrics for resident satisfaction will account for a majority of the fee, with project safety and financial performance weighted less heavily. However, according to officials from DOD and military departments, the specific indicators used to drive the metrics will need to be negotiated with each private partner for each project. The Department of Defense and private partners have identified and begun collaborating on initiatives aimed at improving residents' experiences with private housing but may face challenges. These initiatives include the development of a Resident Bill of Rights, a common tenant lease, a resident advocate position, a standardized adjudication process, and a common dispute resolution process.
The platform economy is a growing sector of the U.S. workforce that includes workers who provide goods or services to customers through an online platform operated by a company that facilitates the match, transaction, and payment. These companies can be divided into marketplaces for services or goods and can be further divided into two types of services--transportation or other services and retail or short-term rental--or into two different types of goods--property or parking spaces. GAO was asked to review issues related to platform workers and tax compliance. This report (1) examines what is known about the platform workforce and what can be done to improve the available IRS data, (2) identifies challenges platform workers face complying with federal tax obligations, (3) assesses IRS actions to promote tax compliance among this population, and (4) evaluates additional options to promote compliance. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant literature and IRS documents, interviewed IRS officials and other stakeholders, and reviewed available data on the number of platform workers. The population of workers in the platform economy, referred to by different names, is difficult to count, due in part to the variation in terms and definitions used to describe these workers such as gig, on-demand, sharing economy, contingent, and freelance, among others. As a result of these and other barriers, efforts to measure the size of this workforce through household surveys or administrative data have produced estimates that lack certainty; these estimates of the workforce size generally have ranged from 1.5 million to 2 million for recent years and suggest that the workforce may be growing. For example, in 2017, the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collected data on alternative employment. BLS's survey found there are an estimated 1.6 million “electronically-mediated workers,” defined as those obtaining work through mobile apps and websites that connect workers with customers and arrange payment. However, in January 2019 GAO reported that several factors may have contributed to an undercount of these workers, such as survey questions that may not have captured individuals who engage in platform work on a part-time or sporadic basis. In response to a February 2019 recommendation by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) formed a team of officials from across the agency to develop a strategy to help platform workers comply with their tax obligations. As part of the strategy, IRS developed a communications plan that includes a redesign of IRS web pages, outreach activities to the workers, and a review of IRS guidance and related forms or instructions. The communications plan also includes a goal to solicit feedback on its communication efforts and products tailored for platform workers, but lacks details about how IRS will monitor feedback. According to federal standards for internal control, management should monitor activities and periodically evaluate the quality of information received to achieve its objective. Without a process to monitor feedback, IRS may miss opportunities to find better ways to drive platform workers toward the redesigned web pages or to ensure the redesigned pages are meeting their needs. IRS identified changes to forms, guidance, and other publications that could make it easier for workers to understand which forms apply to them, but it has not yet taken actions such as adding plain language to instructions and publications that clearly indicates when a form applies to a platform worker. IRS could also help ease taxpayer burden by taking steps to increase information reporting for these workers. Platform companies that act as third party settlement organizations (TPSO) do not have to report income information on many workers because reporting thresholds are much higher than what most workers earn. Amending IRS rules to require such reporting at lower thresholds would provide workers with more information to comply with tax obligations and would give IRS additional information to support enforcement efforts. In addition to amending the tie-breaker rule, IRS could work with Treasury to implement voluntary withholding that is voluntary for companies making payments for services to workers who choose to participate.
Passenger assaults on airline customer service agents have been a long-standing problem in the aviation industry, particularly in recent years. These incidents can include verbal threats, physical assaults, and other harmful actions. GAO was asked to review passenger assaults at airports. This report examines (1) the extent to which passengers have physically assaulted airline customers in the past year, and (2) selected stakeholders' perspectives on the extent of passenger assaults. To address these objectives, GAO surveyed a non-generalizable sample of 104 randomly selected customer service agent selected from six selected airlines, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed representatives from selected airports, law enforcement agencies, and airport and airline unions. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provided insights on the experiences of these selected stakeholders. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of Transportation provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. While limited information is available to determine the frequency or nature of assaults by passengers at airports against airline customers, almost all of the randomly selected airline customers GAO interviewed reported experiencing verbal harassment, such as passengers yelling, swearing, or being argumentative. Almost half (46 of 104) also reported experiencing physical assaults. For example, 22 of the 104 surveyed customers reported that a passenger attempted to physically assault them by, for example, attempting to push them. Fewer (12) of the 102 surveyed customers said that passengers actually physically assaulted them. About one-third (34) of surveyed customers also said they experienced other types of harmful actions, which agents said included destroying property, taking video of agents, and stalking agents after work. Stakeholders GAO spoke with generally agreed that passengers can be verbally disruptive but that physical assaults are less frequent than verbal threats. However, some selected stakeholders told GAO opportunities exist to strengthen penalties for passenger assaults, including prosecuting passenger assaults as felonies, prosecuting these incidents at the federal level, or seeking a legislative change to classify airline customer Service agents as a protected class. The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018 requires airlines to develop and submit employee assault-prevention and response plans to FAA by January 2019. In March 2019, FAA officials said they had not received these plans from all airlines. FAA officials attributed delays in following up with airlines to the government shutdown in early 2019 and multiple competing requirements in the Act. Nevertheless, FAA said it plans to continue to follow up with the airlines as needed to collect the remaining plans. All of the selected stakeholders (23 of 23) who provided a perspective said that current state and local laws and resources sufficiently deter and address passenger assaults against airline customer agents, but some said stronger penalties and other legal avenues could be pursued. Seven selected state prosecutors told us that, among other offenses, they can charge passengers with assault; battery (e.g., intentional causing of bodily harm); disorderly conduct; disorderly conduct (i.e., acts that are of a nature to outrage the sense of public decency, or affect the peace and quiet of persons who may witness them, or engaging in brawling or fighting); and trespassing. Three of the seven prosecutors also told us they have charged passengers for assaults against customer service Agents as misdemeanors. Four selected prosecutors also said that passenger assaults might be charged as a felony if the crime involves the use of a deadly weapon or causes serious physical injury to the victim.
NNSA is responsible for managing and modernizing the nation's nuclear weapons and related capital asset projects. NNSA is currently conducting four weapon modernization programs—the W87-1 Modification, W80-4, W88 Alteration 370, B61-12 Life Extension Program, and W93—and plans to carry out additional programs over the next 2 decades. GAO was asked to testify on its work on NNSA's management of these programs and related projects. This testimony is based on prior GAO reports issued from 2003 through 2018, including GAO's most recent report issued in February 2020. For this testimony, GAO reviewed (1) the challenges NNSA faces in executing ongoing and planned weapon programs, (2) steps NNSA has taken to improve its management of weapon programs and enabling projects, and (3) the extent to which NNSA needs to take a portfolio-based approach to managing its modernization programs. To do this work,GAO reviewed program schedules, cost estimates, and budgets, and interviewed NNSA officials. The Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) faces challenges in executing and carrying out multiple weapon programs to modernize the nuclear stockpile. The agency is currently carrying out four weapon programs: the W87 Modification program, the B61/B61/LEP, the W80/W80/4 Life Extension program, W87/W93, and the B83/B83-1 bomb modernization program. To support and enable these programs, NNSA also plans to spend billions of dollars on capital assets projects and other infrastructure risk reduction and recapitalization efforts to modernized the production infrastructure to produce components and materials needed for its weapon programs. For example, in January 2018, GA O found that NNSA had not adopted the best practice of having an independent team validate its earned value management systems against the national standard for such systems, which could help the agency better manage risk in its weapon modernization projects. In addition, in September 2017 GAO found that the agency had not developed a complete scope of work, a life-cycle cost estimate, or an integrated master schedule for its overall uranium program—of which the Uranium Processing Facility is only one part—and had no time frame for doing so. As GAO reported in its February 2020 report, the plutonium program has begun to develop a schedule for pit production, but NNSA allows strategic materials programs to tailor their approach to developing schedules and does not require that they meet best practices for schedule estimating. In April 2017, in response to a GAO recommendation, the agency issued a new version of its Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, issued in July 2019, that includes a new section on affordability analysis, but does not provide information about how potential misalignment between the agency's modernization budget estimates and projections of the President's modernization budgets may be addressed, or about the potential impacts of adjusting program schedules or cost or schedule overruns. The President's fiscal year 2021 budget request for NNSA indicates that the bow wave has arrived, requesting an increase of about $3.1 billion over the funding enacted for Weapons Activities in fiscal year 2020—a year-to-year increase of over 25 percent. As NNSA continues to face challenges in carrying out its weapon and capital asset modernization programs, it needs to ensure that it has a portfolio of programs and projects to effectively manage cost, schedule, and risk. In its April 2017 report on NSA's budget materials and modernization plans for weapon modernization and enabling infrastructure efforts, which GAO issued in April 2017 and November 2018, both GAO concluded that NSA had not addressed the projected bow wave of future funding needs and the mismatch between those needs and potential funding available in the years in question. In February 2020, in its most recent classified report on the W 87-1 warhead program, which is to be issued in March 2020, and in June 2019, in addition to reviewing the status of other weapon modernization efforts, GA omits the impact of the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review on its portfolio of planned modernization programs and supporting infrastructure projects, but identifies additional actions NNSA could take to further improve the management of those programs. In prior work GAO has also recently completed work in which it reported on challenges integrating the schedules of NNSA weapon programs with the schedules for the Department of Defense's (DOD) modernized delivery systems. As we have recently reported
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) share oversight responsibility for IRA prohibited transactions. IRA owners are not permitted to engage in certain prohibited transactions involving IRA assets, such as transactions involving disqualified persons, self-dealing, or self-employment income. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which established IRAs and rules prohibiting certain IRA transactions, assigned IRA oversight roles to both DOL and IRS. To avoid confusion over dual jurisdiction, a 1978 Executive Order further clarified the agencies' roles and responsibilities. As a result, the authority to interpret the prohibited transaction rules and grant exemptions to those rules was transferred to DOL. The transfer did not affect IRS' ability to enforce the excise tax provisions or the tax consequences for IRA owners who are found to have engaged in a prohibited transaction. However, in enforcing such tax consequences, IRS is bound by the regulations, rulings, opinions, and exemptions issued by DOL, which can grant administrative exemptions to the rules on either an individual or a class basis. GAO was asked to review DOL's process for granting exemptions to prohibited IRA transaction rules. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOL has documented internal policies and procedures for reviewing IRA prohibited transaction exemption applications, and (2) the information sharing relationship between the two agencies on prohibited transaction exemptions. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOL regulations, guidance, and documents, and interviewed DOL officials and IRS officials. To grant an exemption from prohibited IRA transactions rules, DOL evaluates applications using statutory criteria and follows administrative procedures codified in regulations. For example, applicants must provide DOL with evidence that their prospective IRA transaction is substantially similar to other IRA transactions for which the agency has previously granted exemptions. If applicants find that they are substantially similar, they can follow an expedited process by submitting an “EXPRO” application. Exemption applications are required to cite prior exemptions granted by the agency to demonstrate that the proposed IRA transaction will be substantially similar. The time to complete the exemption process can range from a few months to more than more than a year. DOL generally has not sufficiently documented internal procedures and policies to manage and help ensure effective internal controls of its prohibited transactions exemption process. While DOL guidance and regulations detail the requirements for applicants, it generally lacks internal documentation of the steps and actions DOL staff are to follow when processing applications. The level and nature of documentation may vary based on the size of the organization and the complexity of the processes the organization performs, but documentation is still necessary. Documenting procedures also would provide greater transparency about how applications are handled, and can reduce the risk of employees carrying out their duties inconsistently. Some information sharing takes place between DL and IRS on applications for prohibited transactions exemptions, but no formal mechanism exists to help guide collaboration between the agencies. In 2003, the agencies completed an interagency memorandum of understanding (MOU) to coordinate their oversight of employer-sponsored retirement plans, but the MOU was last updated in 2013. Developing a similar mechanism to formalize the sharing of information between Dol and IRS regarding prohibited transactions could help the agencies better support their current coordination efforts and identify additional opportunities for greater collaboration.
Insurance is a critical part of the U.S. financial services industry. In recent years, advances in technology and widespread use of the internet have brought about significant changes in the financial industry, including changes in consumer expectations and preferences. For example, in recent years technology has changed consumer expectations, with younger consumers especially being well-versed in new technologies and looking to take a more hands-on approach to managing their finances. As a result, some insurers and insurtech companies have used technology to offer simpler insurance products and streamlined customer experiences. GAO was asked to review issues related to the use of technology in the insurance industry. This report (1) identifies uses of technologies and the benefits and challenges they might present for insurers and their customers, and (2) discusses what stakeholders identified as key challenges that could affect the adoption of new technologies, and actions that have been taken to address those challenges. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant literature and interviewed regulators, industry stakeholders, and experts in the field, and reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and other documents. Treasury and NAIC provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The insurance industry has begun to adopt several types of technology that are designed to provide a range of benefits to insurers and consumers (policyholders), including improved risk monitoring, reduced costs, and improved underwriting. However, these technologies also can create challenges for the industry and potential risks for consumers, including changed business models, pricing fairness, and privacy issues. Based on GAO's literature review and interviews with stakeholders, we identified six key technologies that have seen increased use and one technology (blockchain) that has seen limited adoption and which the industry has been exploring for wider use: Mobile apps. Insurers have been using mobile apps to make their products and services available on mobile devices. AI, algorithms, and machine learning. AI is the development of computer systems to perform tasks and make decisions that historically have required human intelligence to perform. Machine learning is a subset of AI and focuses on the ability of machines to receive a set of data and learn for themselves, changing algorithms as they learn more about the information they process. The internet of things. The Internet of things refers to semi-autonomous and internet-capable devices (such as machinery, home appliances, thermostats, and smartphones) that have sensors that interact with the physical environment and typically contain elements for processing and communicating information. For instance, a homeowner could have a smart home thermostat that sends alerts when the power goes off and indoor temperature decreases. With the homeowner able to address the issue in real time, the homeowner could mitigate the risk of frozen pipes bursting and potentially prevent a loss and an insurance claim. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), state insurance regulators, and others have initiated a number of actions intended to monitor and address industry and regulator concerns associated with insurtech, including any insurance rules and regulations that may affect insurers' adoption of technologies. These actions address challenges in areas such as evaluation of underwriting methodologies, approvals for new insurance products, customer notification methods and time frames, anti-rebating laws, cybersecurity, and regulator skillsets and resources. NAIC and state regulators have initiated actions to address these challenges while maintaining oversight of consumer protection issues.
The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) is responsible for conducting the decennial census, which counts the nation's approximately 140 million households. To help control costs while maintaining accuracy, the Bureau is making significant changes in each of these areas compared to prior decennials. For the 2020 Census, it plans to use technology to efficiently and effectively manage the fieldwork, and as a result, reduce the staffing, infrastructure, and brick-and-mortar footprint required for field operations. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's 2020 Census planning and training. This report assesses the extent to which the Bureau (1) is following its plans for space acquisition, recruiting and hiring, and training, and (2) has followed its training plans. To do this work, GAO reviewed Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials. The Bureau's efforts to open area census offices (ACO) appear to be on track, but the Bureau has made some schedule slippages. For example, as of June 3, 2019, 38 of 39 ACO were ready for business. However, seven offices are still working to finish the milestone of completing construction drawings, which had an original deadline of February 20, 2019. According to Bureau officials, these offices are being given priority attention by both the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Bureau. We will continue to monitor the opening of ACOs in ongoing work. The Census Bureau has exceeded its recruiting goals for early operations, but faces some challenges going forward. For 2020, it expects to hire nearly 400,000 temporary field staff from its applicant pool for two key operations: in-field address canvassing and nonresponse follow-up, where census staff visit households that do not return census forms to collect data in person. As of June 17, 2019 the Bureau had processed job applications and assessments for approximately 428,000 applicants, which represents about 208 percent of its roughly 205,000 recruiting goal. In contrast, in 2010 the Bureau recruited about 3.9 million applicants for these two field operations, which accounted for about 628,000 of the approximately 3 million applicants. Bureau officials stated that they plan to recruit and hire fewer temporary staff in 2020 compared to 2010, in part, because automation has made field operations more efficient. For 2018 End-to-End testing, the Census Bureau found the productivity for in- field address canvasing had exceeded its goal at all three test sites. The bureau plans to continue to use some of the same strategies it used to recruit all temporary workers as during the 2010 Census—because those strategies were successful—while also leveraging technology and social media. For instance, the overarching strategy for hiring enumerators is to hire people who will work in the communities where they live. This strategy provides the Bureau with enumerators who are familiar with the areas where they will be working and who speak the languages of the local community. To recruit staff, recruiting assistants are to work with local partnership staff and use paid advertisements and earned media (e.g., publicity gained through promotional efforts, news reports, etc.). The Bureau plans to also continue to using its recruiting website, http://www.2020census.gov/jobs, which provides information about the various positions, local pay rates, application materials, and job qualifications. Bureau documentation indicates that the Bureau will continue the use of waivers and hiring exemptions to enable well-qualified individuals to work on the 2020 census who otherwise might not have applied for jobs, particularly in hard- to-recruit areas. In addition to these previously used strategies, the bureau is planning to leverage technology in its recruiting strategy for 2020, including the Bureau-developed Response Outreach Area Mapper application, a publicly available online mapping tool that Bureau staff can use to better understand the sociodemographic makeup of their assigned areas and to develop recruitment strategies, such as hiring staff with specific language skills. The new technology also includes the MOJO Recruiting Dashboard, which is software for Census recruiting personnel to plan and manage recruiting activities and track recruiting progress for each census tract. The map draws attention to areas that may be experiencing recruiting problems (see fig. below). Red indicates areas where the Bureau was less than 50 percent of the way toward meeting its recruiting goal and yellow indicates areas in which it was between 50 and 79 percent toward meetings its goal. Green indicates areas that were in the 80 percent or higher level of progress toward meeting recruiting goals. For training, the agency has developed a blended
In 2017, three hurricanes—Harvey, Irma, and Maria—created an unprecedented demand for federal disaster response and recovery resources. As a result of these storms, Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico faced hardships, including devastation to infrastructure, such as highways and bridges. The island of Puerto Rico in particular was severely affected, which created multiple challenges for federal response efforts. The Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Emergency Relief Program provides funding to states and territories to repair or reconstruct highways and roads and bridges that have sustained serious damage from natural disasters or catastrophic failures that are not eligible for federal-aid highway funding. GAO was asked to review FHWA's emergency relief program. This report examines (1) the extent to which the 2017 hurricanes have caused highway and bridge damage and (2) how FHwA has applied Emergency Relief program guidance to selected projects in recent emergency events and whether documentation has improved since GAO's 2011 report. To do this work, GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 39 emergency relief project files from three states that received more than $1 million in federal funds from fiscal years 2007 through 2010, reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and guidance, and interviewed FHWA and state and local officials. To date, states and Puerto Rican officials have identified approximately $1 billion in Highway and Bridge Damages Caused by the 2017 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Following the hurricanes, state officials prepared damage assessments that identified more than 2,500 projects eligible for emergency relief funds. Projects range in size and cost from replacing signage and traffic signals to multi-million dollar bridge and highway repairs. Following a number of natural disasters in 2017—including hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma—Congress appropriated more than$1 billion to the Emergency Relief Fund in February 2018 to help states repair and rebuild highways. In addition, in June 2019, Congress appropriated $3 billion for the program in the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019, which will be used to repair damages caused by the hurricanes. As of September 2019, FHwa has allocated $634 million to repair hurricane-related damage in Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas. Specifically, immediately following the hurricanes in August, September, and November 2017 FHwoA allocated $122.5 million in quick release funding to Florida,Texas, and Rico, $242 million in April 2018, and $130 million more in February 2019 to Puerto Rico. Most recently, in September 2019 FHAWA allocated an additional $208 million to Puerto Puerto Rico for repairs. While the estimated repair costs exceed the amount of funds allocated by FHawA, officials stated that additional emergency relief Funds are allocated and reimbursed approximately every 6 months and states and Territories will be reimbursed for all eligible expenses related to hurricanes Harvey and Maria as they are completed. These funding decisions are to be made as FHawsa continues to review and approve projects and Congress appropriates additional funds. In the absence of well-documented rationales for classifying projects, more clearly defined terms and circumstances for making these decisions, and time frames for accomplishing them, Fhawsa may have inappropriately classified projects as emergency repairs, which may have resulted in the federal government forgoing millions of dollars in state contributions, thus increasing the federal fiscal exposure in disasters. For example, 22 out of 25 emergency repair projects GAO examined—which account for approximately $50 million in emergency relief funding—did not include a documented justification for being classified as an emergency repair instead of a permanent repair, and FHawa officials in Puerto Rico reported undertaking 34 emergency repairs more than 180 days after the hurricanes and continuing to classify them as emergency repair without documenting the basis for doing so. In contrast, 39 of the emergency relief projects reviewed included photographs of the damage and a repair cost estimate; whereas, only 24 of 83 projects reviewed in 2011 included this information. According to Federal Internal Control Standards, to achieve objectives and identify and respond to risks, management should clearly document all transactions and significant events, and define objectives clearly, including specific terms so that they can easily be understood. FH WA did not clearly document decisions to classify emergency projects as repairs because there is no requirement to do so, and existing requirements did not apply in the case of extending emergency repairs beyond 180 days. In some cases, officials in one division office made emergency repair decisions that differed from officials in another division office, which could have affected the level of FH
DOD relies on physicians and dentists to provide health care to military personnel and their dependents, including active-duty servicemembers, retirees, and their families. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to recruit and retain these personnel. This report examines (1) how compensation for military physicians and Dentists compares to that of private sector civilians with comparable skills in 2017, (2) the extent to which DOD has developed an approach for recruiting and retaining these personnel that reflects key principles of effective human capital management, and (3) the perceptions of military medical students, residents, and DOD officials regarding active- duty service obligations. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD's pay plans, policies, and other documents and interviewed officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD(HA), the military departments, and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). GAO also conducted surveys with a generalizable sample of current scholarship and University medical students to obtain information on their knowledge of the current program and willingness to accept different lengths of service obligations, as well as eight focus groups with a nongeneralizable group of 79 military medical residents at three military treatment facilities to obtain the perspectives of medical residents on issues related to the nature of active service obligations and the relative importance of the service obligations in relation to other factors at different decision points, including accepting the scholarship or attending the University; participating in a military residency program; and choosing a medical specialty to pursue. In 2017, cash compensation for medical physicians and dentist was generally less than the median of private-sector civilian compensation for most specialties GAO examined. However, a substantial portion of the costs of DOD's overall compensation package is comprised of deferred and noncash benefits provided to active personnel, such as a pension and tuition-free medical and dental education, but it is difficult to determine the extent of servicemember value these benefits. Based on GAO's analysis of the Department of Defense's (DOD) package of incentives, DOD generally applied four key principles to its approach to recruiting and retain military physicians, but GAO found that DOD did not consistently collect information to help inform investment decisions in its package of incentive pays for physicians and dental specialists. These principles include clearly defined criteria on when to use incentives, making investments based on expected improvement in agency results, identifying and evaluating unique staffing situations, and identifying and incorporating opportunities for improvement. For example, in 2018, DOD established a new 6-year retention bonus in the fiscal year 2019 pay plan for select medical and Dentist specialties, in part to ensure greater stability in the numbers of physicians and Dental Corps members within these specialties. DOD officials stated that they plan to identify potential impacts and determine adjustments, if any, that need to be made. By collecting and using this information to inform its decision-making, DOD would be better positioned to assess the effectiveness of its incentives and make sound investment decisions for the future. DOD concurred with all three recommendations in this report.
DOD is responsible for preventing, responding to, and resolving incidents of child abuse, including child-on-child abuse, on military installations and involving military dependents and servicemembers overseas. GAO was asked to review DOD's child abuse policies and procedures. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD and the military services have taken steps to augment existing child abuse policy and procedures to address incidents of abuse, and (2) how DOD collaborates with other governmental and nongovernmental organizations to address child abuse incidents. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and procedures; interviewed DOD and military service officials; and conducted nongeneralizable interviews with parents and guardians of children affected by abuse at five installations selected based on geographic location, number of reported incidents, and other factors. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps in response to provisions in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 to expand policies and processes for responding to and resolving child abuse. For example, in May 2019, DOD issued a revised Family Advocacy Program (FAP) instruction that establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for the FAP specific to child abuse and problematic sexual behavior in children and youth, and in July 2019, it revised FAP standards to implement policy and provide procedures for addressing such behavior. However, gaps exist in DOD's and the services' processes to respond to and resolve incidents of abusive child behavior. Specifically, the services may lack pertinent stakeholder perspectives on the Independent Determination Committee (IDC) after DOD policy changed the permanent voting membership of the committee. In addition, families of abuse victims may receive inconsistent levels of information following a child abuse report, which can cause confusion and prevent them from receiving available services. Further, service guidance regarding the extent of commander authority to remove children from unsafe homes overseas is unclear. Finally, the availability of certified pediatric sexual assault forensic examiners is limited, especially overseas. DOD has taken some actions to increase collaboration with the Department of Justice (DOJ) in addressing the abuse of children on military bases, such as establishing a joint working group to coordinate on issues related to the issue, including the relinquishment of exclusive federal jurisdiction to the states. DOD and DOJ officials agreed that the federal justice system is not well suited to prosecuting juvenile offenses because it lacks a dedicated juvenile justice system and that state courts, which aim to be rehabilitative in nature, are better suited to adjudicate these cases. The difficulties of addressing child abuse are exacerbated when the incident occurs overseas, where no U.S. state authorities exist to assume jurisdiction. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act can be used to either prosecute child offenders as adults—for certain violent or controlled substance violations—or to initiate federal delinquency proceedings. While both DOD and DOD officials stated that they prefer to refer children to state courts for juvenile offenses, this is currently not possible when the incidents occur overseas. Officials stated that the working group continues to research and discuss these types of issues to improve collaboration between the two departments and identify solutions to these important issues.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) oversees a number of programs designed to provide small businesses with resources and tools, including access to capital, help with federal contracting opportunities, and entrepreneurial counseling and training. GAO was asked to review options for increasing contracting opportunities for mid-sized businesses. This report analyzes (1) the extent to which small businesses grew to be mid- sized and continued to receive federal contracts; (2) instances in which mid-owned businesses can perform work on contracts set aside for small businesses; and (3) options to increase federal contracting opportunity for these businesses and views on the strengths and limitations of the options. GA O reviewed federal procurement data for fiscal years 2008 through 2017, the most recent complete data available at the time of GAO's review; reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; reviewed literature; and interviewed federal agencies, trade associations, and researchers. A very small percentage of the small businesses that were awarded set-aside contracts in fiscal year 2008 (the most recent year for which complete data were available when GAO began its review) grew to mid-size in subsequent years and continued receiving federal contracts. About 2.5 percent of such businesses had become midsized by fiscal year 2017. Federal regulations generally allow a small business with a contract to continue performing under its contract if it outgrows the size standard that it met in its initial offer. If a business qualified as small and was awarded a single-award contract under a small-business set-Aside, it generally would be considered small for contracting purposes for the life of that contract. The business can continue providing the service or product. Additionally, the agency can continue counting the contract towards its small business goals unless the business is required to recertify, whether through a regulatory or contractual requirement, and in doing so is deemed other than small. Once the contract ends, the follow-on or renewal contract is a new contract; size is determined as of the date the business bids on the new contract. Some multiple-awards contracts are set aside only for small business only. The Small Business Act of 1953 authorized SBA to establish size standards for determining eligibility for all procurement programs in which small business status is required or advantageous. SBA uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as the basis for its size standards. The standards vary by industry and are generally expressed as the average number of employees over a 12-month period or average annual receipts in the previous 3 years. As of August 2019, SBA's employee-based size standards ranged from 100 to 1,500 and revenue-based standards ranged as high as $1.0 million to $41.5 million. The small businesses closest to their SBA standards (above 75 percent of their size standard) were awarded about 2 percent of the set- aside contracts and about 7 percent of contract dollar obligations in fiscal years 2017 and 2014, according to GAO analysis of Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data. Stakeholders GAO interviewed offered a range of views on options to enhance contracting opportunities and options proposed by stakeholders for increasing opportunities for businesses that have grown to the size of small businesses. For example, several stakeholders said that establishing a separate category of small business contracts would increase contracting opportunities. However, some stakeholders expressed concerns that the potential threat to small businesses and administrative burden on agencies might outweigh this benefit. For instance, one stakeholder said that agencies would benefit from being able to retain contractors even if the contractors outgrew their size standards, while another said that allowing small businesses to move to the unrestricted version of a contract might increase administrative burden for agencies. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, General Services Administration, and SBA provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate.
This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's May 2019 report, which is being released today (May 2019). In May 2019, GAO found that individuals with disabilities may have faced challenges accessing basic services from local shelters, including restrooms and food, according to state, territorial, local, and nonprofit officials in Florida, Puerto Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. GAO also found that the substantial damage caused by the 2017 hurricanes prevented or slowed some individuals with disability from obtaining food and water. For example, in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, centralized distribution models, in which the majority of food was distributed to centralized locations around the islands, posed a major barrier to people with mobility challenges or without caregivers who had to rely on home delivery, which took time and in some cases, did not happen. In addition, Hurricane Maria survivors also faced challenges obtaining needed medication and oxygen in Puerto Rican and Virgin Islands according to territorial and nonprofit official and survivors GAO interviewed. FEMA has taken a number of steps toward addressing GAO recommendations related to how it supports people with disabilities in obtaining disaster assistance, such as implementing new registration-intake questions to improve its ability to identify and address survivors' disability-related needs. However, in May 2019 GAO reported that FEMA had taken limited steps to effectively implement its new approach to disability integration. Specifically, FEMA had not developed a plan for training all deployable staff and staff in programmatic offices on disability issues during response and recovery deployments. In February 2017, FEMA stopped offering a 2-day introductory training course on disability integration to its nonfederal partners, which included substantial information on how to incorporate the needs of people with disability in emergency planning. FEMA officials told GAO during its 2019 review they had determined that the course did not provide actionable training to emergency management partners and planned to replace it, but had not provided a timeline for doing so, which would help ensure that partners are provided with timely information on inclusive emergency management practices. In June 2019, FEMA officials said they had begun procuring external consulting services to redevelop the suspended course. According to the officials, an in-person, exercise-based course with remote participation capabilities would be an appropriate replacement and will be ready to field by August 2020. Aspects of FEMA's application process for assistance following the 2017 disasters created challenges for Individuals with Disabilities. To receive FEMA assistance under FEMA's Individuals and Households Program, through which disaster survivors can receive help with housing and other needs, individuals must register by answering a standard series of intake questions. In its May 2019 review of FEMA applications for assistance after the hurricanes Harvey and Irma—which were concurrently being applied for through a FEMA helpline in the days after the disasters—GAO found long wait times and unclear registration questions, and that FEMA's internal communication across its programs about survivors' needs was ineffective. In particular, FEMA's registration process did not give individuals a clear opportunity to state they have a disability or request an accommodation because the registration did not directly ask registrants to provide this information. As a result, registrants may not have requested accommodations or reported their disability and related needs during the registration process. FEMA also did not effectively track and communicate information about individuals' disability needs across its assistance programs after such needs were identified. In May 2018, FEMA began implementing a new disability integration approach, but GAO recommended that FEMA establish and disseminate a set of objectives for the new approach. FEMA concurred with this recommendation, and in July 2019 officials provided GAO with the draft of ODIC's strategic plan for 2019-2022, which includes strategic goals and objectives that the new disability integrated approach can help achieve. FEMA's draft strategic plan is likely to help facilitate consistent implementation agency-wide, and GAO will continue to monitor FEMA's actions as it makes additional progress toward addressing the recommendations.
In 2015, GAO found that the United States lacked a comprehensive national aviation-preparedness plan to limit the spread of communicable diseases through air travel, though some individual airport and airline preparedness plans did exist. GAO recommended that DOT work with relevant stakeholders, such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to develop a national aviation preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks. A national plan would provide a coordination mechanism for the public-health and aviation sectors to more effectively prevent and control a communicable health threat while also minimizing unnecessary disruptions to the national aviation system. DOT and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) agreed in 2015 and continue to agree today that such a plan could add value. DOT, however, maintains that those agencies that have both legal authority and expertise for emergency response and public health—namely DHS and HHS—are best positioned to take the lead role in developing a plan within the existing interagency framework for national-level all-hazards emergency preparedness planning. DOT would be in the best position to lead the effort because FAA and DOT have stronger and deeper ties to, as well as oversight responsibility for, the relevant stakeholders that would be most involved in such a broad effort, namely airlines, airports, and other aviation stakeholders. In addition, DOT's Office of the Secretary is the liaison to ICAO for Annex 9 to the Chicago Convention, in which the relevant International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard is contained. This testimony addresses the extent to which (1) the U.S. aviation system remains insufficiently prepared to respond to Communicable Disease Threats and (2) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken steps to improve the management of its research and development (R&D) portfolio. This statement is based on GAO's prior work issued from January 2015 through June 2020, including selected updates conducted in June 2020. In the continued absence of a Comprehensive National Plan for Communicable Diseases through Air Travel: In 2015, we reported that the nation's aviation system remained insufficiently Prepared to Respond to communicable Disease threats. Specifically, we found that while some individual airports and airlines had plans for responding to disease threats, they were not required to do so, and no federal agency tracks which airports or airlines have them. As such, the extent of U. S. airports' and airlines' preparedness is unknown. However, all 14 airports and 3 airlines GAO reviewed in 2015 had independently developed preparedness Plans for Responding to Communicative Disease Threat from abroad. These plans generally addressed the high-level components that we identified as common among applicable federal and international guidance for emergency preparednesses, suchAs establishment of an incident command center and activation triggers for a response. While the 14 airports, 3 airlines, and 2 airports had plans that address communicable Diseases, representatives from these airports and three airlines reported facing multiple challenges in responding to threats. Identified challenges included obtaining guidance; communication and coordination among responders; and assuring employees have appropriate training, equipment, and sanitary workplaces. As we stated in our 2015 report, a national plan to address communicative disease threats could help address these challenges. As of June 2019, DOT, DHS, and HHS stated that the federal government still has not developed a national health-care-related national aviation plan. FAA has taken some actions to improve its R&D portfolio management, but has conducted limited research on disease transmission in aircraft and airports. In 2017, we assessed FAA's actions to manage its portfolio of research projects and found that FAA could be more strategic in how it develops its portfolio, chiefly in identifying long-term research needs and in improving disclosure of how projects are selected. As a result, FAA management could not be assured that the highest priority research was being conducted. FAA's research goals focus on areas like improving airport operations and air space management, and developing new technologies, which FAA has aligned to DOT's strategic goals related to safety, infrastructure, and innovation.
This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's report being released today on the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) oversight of the Home Equity Reverse Mortgage (HECM) program, which is intended to help seniors age in place. GAO found that FHA has not performed comprehensive on-site reviews of HECM servicers' compliance with program requirements since fiscal year 2013 and does not have current procedures for conducting these reviews. FHA officials said they planned to resume these reviews in fiscal year 2020, starting with three servicers that account for most of the market. However, as of August 2019, FHA had not developed updated review procedures (they were last updated in 2009) and did not have a risk-based method for prioritizing reviews. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has examined reverse mortgage servicers and plans to continue doing so, according to CFPB officials, but does not share results with FHA because the agencies do not have an agreement in place to share supervisory information. CFPP began collecting reverse mortgage consumer complaints in December 2011 and has collected about 3,600 complaints since then. In April 2019, the FHA Resource Center became the agency's primary entity for collecting, recording, and responding to all calls related to HECMs. The purpose of this testimony is to (1) provide an overview of FHA's oversight of servicers, (2) assess the extent to which FHA collects and analyzes consumer complaint data, and (3) describe the extent of oversight and collaboration on oversight between FHA and CFP B. To do this work, GAO reviewed FHA data and documents, and interviewed FHA, CFPb, and servicers officials. This testimony is based on a report that GAO is releasing today (GAO-19-631R). GAO analyzed FHA documents and data from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 on HECm terminations, defaults, foreclosure prevention options, and other loan outcomes, and conducted a detailed analysis of a random, generalizable sample of 100 consumer complaint narratives drawn from all the reverse mortgage complaints CFPBs received in calendar years 2015 through 2018. The results of this review are not generalizable, but provide insights into the H ECM program. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHHA) monitoring, performance assessment, and reporting for the Home equity reverse mortgage program have weaknesses. For example, the data collected by FHA do not provide comprehensive and accurate data about the reasons why HECms terminate, a key servicing event. For about 30 percent of the HEC Ms that terminated in fiscal years 2018 and 2014, GA O was unable to determine the reason for termination. GA O found that the percentage of terminations due to defaults increased from 2 percent in 2014 to 18 percent in 2018, and that most defaults were due to borrowers not meeting occupancy requirements or failing to pay property charges. In addition, the number of foreclosures due to borrower defaults rose from a peak of roughly 82,000 in 2016 to about 60,000 for fiscal year 2018. F HA does not regularly track and report on loan termination data and has not established comprehensive performance indicators, such as the proportion of borrowers with delinquent property charges or distressed borrowers who have received foreclosure prevention alternatives. For instance, since 2015, F HA has allowed borrowers who are behind on property charges repayment plans, but as of the end of fiscal year2018, only about 22 percent of these borrowers had received this option. Also, while FHA created a low-balance extension in 2016—which allows servicers to delay calling a HEC M due and payable if the borrower owes less than $2,000—FHA officials told GAO they do not track how often servicers use this option and do not know how many borrowers may have been eligible for this option at the time of termination. In the report released today, we recommend FHA take steps to improve the quality and accuracy of the data it collects and uses to monitor the performance of the program, including taking steps to update the termination reasons in its Home equity Reverse Mortgage Information Technology system.
DHS plays a critical role in protecting the nation against threats to national security, public safety, and economic well-being. In fiscal year 2018, DHS's budget authority totaled about $74 billion, and its workforce of more than 240,000 employees has grown to more than 260,000. DHS's management functions are critical to its ability to carry out its mission, including those related to border security, information technology (IT), financial management, human capital, and human capital management. GAO has designated DHS as a high-risk area since 1997 because of its size, complexity, and susceptibility to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. This statement discusses DHS's progress in (1) strengthening and integrating its management functions, (2) implementing its Integrated Strategy for High-Risk Management, and (3) addressing the 13 outcomes it has not fully addressed. This testimony is based on prior GAO reports issued from January 2010 through March 2019. To conduct these reviews, GAO analyzed DHS documents and interviewed DHS officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made important progress in strengthening its management, but considerable work remains. DHS has met 3 out of 5 criteria for removal from the High Risk List--leadership commitment, action planning, and monitoring progress--and partially met the remaining two criteria--capacity and demonstrated, sustained progress. With regard to leadership commitment, DHS has continued to demonstrate commitment and support for addressing the department's management challenges. For example, in January 2011, DHS produced its first integrated strategy for high risk management and has issued 14 updated versions since then, most recently in September 2018. The September 2018 strategy describes DHS’s progress to-date, planned corrective actions to further strengthen its management function, and includes performance measures to monitor key management initiatives. In addition, in March 2019, DHS updated its approach for managing its portfolios of IT investments across all components, and in November 2018, its financial statement auditor reported that DHS had made progress in correcting its prior year IT security weaknesses. In the last 2 years DHS has made particular progress in the areas of human capital and IT management. Specifically, since 2017 DHS has taken steps to fully address 4 outcomes in these areas, mostly addressed 4, partially addressed 6, and initiated actions to address the remaining 3 outcomes. The department fully addressed two key human capital outcomes by demonstrating that components are basing hiring decisions and promotions on human capital competencies and strengthening employee engagement efforts. DHS also fully addressed 2 IT outcomes by providing ongoing oversight and support to troubled IT investments to help improve their cost, schedule, and performance; and demonstrating significant progress in implementing its IT strategic workforce planning initiative. DHS continues to face challenges in all of the five key areas, including acquisition management, IT management, financial management and financial management. For the 15th consecutive year, the auditor designated deficiencies in IT systems controls as a material weakness for financial reporting purposes. Work also remains in implementing GAO's six open recommendations concerning DHS's cybersecurity workforce assessment requirements. Finally, DHS also faces challenges in fulfilling its pivotal role in government-wide cybersecurity efforts, as identified in GAOs Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation high risk area.
In March and April 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) suspended operations at all of its 248 Area Census Offices (ACO) after the World Health Organization declared the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Centers for Infectious Disease Research and Pandemic Preparedness-19 (COVID-19) a pandemic, just a day before invitations to respond to the 2020 Census were scheduled to arrive in mailboxes across the country and as peak census operations were set to begin. The Bureau suspended operations until June 1 and extended key operations. Since that time, the Bureau announced it would resume operations at additional ACOs each week, and as of June 11 all ACOs had resumed operations. GAO was asked to testify on the Bureau's progress in reopening its ACOs. This testimony is based on GAO's prior work, including a May 2019 report (GAO-2019-10-852T). It addresses (1) key aspects of reopening Bureau ACOs, (2) key issues for federal agencies to consider as their employees reenter the workplace, and (3) key practices for ensuring that telework contributes to continuity of operations during the current pandemic and provides an expanded workforce option in the future. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Census Bureau took a phased approach to resuming operations at its nationwide ACOs and made operational changes in response to challenges related to the pandemic declaration. For example, it delayed operations that require interviewing residents, such as Non-Response Follow Up, until August and modified its Update Leave operation, which requires field staff to update addresses by observation when delivering a questionnaire, instead of knocking on doors to speak with residents. To reduce in-person contact for Group Quarters, which enumerates facilities such as prisons, nursing facilities, and college dormitories, Bureau officials told GAO they were contacting facilities to encourage them to shift from in-Person enumeration to electronic responses. In late April the Bureau authorized ACOs to call those facilities that had previously opted to respond by providing a paper listing of residents. Bureau staff asked the facilities to mail the listing back to the ACO rather than having the ACOs send staff to pick up the paper listing. To ensure that workers have adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and cleaning supplies, Bureau announced that it had ordered this equipment for all field staff and that these materials would be secured and provided before resumption of operations. Bureau officials said they are distributing PPE and supplies to its 248 ACOs on a rolling basis, prioritizing delivery to those ACOs that were resuming major field operations such as Update Leave. In a late May survey, ACO manager satisfaction was relatively high regarding PPE for staff conducting Update Leave (66 percent), the largest field operation being conducted at the time. In contrast, managers at that time reported some of their lowest satisfaction rates when asked about PPE adequacy for their office and field workers more generally (34 and 43 percent, respectively). GAO has previously reported on how federal agencies were planning to protect their federal workers during a Pandemic, as well as lessons learned from the H1N1 pandemic. Based on these lessons, and further informed by more recent events, we have identified key issues that federal agencies should consider as federal employees return to the workplace. Agencies should maintain continuous communication with employees, and their representatives, during aPandemic. In particular, agencies should identify employee concerns and communicate human capital guidance such as pay, leave, staffing, and other human capital flexibilities to employees to help to ensure the continuity of agencies' operations and mission essential functions. It is important that employees understand the policies and requirements of their agencies, and the alternatives, including telework, that may be available to them. In addition, it is important for agencies to make decisions about reentry based on local conditions rather than applying across-the-board decisions based on agencies' headquarters locations.
The Department of Defense's (DOD) excess defense article (EDA) program is one of several programs designed to build partner capacity through the provision of excess defense equipment and services to foreign governments or international organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These items can include aircraft, ammunition, clothing, radios, trucks, and spare parts. DOD's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), within the Department of Commerce, is responsible for approving transfers of EDA items, including Humvees, to support foreign governments' security efforts. GAO was asked to review DOD's EDA program. This report provides information about (1) DOD's approval of grant transfers of excess HMMWV requested by foreign governments from fiscal years 2012 through 2018 and (2) how the Humvee manufacturer's perspectives on the proposed transfers have been addressed by DOD as part of the determination of any adverse industrial base effects. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed DOD data on transfers of HMMwV from fiscal year 2012 to 2018, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed officials from DSCA and the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Commerce Department. DOD approved nearly half of the excess defense articles (EDAs) that foreign governments requested for transfer in support of their security efforts for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, but has not approved any requests since the start of fiscal year 2017. The majority of these EDA transfers were to countries in the Middle East and Africa regions, which accounted for 75 percent of the vehicles requested over this period. However, the number that was actually delivered was less than those approved because DOD decreased the number or foreign governments canceled their requests for various reasons. For example, in December 2017, Congress enacted a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018 that requires EDA HumveE transfers to be modernized with an armored or armor-capable crew compartment and a new, modernized powertrain prior to transfer. Since the provision's enactment, DOD has not exercised the authority to waive this legislative requirement for any EDA request. Foreign governments have not been willing to pay for the modernization, so approvals have halted. According to DOD officials, these requests likely will remain unapproved for the foreseeable future; however, the provision requiring the refurbishment of excess HumveES prior to the transfer is set to expire in December 2020. DOD is encouraging foreign governments to look at other options to meet their fleet requirements, such as purchasing new vehicles, but DOD does not have any low-cost vehicles to offer as an alternative solution. DOD officials and Army documents GAO reviewed noted that even if foreign governments were able to independently fund the modernization costs, there are not sufficient quantities of the newer model HumVEes in inventory that can support the additional weight of the added armored capabilities for the modernized crew compartment. Additionally, most of DOD's inventory of older models are older models that would first require a new expanded vehicle chassis to withstand the weight of adding armor. The officials likened the modernization process for the older modelHumvees to essentially building a whole new vehicle. D SCA's determinations of whether there is an adverse industrialbase effect to approve Humveed transfers are largely based on objections from the manufacturer about proposed transfers. Since 2015, the manufacturer has objected more frequently to proposed transfers of vehicles to foreign countries. In all but one instance when the manufacturer objected to a transfer, DSCa and BIS took steps to address concerns of the manufacturer and reach a resolution, suchAs providing the manufacturer Humveer refurbishment work. In response, the contractor withdrew over a third of its objections based on receiving this type of work or reaching agreements with foreign governments. The remaining transfers were cancelled; put on hold pending resolution with the manufacturer; or moved forward with an objection in place.
The opioid crisis has led to an estimated overdose death rate in the United States that is greater than the rate of any other year since 1999, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). To address the opioid crisis, the federal government is working with states and localities to address the workforce needs of those affected by SUD, such as job seekers and their potential employers. GAO was asked to review workforce efforts to address SUD. This report examines (1) the extent to which workforce agencies are addressing the workforce impacts of opioid use disorder (SUD) through the workforce system, and (2) the challenges workforce agencies face in serving job seekers in recovery and potential employers who are interested in hiring those in recovery. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed federal, state, and local workforce officials in four selected states that received targeted grants from DOL; and interviewed workforce agency officials in six states that did not receive targeted grants but are still experiencing high levels of opioid misuse. The Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Employment and Training (ETA) is responsible for some Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) programs, which provide education and other services to help job seekers obtain employment and advance in the labor market, including job search assistance, career counseling, and a variety of occupational skills such as classroom and on-the-job training. In addition, WIOA emphasizes that employers are also customers of the workforce systems, and includes provisions that involve them in helping the system provide the skilled workers they need. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is one of more than a dozen federal agencies that have responsibilities for drug prevention, treatment, and law enforcement activities. As federal agencies engage in drug control efforts, ONDCP is responsible, among other things, for overseeing and coordinating the implementation of national drug control policy. These responsibilities include promulgating a National Drug control Strategy. In 2017 and 2018, ONdCP lacked a statutorily-required strategy, and GAO recently reported that the 2019 strategy did not fully comply with the law. In its March 2019 High-Risk report, which is based on a body of work related to drug misuse—including 25 new GAO products issued since that time—GAO named drug misuse as an emerging issue requiring close attention. DOL's Phase 1 and Phase 2 grants, targeted to support efforts for addressing the opioid epidemic, are authorized by WIO a, which was enacted in 2014 and emphasizes the alignment and integration of workforce programs. These grants are intended, in part, to serve dislocated workers—adults whose jobs have been terminated, who have been laid off, or who were self-employed. These grant funds are awarded to states, tribal governments, or outlying areas that, in turn, may work with local workforce boards to administer the grants. Grant recipients generally have 2 years to expend their funds. Workforce agencies in GAO's selected states reported that they face challenges addressing the needs of job seekers with SUD and their employers. For example, officials in all six states said they continue to struggle with ensuring job seekers receive necessary services due to lack of medical treatment, mental health services, and recovery services and personnel, especially in rural areas. Officials in four of the six states told GAO that it would be useful for DOL to share information about lessons learned and successful strategies with all states, given that many states are in the early stages of developing their programs. Officials said that information based on the experiences of their peers would assist states in ensuring those in Recovery are job ready and in hiring and retaining these workers. In particular, officials from Arizona—a state without a targeted DOL grant—told GAO their communities could benefit from learning about experiences of states or local areas that have addressed the crisis in the workforce, especially those using an approach that offers wraparound services such as transportation assistance.
In March 2016, GAO reported that only limited nationwide data exist on the availability of sexual assault forensic examiners—that is, both the number of practicing examiners and health care facilities that have examiner programs. GAO was asked to update its March 2016 report. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which nationwide data are available on the number and location of examiners, (2) the challenges selected states face in maintaining a supply of trained examiners to meet communities' needs, and (3) strategies selected states have used to increase or mitigate limited stakeholder support for examiners. To conduct this work, GA O reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and literature; interviewed officials in six states selected based on geographic location and examiner program size; and interviewed officials from federal, state, and local organizations, such as law enforcement and prosecutors, that provide support to examiners or examiner programs in those states. Nationwide data on the Availability of Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners: GAO's March 2016 review of six selected states found that only one of the six states has a system in place to formally track the number, location, and staffing characteristics of its examiners; however, officials in all six states told GAO that the number available does not meet the need for exams within their states. For example, grant administrators and sexual assault coalition officials in Colorado, Florida, Nebraska, and Wisconsin told us that nearly half of all counties in the state do not have any examiner programs available. In addition, in four of the selected states, officials said that few or some facilities in their state have examiners available. As a consequence, they said victims may need to travel long distances to be examined by a trained examiner or be examined without a medical professional without specialized training. Officials in five of six states said that limited support from hospitals and law enforcement, which may be reluctant to support examiners due to a low number of cases treated each year, is a challenge to maintaining the supply oftrained examiners in these states. Officials from four of these states also said that low examiner retention rates can be an impediment to maintaining an examiner supply. In contrast, officials from five states said they have developed sexual assault response teams in their states to help community stakeholders understand examiners' role and better coordinate to meet the medical and legal needs of sex assault victims. Training and retaining examiners: Officials in four states reported that limited training opportunities, technical assistance and other supportive resources, and lack of leadership and other support are among the challenges to maintaining a trained supply of examining staff. Officials said that the physically and emotionally demanding nature of examiner work also contributes to low retention rates. Further, studies have indicated that dissatisfaction with compensation, long work hours, and a lack of support, among other things, may contribute to examiner burnout. Officials GAO spoke to told us about strategies that can be used to address these challenges, including offering web-based technical assistance, developing regional examiner list-serves and online discussion boards, and creating formal leadership positions within the examiner community.
Airlines commonly overbook their flights to avoid revenue losses associated with passenger no-shows as part of their revenue management strategies. GAO was asked to review issues related to passenger denied boarding. This report examines (1) the number of passengers denied boarding involuntarily, (2) the effects of involuntary denied boardings on passengers, and (3) actions airlines have taken to reduce such incidents and minimize their effects on passengers. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Department of Transportation (DOT) on denied boarding from 2012 to 2018, reviewed passenger complaints submitted to DOT in May and June 2019, and interviewed representatives from DOT, industry associations, and consumer advocates. DOT provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The total number of people denied boarding—voluntarily or involuntarily—on flights generally decreased from 2012 through 2018, but some passengers denied boarding reported significant inconveniences. For example, in 2018, for every 100,000 actual boardings, about 43 passengers were voluntarily denied boarding and about one passenger was involuntarily denied boarding, a rate of less than 0.1 percent. Passenger complaints submitted directly to DOT about denied boarding also generally decreased, from about 650 in 2015 to about 410 in 2018. However, in some cases, airlines can accommodate passengers in a different section of the aircraft, either by upgrading or downgrading passengers. In recent years, until 2018, airlines have generally upgraded fewer passengers to avoid denied boarding to avoid overbooking, according to industry representatives and GAO's review of DOT data. Airlines have taken a range of actions, primarily intended to reduce involuntary deniedBoarding, such as reducing the rate or eliminating overbookings. Some of these actions also provide additional incentives for passengers to volunteer to be denied boarding by offering them additional compensation. For instance, some airlines solicit passengers with flexible travel plans to identify compensation amounts they would willingly accept in exchange for voluntarily giving up their seats and taking another flight. Once passengers submit their required compensation amount to the airline, the airline can then use that information to select passengers with the lowest amount of required compensation to accept a denied boarded flight. Airlines conduct this process on their website, via their mobile app, or at the check-in kiosk. While representatives from both consumer advocate organizations GAO interviewed generally supported some of the airlines' actions to manage oversold flights, they also identified additional actions that airlines or DOT could take to reduce or eliminate involuntary denied Boarding. Specifically, both consumer advocates GAO spoke to would like to see airlines increase transparency and passenger education related to denied boarding compensation. These advocates believe that prior to agreeing to be voluntarily denied boarded, airlines should be required to inform passengers of the current compensation amounts for involuntary denied boards and that compensation can be provided by cash or check (as opposed to a voucher). Additionally, they would like DOT to issue a rule clarifying, among other things, that the compensation amounts set by DOT are the minimum compensation amounts that passengers can receive. DOT officials indicated that DOT intends to issue its final rule in July 2020.
DOD requires each Military Service to establish its own EFMP for active duty servicemembers. EFMPs are to have three components—identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support. In May 2018, GAO reported that DOD's OSN had several efforts underway to improve its oversight of the EFMP. GAO was asked to testify on the findings from its May 2018 report. This testimony is based on that report and addresses (1) the extent to which DOD provides family support for families with special needs, (2) how OSN oversees EFMP oversight, (3) key aspects of family support that vary across the Military Services, and (4) OSN's monitoring of EFMP performance. To address these objectives GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DOD guidance; interviewed DOD officials; and conducted fieldwork at five installations selected based on size, location, and other factors. The Department of Defense's (DOD) Office of Community Support for Military Families with Special Needs (Office of Special Needs or OSN) is responsible for developing, implementing, and overseeing a policy to support military families who have special needs. OSN is also responsible for monitoring the Military Service's Family Support Management Program (EFMP) and collaborating with the military services to standardize EFMP components as appropriate. In addition, OSN monitors EFMP activities at each installation to ensure that they comply with DOD's policy. The Office of Special needs was established by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2010 to develop, implement, and oversee a policy for military families withspecial needs. Among other things, this policy must include requirements for resources and staffing to ensure appropriate numbers of case managers are available to develop and maintain services plans that support these families and include requirements regarding the development and continuous updating of a services plan for each military family with special need. In April 2019, DOD stated that it was exploring legislative changes to the law that would require a services plans to be developed and updated only for those families who request services, but this proposal was not included in the NDAA for fiscal year 2020. The Military Services and OSN provided a number of reasons as to why they do not develop and maintaining services plans for each family. For example, Air Force officials said they first consider whether a plan will help each family receive the required services, and Army and Marine Corps officials said that they may not develop a plan if a family does not request it. OS N officials also said that some installations may not have the staff needed to develop the plans, and that some families' circumstances did not require a plan. In a May 2018 GAO report, DOD reported that OSN has several efforts under way to improve the oversight of its EFMP, but lacks a way to fully assess performance across the military Services and a process for evaluating their monitoring activities. In that report, we found that DOD lacked common performance measures for family support and assignment coordination and recommended that DOD direct OSN to develop common performance metrics for these activities, in accordance with leading practices for performance measurement. DOD concurred with our recommendation, but has not yet fully implemented it. DOD last commented on this recommendation in April 2019 and said the family support component is monitored and evaluated through each Military Services' certification process, which includes specific standards for the EF MP.
The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 provided up to $10 billion in funding for veterans to obtain health care services from community providers through the Choice Program when veterans faced long wait times, lengthy travel distances, or other challenges accessing care at VA medical facilities. Legislation enacted in April, August, and December of 2017 and June 2018 extended the program and provided an additional $9.4 billion for the Veterans Choice Fund. The VA MISSION Act of 2018, among other things, requires VA to establish a permanent community care program no later than 1 year after passage of the Act (June 6, 2019) and authorizes VA to utilize a claims processing process (TPA) for claims processing. VA refers to the consolidated program as the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP). The VCCP will be similar to the current Choice Program in certain respects, such as establishing regional networks of community providers and processing and paying those providers' claims. However, unlike the Choice program, VA is planning to have medical facilities—not the TPAs—generally be responsible for scheduling veterans' appointments with community providers. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which VA has taken steps to improve the timeliness of payments to community providers, (2) factors that adversely affected veterans' timely access to care under the V CCP, and (3) steps VA needs to take to ensure timely care for veterans under the program. This statement is based on GAO's prior work issued from June 2018 through September 2018. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed VA documents and interviewed VA officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program) TPA processes claims it receives from community health care providers for the care they deliver to veterans and pays providers for approved claims. To be reimbursed for its payments to providers, the TPA in turn submits electronic invoices—or requests for payment—to VA. The TPA generates an invoice for every claim it receives and either approves or rejects them. Invoices may be rejected, for example, if care provided was not authorized. Approved invoice are paid, whereas rejected invoiced are returned to TPA. GAO found that VA has made progress in making timely claims payments to the providers. According to VA data, as of July 2018, VA was paying at least 90 percent of theTPAs' invoicing within 7 days, a significant increase from the 50 percent timely payments VA made to TPAs between November 2014 and September 2016. In addition, VA and the TP as had taken steps, including amending certain reimbursement requirements and improving provider education, to help providers resolve claims processing issues. For example, VA updated its payment system and related processes to pay TPAs more quickly. In a September 2018 report (GAO-18-611R), GAO identified three key factors that affected timelier payments to VA's TPAs and that, if unaddressed, could affect provider payment timeliest for the VA Choice Program. These factors included ( 1) VA's untimely payments to TP as, which in turn extended the length of time TPAs took to pay community providers' claim claims; ( 2) Choice Program reimbursement requirements, which led to claim denials; and ( 3) inadequate provider education on filing claims. VA has not fully addressed two of these factors. First, VA does not have complete data allowing it to effectively monitor adherence with its policy for medical facilities to perform timely reviews and approvals of secondary authorization requests, which community providers request when veterans need services that exceed the period or scope of the original authorization. As a result, community providers may have to delay care or deliver care that is not authorized, which increases the likelihood that claims will be denied and the providers will not be paid. Second, VA lacks complete and reliable data to systematically monitor veterans' access to Choice Program care because it lacks complete, reliable data on the time it takes for providers to prepare veterans' referrals and send them to the VA medical facility for care. VA is taking steps to address these data limitations, but it will need to do so in order to ensure that veterans' care is delivered in a timely and accurate manner. VA also needs to address other factors that have adversely affected care delivery for veterans through the program, including administrative burden caused by complexities of VA's referral and appointment scheduling processes, poor communication between VA and its medical facilities, and inadequ
USDA and FDA share oversight of nearly all the nation's food supply but do not regulate most date labels and are not required to do so by federal law. As a result, consumers may be confused about the meaning of date labels on packaged foods, which may lead to food waste. GAO was asked to review issues related to date labels. This report examines (1) the extent to which USDA and FDA have taken steps to address consumer confusion about date labels, (2) the federal and nonfederal roles related to the use and regulation of date labeling, and (3) the steps USDA and the agencies have taken to coordinate with each other and other stakeholders on date labeling. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed officials from USDA, FDA, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). GAO also reviewed documents related to USDA's and FDA's efforts to reduce food loss and waste. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have taken a number of steps to help consumers understand date labels for packaged foods. For example, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued guidance to consumers and industry, promulgated regulations and implemented policies, and funded research on date labels in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In addition, FDA has issued information to consumers on how to use date labels to prevent food waste and has supported industry efforts to standardize date labels by, among other things, requiring that infant formula display a specific “use by” date on each container of formula. FDA also published an educational fact sheet for consumers on reducing food waste while maintaining food safety and promoted a voluntary industry initiative that calls for using the “best if used by�” introductory phrase in quality-based date labels of packaged foods to indicate when a product will be at its best flavor and quality. In October 2018, the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services signed a formal agreement aimed at improving coordination and communication across federal agencies to educate Americans about the benefits of reducing food loss. In April 2019, the three agencies announced a federal interagency strategy to prioritize and coordinate their efforts as they implement the formal agreement. This strategy identifies date labeling as a priority action area and states that “establishing and communicating clearer, coordinated voluntary guidance on food date labels” could help increase food recovery and lead to reductions in food waste, according to the agencies. In keeping with the goal in the agencies' Winning on Reducing Food Waste Initiative to expand collaboration with non-federal stakeholders, in April 2019 USDA, EPA, and FDA signed a written agreement with the Regional Food and Nutrition Council (ReFED), an international organization, to collaborate on efforts to reduced food loss, waste, and food insecurity. However, the agencies and ReFED have not coordinated with other stakeholders, such as state, local, and tribal governments, to develop a common approach for addressing date labels because they do not have a specific mechanism to coordinate or consult with these stakeholders on creating such an approach. By developing a mechanism to facilitate coordination with relevant nonf federal stakeholders on actions related todate labels as part of their efforts to reduction food losses and waste, USDA and FEMA could better assure that approaches they take to reduce consumer confusion and resulting effects such as wasted food. USDA agreed with GAO's recommendation to the agency and described current and future actions to implement the recommendation.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) both have processes for investigating and adjudicating allegations of misconduct by employees. GAO was asked to review employee misconduct at ATF and USMS. This report examines (1) the extent to which the components have implemented key internal controls to ensure the quality and independence of their employee misconduct processes, (2) the outcomes of employee misconduct investigations, and (3) the effectiveness of the oversight mechanisms used to monitor these processes. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 on misconduct investigations and management referrals, reviewed agency policies and procedures, and interviewed officials from ATF, USMS, the DOJ OIG, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Office (EEO Office). GAO also randomly selected a generalizable sample of 65 misconduct cases for ATF out of a population of 150 and 100 cases for USMS out of 1,281 cases. The results of these samples cannot be generalized to all misconduct investigations at ATF or USMS but provide insights. The Department of Justice's (DOJ) Bureau of ATF and United States Marshals Services (USM) have incorporated some key controls for processing employee misconduct allegations, but have not consistently documented the implementation of these controls. For example, ATF has a policy for supervisory review of misconduct investigations that requires managers to review investigative findings with the Office of Chief Counsel to propose and decide discipline or other actions, but does not require managers to do so for investigations that involve non-adverse actions, such as suspensions or demotions. USMS also has procedures for documenting this activity in its case management system and physical case files, but did not consistently document this review for its district and division investigations. ATF has also established policy requirements related to timeliness in completing misconduct investigations but has not established performance measures to monitor this requirement. ATF and the USMS have established mechanisms to monitor various aspects of the components' operations, but do not use these mechanisms to fully monitor key internal control activities related to their misconduct processes. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for management to establish and implement activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results, as well as remediate identified internal control deficiencies. ATF officials stated that the scope of the agency's annual self-assessment program does not include key controls related to its misconduct processes due to competing priorities, but USMS plans to conduct an on-site management review at the Internal Affairs division in fiscal year 2021. USM also has two oversight mechanisms for financial reporting, compliance activities, and operations—annual self-Assessments and internal management reviews. However, these mechanisms do not include oversight of its employee misconduct process processes. ATF opened 1,581 misconduct investigations from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018, with the majority of misconduct cases involving management referrals for action. Of these 503 investigations that had final actions reported in ATF case management systems, disciplinary action—suspensions of 15 days or less and letters of reprimand—accounted for about 35 percent of the final outcomes. Also, 135 (about 27 percent) of investigations adjudicated resulted in corrective actions (cautions such as a verbal or written warning). The remaining 120 (about 7 percent) resulted in retirements, resignations, transfers, and other outcomes such as settlement agreements. ATF's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), USMS' Office of Internal Affairs, and DOJ's DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG) have completed 70 investigations of misconduct that alleged management retaliation. Of the three cases that were investigated by ATF, two resulted in the employees being counseled by their supervisors. The third case was investigated by Internal Affairs and resulted in one employee receiving a clearance letter and another receiving a letter of caution, with another two employees retiring. According to USMS investigations data, 26 cases alleging management retaliation resulted in 26 disciplinary actions, 12 of which were closed due to insufficient evidence, and 4 resulted in employees retiring during or after adjudication. The OIG closed 3 cases due to ongoing related cases.
TSA is responsible for ensuring that all passengers, their carry-on bags, and their checked baggage are screened to detect and deter the smuggling of prohibited items, such as explosives, into the sterile areas of airports and onto aircraft. TSA uses a variety of screening technologies to carry out its mission. GAO was asked to review TSA's processes for developing and deploying screening technologies. This report examines (1) the extent to which TSA has a process for developing explosives detection standards for screening technologies in response to emerging threats; (2) how TSA operationalizes detection standards to update detection capabilities; (3) how much TSA has considered risk when deploying technologies to commercial airports; (4) how well TSA ensures screening technologies meet detection requirements after deployment; and (5) TSA's estimated expenditures to purchase, deploy, install, and maintain its screening technologies as of the end of fiscal year 2018. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed TSA documents, interviewed TSA officials, and conducted site visits to seven commercial airports selected to reflect a range of airport categories, technologies, and geographic diversity. The results of these site visits cannot be generalized to all commercial airports, but they provided important context about the installation, use, and maintenance of TSA screening technologies across the different types of airports that TSA secures. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is developing a new explosives detection standard to address emerging, credible threats involving a homemade explosive, which is designed to cause destruction when used in improvised explosive devices (see figure below). GAO's review of TSA's steps to develop detection standards from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 found that TSA and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) did not document all key decisions—those that could potentially affect outcomes—regarding the testing and analyses (characterization) of explosive threat materials and the development of detection standards. For example, in five of the seven material threat assessments GAO examined, TSA and S&T did not consistently document how selected samples were prepared for testing. By documenting key decisions, TSA could better ensure that effective decisions are made and that organizational knowledge is retained regardless of changes in personnel. TSA officials said one way to operationalize detection standards—acquire and deploy technologies to update capabilities to meet the standard—is to update existing screening systems with new technology. When possible, the agency installs software as part of routine maintenance. TSA can also deploy new hardware or replace screening systems to update screening capabilities. According to officials, updating existing screening technologies can take years to complete. As of August 2019, all fully deployed TSA technologies had detection capabilities that met detection standards that were approved from 2006 through 2012. However, for each screening technology, TSA has approved two to three new standards that have not been operationalized. TSA has not updated its guidance for developing new detection standards since December 2015 to reflect key changes in its procedures, roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders, and organizational changes. Officials told GAO that they had begun revising the guidance to reflect existing standard operating procedures for developing detection standards, but had yet to finalize a draft of the new guidance or document plans or timeframes for completing and approving it. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides that agencies should identify, on a timely basis, significant changes to internal conditions that have already occurred. By updating its guidance, TSA would have better assurance that detection standards are developed in accordance with established policies and practices. TSA's deployment decisions are generally based on logistical factors, including the number of units of a technology the agency deploys to an airport, the order in which it deploys them, and where they are deployed. TSA generally deploys screening technologies based on a number of logistical factors aimed at maximizing the operational efficiency of the screening process. TSA practices do not ensure that screening technologies continue to meet detection standards after they have been deployed to airports. TSA does not have a process in place to ensure that deployed screening technologies are meeting detection requirements. TSA considers risk when deciding whether to invest in a new technology to address an identified capability gap, but it is unclear how much risk is considered when determining where and in what order to deploy technologies. DHS guidance for homeland security risk management calls for risk to be considered consistently and comprehensively in all aspects of an agency's work. By fully disclosing what risk factors are weighed and how decisions were made, TSA officials can better ensure their deployment of technologies matches potential risks (threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences).
The Coast Guard's shore infrastructure includes more than 20,000 buildings and structures that are vital to the agency's ability to carry out its missions, such as maritime safety, search and rescue, and the nation's ports and waterways. The Coast Guard faces recapitalization, new construction, and deferred maintenance backlogs for its shore infrastructure totaling at least $2.6 billion as of 2018 and backlogs increased by $300 million since fiscal year 2012. GAO was asked to review Coast Guard shore infrastructure. This report examines the extent to which the Coast Guard has (1) taken actions to improve the resilience of its shore facilities and (2) assessed the vulnerability of its facilities to natural disasters. To do this work, GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents and interviewed Coast Guard officials. The U.S. Coast Guard, a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has rebuilt or relocated at least 15 storm-damaged shore facilities since 2005 and is conducting a vulnerability assessment of selected buildings to determine which are vulnerable to disasters. Specifically, from December 2005 through June 2019, the agency was appropriated about $2 billion in supplemental funds to, among other things, rebuild or relocate 15 facilities damaged by hurricanes. During this time, it has relocated facilities further inland or to higher ground, upgraded facilities to be more resilient and designed new facilities with features to protect them from natural disasters, and developed new guidance to increase the likelihood that new or recapitalized buildings will withstand natural disasters and follow updated state and local building codes, which a senior Coast Guard official told GAO led to more resilient buildings, thus limiting risks to Coast Guard personnel and operations. The 2016 and 2017 hurricane seasons were particularly destructive, and in 2017 the agency received $719 million in supplemental funding to restore facilities damaged in Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Maria. In addition, in 2015, Coast Guard civil engineering program officials initiated a formal assessment of owned and occupied Coast Guard buildings to assess their vulnerability to disasters, which, according to agency officials, they aim to complete in 2025. However, the process did not identify all assets that are critical to its missions or screen them for all vulnerabilities, as recommended by the DHS Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Framework, and it has not analyzed the potential consequences of damage to the infrastructure that it identified as vulnerable. For example, it did not assess the economic losses associated with potential catastrophic disasters or long-term costs for rebuilding assets or taking other actions to respond to and recover from these events. As it begins to conduct its second phase of its vulnerability assessment in September 2018, it is unclear whether it will include information on potential consequences in its assessment. The agency's processes to improve shore infrastructure resilience do not fully align with the five steps of the DHS critical infrastructure risk management framework, which is intended to guide decision making and prioritize actions to more effectively achieve desired outcomes. The framework calls for organizations to (1), set goals and objectives, (2), identify infrastructure, (3) assess and analyze risk, (4) implement risk management activities, and (5) measure the effectiveness of actions taken to address identified risks. While GAO's review of four key Coast Guard plans related to shore infrastructure showed that some of these documents refer to resilience and identify it as an important factor to its operational success, none of the documents identified a measurable goal or objective for improving resilience. Instead, the documents either include goals related to management of the shore infrastructure program, or include no goals at all. By defining risk management goals and expressing them in terms of the objectives and outcomes the organization intends to accomplish, stakeholders, including those at all levels of government and the private sector, would be better able to tailor their risk management programs to address infrastructure resilience needs.
In December 2014, Congress enacted the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act of 2014 (FITARA) to reform the government-wide management of information technology (IT). Among other things, FITARA required agencies to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve their security posture, and achieve cost savings. OMB established DCOI in August 2016 to provide oversight of these efforts. GAO was asked to review agencies' efforts to consolidate and optimize their data centers. This report addresses (1) agencies' progress on data center closures and the related savings that have been achieved, and agencies' plans for future closures and savings, and (2) agencies progress against OMBs data center optimization targets. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data center inventory documentation from the 24 agencies participating in OMB’s Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI). GAO also analyzed OMB data and interviewed OMB officials. As in previous years, the 24 participating agencies continued to report progress in closing unneeded data centers and achieving related cost savings in fiscal year 2019. Almost all of the agencies met, or planned to meet, the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) fiscal year (FY) 2019 data center closure targets. Specifically, agencies reported that they closed a total of 102 data centers in FY 2019, as of August 2019, and planned to close an additional 184 by the end of FY 2019. Agencies also reported achieving $241.5 million in total planned savings for FY 2019 as a result of these closures. However, the agencies did not report their planned and achieved FY 2019 savings. For FY 2020, 12 agencies reported plans to achieve about $264 million in savings. In addition, OMB recently revised its data center performance metrics to focus on key areas where agencies can make meaningful improvements and achieve further cost savings through optimization, such as virtualization, server utilization, advanced energy metering, and virtualization. For three of these metrics, 19 agencies reported meeting OMB's FY 2019 optimization targets identified on the IT Dashboarda public website that provides information on federal agencies’ major IT investmentsas of September 2019. Of the remaining five agencies, the Department of Justice had not established a target for the server utilization metric and, therefore, did not have a basis to measure and report progress. For the other two metrics, the Departments of Education and Housing and Urban Development and the Social Security Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had not yet established targets, but planned to do so by FY 2020. In June 2019, O MB revised its DCOOI guidance to require agencies to stop reporting on spaces not designed to be data centers (i.e., non-tiered data centers) as part of their inventory. As a result, agencies are no longer required to report on about 2,000 smaller facilities, some of which are considerable in size and will continue to operate. While OMB previously acknowledged that these types of facilities inefficiently consume resources and pose security risks, agencies no longer report these locations in their inventories. Further, there is currently no documentation of OMB decisions on agency requests to remove these facilities from reporting, or to exempt them from closure targets because the facility is mission critical. By no longer reporting these facilities as data centers, agencies may lose track of the security vulnerabilities that these facilities present due to the consequent reduction in overall visibility and oversight into all data centers that OMB has identified as potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks. GA OMB also revised its optimization performance metrics in June 2019. While all four of the metrics met three of the five characteristics of an effective metricthat is, each was clearly defined, objectively measurable, and aligned with internal and external requirementsthey did not fully meet the two other characteristicsnamely they did not include appropriate performance parameters and did not full include all the information that would allow them to be understood at all levels of the organization. For example, the virtualization metric requires an agency to report the number of its virtual hosts, but does not relate that to the overall number of servers and mainframes at the agency. In both these cases, percentages cannot be calculated to determine progress. Staff at OMB stated that the lack of performance parameters for the metrics is due to OMB and the agencies needing time to collect baseline data before making changes to the metrics. Until OMB addresses missing information from the optimization
Private health insurance is the leading source of health coverage in the United States. While the majority of health insurance coverage is provided through the small or large group market, Americans without access to group health coverage may choose to purchase it directly from an issuer through the individual market. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established health insurance exchanges in each state to allow consumers to compare and select health plans from issuers participating in the exchanges. GAO was asked to review states' health insurance markets and exchanges. This report examines (1) recent trends in the overall and small group markets for individual health insurance and (2) trends in states' individual market exchanges and the largest issuers in these markets from 2015 through 2017. To do this work, GAO analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on the number of issuers, market share, and number of states' exchanges in 2015 and 2016, the most recent years for which GAO had complete data at the time of GAO's review; reviewed laws, regulations, and other documents; and interviewed officials from CMS, state officials, and issuers. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate. Overall individual health Insurance Markets and Exchanges generally remained concentrated in recent years, with increasing Concentration in many states' Exchanges. States' overall individual insurance markets were generally concentrated among a small number of health insurers in 2016, with three or fewer issuers holding 80 percent or more of the market in about three-quarters of states. The remaining issuers often had significantly smaller market shares—on average, 5 of the 8 issuers held less than 5 percent market share. In addition, in over half of states, a single issuer held at least 50 percent of the overall market in 2016. The largest issuer position was held by the same company in more than half of the states in both 2016 and 2015. Exchanges were also concentrated in most states and in many cases became more concentrated. For example, in 32 of the 49 states, the average market share of the largest exchange issuer across the states' rating areas increased between 2015 and 2017, with a median increase of 13 percentage points. In some states, such as Ohio, the largest issuer was the only issuer in the exchange and thus held 100 percent of market share in 2017. In the remaining 17 states, however, the market shares of the three largest exchange issuers decreased from 2015 to 2017, and in some states these decreases were significant—for example, Maine's market share decreased by 40 percentage points, from 89 percent in 2015 to 49 percent in 2017 (see fig.). Exchanges also remained highly concentrated in states that were highly concentrated—that is, where at least 80 percent of exchange market shares were held by three or more issuers—in 2014, the last year for which data were available when GAO reported in 2014. In 2016, states' Small Group Health Options Program (SHOP) Exchanges remained concentrated, with only slight overall changes in issuer participation or market share from 2014 to 2017. Further, as a proportion of the Overall Small Group Market, SHOP exchanges had little enrollment—typically less than 1 percent of overall small group market—in most states.
In a January 2017 Presidential Memorandum, the Trump Administration reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, directing the Secretary of State to implement a plan to extend the requirements of the reinstated policy to all global health assistance furnished by all U.S. departments or agencies to the extent allowable by law. The policy, later renamed the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy, applies to billions of dollars in annual global health aid—such as HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, and malaria—rather than only family planning and reproductive health assistance, which received about $560 million in GHP funding in fiscal year 2018. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the PLGHA policy. This report examines (1) awards subject to the policy, and (2) planned funding for awards involving NGOs that declined to accept the terms and conditions of the policy. To do this work, GAO analyzed data from the Departments of State (State), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Defense (DOD), and USAID on all relevant awards that were active in May 2017 or awarded through September 30, 2018, and planned funding that was not obligated as of that date. To identify awards in which non-governmental organizations (NGOs) declined the terms or conditions of this policy and the amount of planned funding not obligated under these awards as of the end of fiscal year (FY), GAO also interviewed representatives of Marie Stopes International and the International Planned Parenthood Federation—two prime awardees that declined the two largest of the six prime awards declined and their local affiliates were implementers of many of the sub-awards that were declined. As of September 2018, agencies reported that over $8 billion of the more than $12 billion in estimated planned funding (over 66 percent) for awards that had not yet been obligated under the PLgHA policy was for awards in Africa. Of these, over $6 billion was for global health awards in the top 10 countries receiving the most planned funding, and over $2.4 billion was in South Africa. USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had the most awards and planned funds subject to this policy, representing more planned funding than other agencies. The estimated total value of these 1,309 awards was almost $29 billion across multiple fiscal years, of which about $12.2 billion was not yet obligated. The remaining planned funding was expected to be obligated by FY 2019 and is subject to acceptance of the terms of the new policy upon acceptance of its terms. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) reported that it had awarded all but one of the 54 projects in which NGOs declined the policy's terms and condition, resulting in an estimated $94 million in planned funds that were not obligated, as of FY 2018. CDC identified one prime award in which an NGO declined toaccept the policy conditions. In addition, USAID identified 47 global health subawards in which foreign NGOs declined to acceptance the policy term and conditions and thus ceased receiving U. S. funding under those awards. The planned funds not obligated for these awards amounted to about $51 million. The majority of these planned funds were in the global health areas of family planning, reproductive health, tuberculosis, and nutrition.
The Department of Energy (DOE) manages 57.2 metric tons (MT) of surplus plutonium that it has declared surplus to defense needs. In 1997, DOE established the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Program to dispose of this plutonium at the end of the Cold War. In 2000, the United States and Russia entered into the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA), each agreeing to dispose at least 34 MT of plutonium at a rate of at least 2 MT per year. In 2002, DOE announced it would construct the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina to convert surplus plutonium to plutonium oxide for dilution and disposal. However, the MFFF was canceled in 2012 due to cost and schedule overruns. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review DOE's disposition strategies for surplus plutonium. This report (1) determines the amount of plutonium in DOE's inventory that could be converted to oxide and (2) examines DOE's capacity to produce oxide. GAO reviewed relevant DOE documents and interviewed officials from DOE, including from NNSA and EM, and visited the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico to review past and current inventories of plutonium. DOE could convert 43.8 MT, or about 77 percent, of the surplus plutonium in its inventory to oxide because this plutonium is in a metal form suitable to oxidation. Most of this surplus plutonium metal—33.3 MT—is in the form of pits and is managed by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Management (EM). NNSA's 2018 conceptual plan calls for converting 26.2 MT of this metal to oxide by 2045. In September 2019, NNSA approved a short-term plan to produce a total of 1.2MT of plutonium oxide from 2019 through 2025 at LANL. NNSA officials said that they are reevaluating the agency's long-term plutonium oxide production goals in the 2018 plan because of two key issues. These issues are space constraints relating to the agencys mission to produce new pits in PF-4 and requirements to remove plutonium from the state of South Carolina. According to agency officials, the agency and DOE are taking several actions designed to allow NNSA to meet the plutonium production goals described in its 2018 plan. These actions include continuing to review plutonium oxide and pit production plans, increasing plutonium storage, reducing surplus plutonium at SRS, and shipping the diluted plutonium to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), an underground repository for transuranic waste located near Carlsbad, New Mexico, for disposal.
FEMA is responsible for preparing and responding to disasters, such as hurricanes, tornados, and wildfires, in the United States and abroad. During the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons, the agency deployed over 14,000 personnel to disaster sites. GAO was asked to review FEMA's disaster workforce. This report addresses (1) how FEMA qualified, deployed, and developed its disaster workforce; (2) how effective FEMA's qualification and deployment processes were in helping ensure workforce needs were met in the field; and (3) the extent to which FEMA's workforce receives staff development to enhance skills and competencies to support the agency's disaster missions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed documentation and data on incident management workforce qualification, deployment, staffing levels, and development; conducted focus groups with members of FEMA's incident workforce across a range of employee types; and interviewed FEMA officials in headquarters and field and regional offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has mechanisms in place to qualify, deploy, and develop its workforce to respond to disasters. FEMA designed and implemented the FEMA Qualification System in 2012 to standardize and manage its incident workforce capabilities through prerequisite experience, training, and demonstrated performance. FEMA uses the system to track requirements for incident management positions and the proficiency level of staff members in those positions. According to FEMA, employees conduct required training concurrently with demonstrated performance so that training builds on previous experience and coursework. A regional or national Incident Management Assistance Team is generally among the first FEMA units to arrive on the ground at a disaster site to, among other things, set up federal facilities, establish a joint field office, and coordinate with officials from the impacted region and other relevant federal, state, tribal, territorial, or local partners. If there are staffing shortages among regional full-time equivalent staff members, FEMA leadership in the region where the disaster occurs may submit a deployment request for additional incident management staff members through the Deployment Tracking System. Once a standard deployment request is approved, the system identifies staff members that match the requested positions, skill sets, and qualification status using a preprogrammed, automated process. The system then notifies staff members selected in a rotational order based on length of time since their last deployment. FEMA did not meet its annual staffing target for disaster personnel during the 2017 hurricane season and faced staffing shortages during the 2018 disaster season. For example, according to FEMA's 2017 Hurricane Season After-Action Report, 18 of 23 cadres operated with 25 percent or fewer staff available to deploy when Hurricane Maria made landfall shortly after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017, including the Individual Assistance, Logistics, and Hazard Mitigation cadres. FEMA took various actions to address the staffing shortages and used new approaches to augment its workforce, including using local hires and expediting the local hiring process in response to hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, resulting in the onboarding of 4,095 local hires from August to November 2017. FEMA also conducted a review of its workforce in 2018 to determine the force structure needed to effectively respond to future disasters. Field officials GAO interviewed said they experienced challenges with the reliability of information from FEMA's deployment and qualification processes and systems to ensure its workforce was effectively deployed and used to meet field needs during the past two disaster seasons. Specifically, these officials reported that qualification status was not an accurate indicator of ability to perform, which affected disaster assistance delivery and created difficulties with ensuring the right mix of staff were deployed and effectively assigning responsibilities. Officials also reported other challenges with identifying and leveraging staff skills, including lack of information about specialized abilities and expertise. FEMA has taken or planned some actions to improve its deployment processes. However, these actions have not been fully implemented and do not fully address the information shortcomings that field officials experienced. For instance, FEMA does not have mechanisms to assess how effectively it deployed staff to meet mission needs during disasters, and GAO found significant shortcomings in FEMA's ability to ensure staff development--which consists of courses, on-the-job-learning, and coaching and mentoring--for the skills and abilities needed during deployments. FEMA officials noted that they have not developed a plan to address these challenges because the issues are multifaceted and they had been focused on other initiatives, suchAs revising force structure targets and streamlining the qualification process. Developing such a plan would better enable the agency to use its workforce as flexibly and effectively as possible to meet its disaster mission needs.
Recent developments regarding internet privacy suggest that this is an appropriate time for Congress to consider comprehensive internet privacy legislation. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force in May 2018, is a set of privacy rules that give consumers control over the collection, use, and sharing of their personal information, and California passed its own privacy law in June 2018 that becomes effective in 2020. However, there is no comprehensive federal privacy statute with specific standards. GAO was asked to testify on its recent work on internet privacy. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which federal privacy laws address the collection and use of consumer information by resellers, (2) the scope of consumer privacy protections provided under federal law, (3) gaps in the consumer privacy framework, and (4) regulatory authorities under current law. To prepare this statement, GAO relied on previously published work in this area, as well as a review of relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance issued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other federal agencies. As GAO reported in 2013 and as continues to be the case, there are no federal laws designed specifically to address all the products sold and information maintained by information resellers. Instead, federal laws are generally narrowly tailored to specific purposes, situations, types of information, or sectors or entities--such as data related to financial transactions, personal health, and eligibility for credit. These laws include provisions that limit the disclosure of information to a third party without an individual's consent, or prohibit certain types of data collection. Federal privacy laws also generally do not address the methods by which, or the sources from which, resellers collect and aggregate personal information for marketing or look-up purposes. The Fair Information Practice Principles state that personal information should be relevant, limited to the purpose for which it was collected, and collected with the individual's knowledge or consent. The current privacy framework does not fully address new technologies such as facial recognition technology, privacy issues raised by online tracking and mobile devices, and activities by financial technology firms. The original enactment of several federal privacy law predates these trends and technologies. But in some instances existing laws have been interpreted to apply to new technologies. For instance, FTC has taken enforcement actions under its authority to enforce the prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts and practices in or affecting commerce, and FTC has revised the statute's implementing regulations to account for smartphones and mobile applications. In addition, some states have enacted laws designed to regulate resellers' sharing of personal information about consumers, such as Vermont's 2018 law that contains, among other requirements, consumer protection provisions related to data brokers. The scope of federal privacy protections for consumers has remained narrow in relation to individuals' ability to access, control, and correct their personal data, collection methods and sources and types of consumer data collected, new technologies, and some regulatory authorities. In our 2013 report, we found that no federal statute that we examined generally requires resellers to allow individuals to review personal information (intended for marketing purposes), control its use, or correct it. We also reported in our January 2019 report that the FTC had not yet issued regulations for internet privacy other than those protecting financial privacy and the internet privacy of children, which were required by law. In February of this year, we reported that FTC does not have civil penalty authority for initial violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act's privacy and safeguarding requirements, which include a provision directing federal regulators and FTC to establish standards for financial institutions to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of customer records. To obtain monetary redress for these violations, FTC must identify affected consumers and any monetary harm they may have experienced, but harm resulting from privacy and security violations (such as a data breach) can be difficult to measure and can occur years in the future, making it difficult to trace a particular harm to a specific breach. As a result, FTC lacks a practical enforcement tool for imposing civil money penalties that could help to deter companies from violating data security provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and its implementing regulations. We recommended that Congress consider giving FTC civil penalties to enforce GLBA's safeguarding provisions.
VA, HUD, and DOL are the federal agencies that provide programs to assist homeless veterans. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to address veteran homelessness. This report (1) describes the challenges agencies and service providers reported experiencing in implementing selected programs that assist veterans experiencing homelessness; (2) assesses the extent of overlap and duplication among programs; (3) evaluates how well federal agencies collaborate to address veterans' homelessness; and (4) reviews what is known about the performance of selected programs. To address these objectives, GAO identified 16 programs that specifically target homeless veterans by reviewing agency reports, guidance, and other documentation and past GAO and Congressional Research Service reports, and interviewed officials from VA, DOL, and HUD, as well as service providers and veterans' advocacy groups. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provided insights on program implementation and performance. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Department of Labor (DOL) have taken significant steps to ensure effective collaboration between the agencies and among local service providers when addressing veteran homelessness, but VA can help local agency staff and providers better collaborate by fully incorporating leading practices for interagency collaboration. For example, VA's integration into Coordinated Entry—a process designed to help communities prioritize people who are most in need of assistance by standardizing the assessment process, defining community-wide prioritization policies, and coordinating referrals, among other things—fully followed five of the seven leading practices GAO has identified for effective interagency coordination in prior work. VA and selected service providers GAO interviewed reported facing challenges serving homeless veterans and those at risk of becoming homeless due, in part, to the additional level of service and support that some veterans need, such as substance use and mental illness, according to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), which is an independent establishment within the Executive Branch charged with coordinating the federal response to homelessness and creating a national partnership at every level of government and with the private sector to reduce and end homelessness nationally. VA officials told GAO that the number of homeless veterans who were 62 and older increased by 54.3 percent between 2009 and 2016 and that this trend is expected to continue. VA also reported limited VA staffing, limited and high cost housing, limited transportation, limited resources (other than staffing), and limited housing availability as challenges to serving veterans. VA has taken steps to address some of these challenges, including creating incentives for landlords to participate in VA's programs and implementing program changes to help address the lack of affordable housing. However, VA and service provider staff GAO spoke with cited broader challenges—not specific to veterans or the assistance programs themselves—as impacting their ability to provide assistance to homeless veterans, including VA staffing issues and external factors such as limited housing and transportation options. VA's Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program (HVRP) and other programs GAO reviewed reported meeting most targets, but some aspects of performance measurement could be strengthened. National level performance data for fiscal years 2015 to 2019 show that five of seven selected programs reviewed have generally met their performance targets. Specifically, in four of the last five years, HUD did not meet its targets for "percent housed in HUD-VASH housing" and "percent housing within 90 days." In the last two years (2018 and 2019), HUD didnot meet its target for "negative exits" for "exits to permanent housing"; however, VA had decreased the target for those years (making it more difficult to meet). The performance measures used for the selected programs reflected most of the attributes of successful performance measures that GAO previously identified. VA fully reflected all six of these attributes and partially reflected one, the reliability attribute. VA measures fully reflected five attributes, while DOL's measures partially reflected two, the clarity and reliability attributes. For some of the measures, however, communication about these measures is not clear. Clearer communication by VA about performance measurement—what performance measures capture and how to obtain and provide feedback—would help VA better understand how their program data are used to measure performance and therefore how to improve performance, which could also help VA assess program outcomes.
The Navy has spent nearly $28 billion to develop and buy a ship that has fallen far short of demonstrating it can meet the minimum level of capability defined at the beginning of the program. FFG(X) represents the Navy's recognition of its need for a more capable small surface combatant and the limitations of LCS. The Navy plans to award a contract for the lead ship in July 2020. GAO was asked to review the program's acquisition approach. This report examines the extent to which the Navy has (1) developed a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between requirements and cost, (2) taken steps to reduce design and technical risk, and (3) streamlined the program acquisition approach to move from planning to ship delivery and fielding quicker than in a more traditional acquisition program. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Navy and DOD documents and interviewed Navy, contractor, and program officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) Navy expects that its current plans for the Frigate Guided Missile Frigate (FFG) will result in a larger, more expensive ship than the Littoral Combatant (LCS), but at an increased cost. To help refine FFG requirements and identify opportunities for cost savings, the Navy used a conceptual design phase, in which it awarded $75 million in contracts to industry. The purpose of this phase was to enable industry to mature parent ship designs and help refine technical and operational program requirements before awarding construction contracts. Navy officials stated that the conceptual design process facilitated dialogue and information sharing between industry and the government that helped ensure FFG (X) requirements were more fully understood by both parties. In addition, industry officials told GAO that one-on-one opportunities with the Navy aided knowledge sharing and provided them with a means to ask questions without concern that disclosing such information could jeopardize their competitive position. The program's design concept requires the use of many existing, more mature combat and mission systems to reduce technical risk. As stated in the approved acquisition strategy, the program has a requirement for all integrated systems to have achieved maturity of a technology readiness level (TRL) 6 or higher. TRL 6 is defined by GAO as the capability to produce a prototype system in a production-relevant environment. Program officials confirmed that, as of May 2019, many, but not all, of the key systems planned for FFG[X] were at TRL 7 or higher, which would be consistent with GAO's acquisition best practices, which include maturing new key ship technologies into actual system prototypes and demonstrating them in a realistic environment before the award of the contract for lead ship design and construction to reduce the likelihood of costly design changes later. In an effort to accelerate the time between acquisition planning and the fielding of ships, the Department of the Navy (Navy) has streamlined the acquisition approach and leveraged knowledge obtained from industry during the early design phase. While the program may benefit from the streamlining efforts, the streamlined acquisition approach required the Navy to submit its budget request for lead ships before the program had a comprehensive knowledge of the potential ship designs, cost, and schedule. For example, at the time the Navy submitted its fiscal year 2020 budget request to Congress for nearly $1.3 billion to fund lead ship construction, it had not completed key cost estimation activities that should inform funding decisions, such as developing an independent cost estimate for the program, and had not received final design review information from the industry teams participating in the design phase before requesting lead ship funds from Congress. The considerable cost growth that GAO has previously reported is common to many shipbuilding programs, as well as challenges in deviating from shipbuilding plans once a program has begun procuring ships, emphasize the importance of having a strong understanding of program expectations to back the initial procurement decision for FF G(X. If Congress authorizes and appropriates funding as the Navy requested in March 2019, it will be critical that the Navy demonstrate that the acquisition program baseline reflects the results of the component cost position and independent cost estimates before awarding the detail design and Construction contract. Recent Navy policy changes have created some uncertainty for Navy cost estimation and analysis activities, which may pose a risk of overly optimistic cost estimates carrying forward in programs. For instance, a March 2019 instruction for acquisition program cost analysis shifts the Naval Center for Cost Analysis's role and responsibilities for cost estimation to the systems commands, which GAO believes, as do CAPE officials with whom GAO spoke, diminishes its ability to independently verify
In 1997, Congress provided the military departments permanent statutory authority to convey, or privatize, utility systems under military jurisdiction, such as those on military installations. The military departments have been privatizing utility systems at military installations since 1988. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's utilities privatization pre-award contracting process. This report examines (1) the length of time to award contracts for utility services and factors that affect it, and (2) the extent to which DOD is demonstrating leading practices to collect and disseminate lessons learned for utilities privatization. GAO analyzed 21 privatized utility services contracts awarded from fiscal years 2016 through 2018, the latest full year of available data when GAO began its audit. GA O reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed DOD and military department officials; and conducted site visits at three installations selected based on geographic location, types of utility systems privatized, and fiscal year of award. The time to complete the utilities privatization process generally took an average of 4 years from the time the DOD component issued a solicitation to when the contract was awarded for the 21 contracts GAO assessed. DOD officials acknowledged that the process is lengthy, but DOD does not maintain complete data on key steps in the process, including when the process to consider privatization of a utility system began and the time needed to conduct acquisition planning. Consequently, it is not possible to determine the entire time it took to complete privatization. For example, the Navy took, on average, 92 months to award its contract to privatize the Naval Air Station Key West wastewater system. In contrast, the Air National Guard awarded a non-competitive contract for the wastewater system at Truax Field in Wisconsin to a local utility provider in about 6 months. In 2014, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA Energy) established milestones to plan and monitor key activities, including a target time frame to complete each milestone, but did not maintain data for the completion of milestones within the acquisition planning phase carried out by the military Departments of the Army and Air Force. DLA Energy officials noted that the time frames for the first three steps of the process—determining that one or more utility systems on an installation should be considered for privatization through when the military department provides a complete requirements package—are determined by theMilitary departments. The Department of Defense (DOD) generally demonstrated leading practices for lessons learned in its efforts to improve the timeliness of the utility privatization process, but is missing opportunities to analyze the effects of its changes and to better share the information with stakeholders. DOD has taken, or plans to take, actions that demonstrate or partially demonstrate four of the five leading practices identified by GAO and others for collecting and disseminating lessons learned. However, despite the breadth of activities performed and planned by DOD, the department lacks key data it needs for further analysis and validation of the contracting process as well as a repository for archiving lessons for future stakeholders to access. While DOD has identified 580 utility systems that may be privatized in the future, having such a capability for others to retrieve archived lessons learned could potentially assist future stakeholders in the privatization process and help further shorten contracting award time frames.
The TSA Modernization Act of 2018 required TSA to establish a public area security working group to develop non-binding recommendations for enhancing security in public areas of transportation facilities. The act also requires TSA to periodically share best practices developed by TSA and transportation stakeholders related to protecting public spaces of transportation infrastructure from emerging threats with transportation security stakeholders. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to enhance the security of airport public areas. This report examines (1) actions TSA and stakeholders have taken to enhance security at airports and (2) the extent to which TSA has developed a plan for future collaboration with stakeholders on best practices for airport public security. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials, airport operators, law enforcement officials, and industry representatives from six airports selected on the basis of factors such as size and location, among other things. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has taken a number of actions in response to security incidents at airports, including the November 2013 shooting at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and the January 2017 active shooter incident at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida (FLL), which resulted in the deaths of five people and injured six others. For example, TSA issued an after-action report on the LAX shooting, which identified recommendations to enhance TSA employee training and preparedness to respond to an active shooter situation, among others. In addition, TSA conducted outreach to all commercial airports in the United States to ensure they have plans in place for responding to active shooter attacks and incidents targeting passenger screening checkpoints, and to report to Congress on the findings from its outreach. TSA also issued a national update to airport security programs in November 2017 that included guidance and procedures that align with requirements of the Gerardo Hernandez Act for verifying that plans exist, and for identifying and sharing best practices, across airports. TSA and airport operators have also taken additional actions to enhance airport public area safety, such as the issuance of the Public Area Security National Framework (Public Area Framework) in 2017. TSA developed the framework following a series of security summits that gathered stakeholders together to identify ways to mitigate threats against aviation and surface transportation public areas, including airports. The Public Area Framework categorized 11 best practices across three key areas: sharing information, preventing attacks, and securing public infrastructure. According to TSA, the framework was intended to be a framework, not a strategy or prescriptive action plan with an implementation time frame. However, TSA officials told GAO that they currently have no specific plans outlined regarding the process or frequency with which they will engage stakeholders in the future on public area Security best practices. By developing a plan that outlines the roles and responsibilities of the working group members, mechanisms for collaborating, and the frequency of meeting, TSA would be better positioned to ensure the best practices cited by stakeholders remain relevant and emerging threats are proactively identified. Aviation stakeholders, including airport operators and law enforcement, have taken actions consistent with best practices identified in the Public area Framework, including those related to attack prevention and information sharing, and engaged with industry association representatives to better understand key efforts involved in securing airport Public Area Areas. Collectively, these efforts represent a group of actions taken by stakeholders to enhance their security posture in airport Public Areas.
Wildfires have exacted a large human and financial toll in recent years, with 159 lives lost and $2 billion obligated by FEMA in response during the major disasters of 2017 and 2018. GAO was asked to review FEMA's wildfire response and recovery efforts. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which FEMA provided assistance to wildfire-affected state and local jurisdictions for wildfire disaster declarations from 2015 to 2018 and (2) what practices, if any, local jurisdictions reported that aided and experienced challenges in wildfire response, recovery, and rebuilding efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed federal, state, and local officials in six California counties that were affected by wildfires in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided a variety of assistance to states and localities affected by major wildfires from 2015 through 2018 consistent with roles and responsibilities in the National Response Framework and National Disaster Recovery Framework. Specifically, FEMA helped these jurisdictions by reimbursing some fire suppression costs, supporting state-led efforts to coordinate the response and provide for the immediate needs of displaced survivors, and helping localities plan and execute recovery. For example, in response to the Camp Fire in Butte County, California, in November 2018, FEMA provided over $55 million to survivors to reimburse them for the cost of temporary lodging and rentals after their homes were destroyed. Jurisdictions GAO spoke with reported practices that aided in wildfire recovery and also experienced challenges that arose in multiple jurisdictions across different disasters, such as the complexity and scale of fire debris removal and lack of local experience dealing with the magnitude of the wildfires encountered in 2017 and2018. For instance, officials from three of the six California jurisdictions GAO interviewed said that FEMA and the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services collaborated effectively during response and Recovery efforts. However, officials in two of these counties said that they did not have the knowledge or skill-set needed at the local level to best identify response needs and relied heavily on FEMA and state officials for resources and training in these areas. Officials from another county stated that neither they nor FEMA were accustomed to the level of destruction in a rural area, which created challenges identifying resources and processes to remove damaged trees from private property, storing the volume of downed trees, and maintaining the few roads available for hauling debris. Officials in one county described being unprepared when they were tasked with collecting duplicate payments for private property debris removal after survivors received their insurance benefits. According to local officials, they were not aware that collection would be their responsibility until about 2 years after the initial debris removal took place. The officials noted that the administrative burden for identifying the affected homeowners and the amount owed and then collecting the payments was significant, and taxed their administrative capacity. They said they wished they had been aware sooner that they would have to absorb this duty, so they could put systems in place. In June 2019, FEMA Region IX—which provides disaster assistance in California—finalized the after-action report for the October and December 2017 wildfire disasters in Northern and Southern California. The report identified lessons learned from both the challenges identified and successful practices. Some, but not all, of these were mirrored in GAO's interviews with California jurisdictions affected by recent wildfires. Among its findings, the 2017 wildfire report identified several areas for improvement, including a lack of a unified information system to track applicants' eligibility for all Individual Assistance programs. FEMA has stated that since the 2017 wildfires, policy changes have been made to address this issue, including adding Transitional Sheltering Assistance program applicant data to the information system used to track eligibility. In addition, FEMA reported that the typical contracts USACE had in place for debris removal were not designed to address the nature (i.e., fire-related debris) and scope of work required. The agencies worked together to rapidly scope the statements of work for the debris removal contracts to provide services to survivors, but FEMA ultimately found that the contract requirements lacked detail and clarity, resulting in additional costs. USACE officials told GAO they had shared these procedures with FEMA and stated that the procedures will help guide future wildfire private-property debris removal operations. FEMA could improve its preparation for potential effects of increased wildfire risks by comprehensively assessing its operations, policies, and procedures. The combination of back-to-back devastating wildfire seasons in California, overall upward trends in wildfires, and several factors that point to increased wildfire activity in the
BIE is responsible for providing special education and related services to students with disabilities in schools in exchange for the funds it receives from Education to implement IDEA. GAO was asked to review BIE's oversight and support of schools' special education programs. This report examines (1) the extent to which eligible BIE students are provided the special education services required by their individualized education programs (IEP) and (2) how BIE oversees and supports the provision of these services at its schools. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and BIE policies and procedures; analyzed a generalizable sample of BIE schools' service logs for a 4-month period between October 2017 and February 2018; interviewed BIE officials; and conducted site visits to a nongeneralizable selection of 30 schools selected based on enrollment and other factors, including special education student enrollment size. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools did not provide or did not account for an estimated 20 percent of the time required by students' IEPs to receive special education or related services, according to GAO's analysis of school documentation. Specifically, schools provided an estimated 62 percent of service time specified in their student's IEP. Of the remaining 20 percent, schools either provided no documentation for one or more services or provided documentation that lacked key information, such as service duration and frequency. For an estimated 18 percent of such service time, schools were not able to show whether services were provided to students because school service logs were missing or incomplete. For example, no logs were provided by schools for 12 of the 138 students in our sample, and logs were incomplete for another 51 of the students. The lack of service logs prevented GAO from determining whether some students were provided their required IEP services. In addition, schools frequently did not include reasons for missing services in their service logs, and their practices for whether to make up these services varied. BIE does not have official requirements on whether and when schools should make up missed services, and it provided schools with inconsistent information on this issue. Further, schools' practices for documenting services varied widely because BIE has not established a standardized process for doing so. In the 2018-2019 school year, BIE conducted targeted monitoring of schools it deemed high-risk for compliance with IDEA and other federal education program requirements, but did not always provide schools with timely reports and technical assistance plans to address their noncompliance with these requirements. In May 2018, in response to a legislative mandate, B IE established a new policy requiring that it select a sample of schools based on risk indicators related to federal education programs and provide them with in-depth monitoring of their special education. However, it sent schools visited in school year 2018- 2019 their monitoring reports in late August 2019—well after its required 30-day timeframe and several weeks after GAO requested the reports as part of this review. Bie officials said the late monitoring reports and the lack of technical assistance plan for schools resulted from BIE not fully implementing its 2018 high- risk monitoring policy. Without timely monitoring reports, schools lack vital information to address areas of noncompliance, including ensuring that staff and contractors provide and document services as required. B IE did not verify the provision and documentation of special education at about 30 percent of its schools in the school year that ended in February 2018. BIA's largest division, which oversees about half of all schools, established a policy for its staff to verify provision of services at only a third of its assigned schools each year because of limited staff capacity. The two other divisions, which oversee BIE-operated and Navajo schools, respectively, reported that they conducted reviews at 100 percent of their schools in 2018. Without BIE annually reviewing all schools' documentation to verify that students are receiving the services required, the agency cannot ensure that all students with an IEP are receiving these services. BIED also has a responsibility to work towards the goal of ensuring that schools are of the highest quality and provide for their students' unique educational needs.
FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of the U.S. food supply, including ensuring that seafood imported into the United States complies with the FFDCA. GAO was asked to review FDA's import alert process for seafood. This report examines (1) how FDA uses import alerts to ensure seafood safety and (2) the extent to which FDA has assessed the effectiveness of its seafood import alerts in helping to achieve its food safety mission. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FDA documents and interviewed FDA officials about FDA's seafood import alert processes and procedures. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has numerous active import alerts affecting imported seafood that address a wide range of seafood products and violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). According to FDA, as of July 3, 2018, these 52 alerts affected 3,765 unique firms in 111 countries and addressed a range of violations, such as the presence of foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella and E. coli and unapproved animal drug residues, among other things. FDA places certain seafood firms and products on the alert and may detain affected products at the port of entry to prevent them from entering commerce pending the importer of record's response. FDA may remove a firm or product from an import alert if there is evidence that the conditions that led to placement have been resolved. For example, a firm may be removed from the alert if FDA determines that the firm has taken corrective actions to address the appearance of a violation and has a minimum of five consecutive nonviolative commercial shipments as determined by a private laboratory hired by the firm. FDA's procedures call for the agency to have confidence that future shipments will comply with the act, but they do not specify how FDA should ensure continued compliance. FDA generally relies on subsequent inspections of the importers or foreign processing facilities and sampling of the firms' products to support its removal decisions. However, FDA does not have a process to monitor whether the agency is meeting its audit goals and expectations for sampling and inspections to support these decisions. Establishing such a process would provide greater assurance that FDA is conducting its expected level of inspection and sampling to support the agency's removal decisions and have confidence in continued compliance with the law. FDA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have established a mechanism for coordinating the use of certain resources, but generally have not coordinated to help ensure that firms comply with seafood import Alerts by identifying potential instances of evasion of alerts, according to agency officials. FDA officials stated that the agency can coordinate with DHS's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in situations that could involve evasion of import alerts, but the agency has not established a formal mechanism for regularly and proactively coordinating to identify evasion. Such coordination could include CBP sharing information that could help FDA identify such instances. FDA has not assessed how well its import alert activities are supporting the agency in achieving its food Safety mission. Under the Government Performance and Results-Oriented Government Management Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), agencies are required to develop long-term strategic plans and establish results-oriented goals in alignment with their missions and identify objectives and strategies needed to achieve those goals. GPRAMA also requires agencies to use performance information to assess their progress toward achieving their goals. FDA is implementing a program to review its import alerts. FDA documents note that the focus of this program includes determining if FDA identified the firms on import alerts during its admissibility screening and took the appropriate action, ensuring the accuracy of data FDA maintains in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and determining whether the reasons for the alerts are still relevant, and ensuring that the import alerts are accurately posted for clear communication to industry and FDA field staff. FDA stated that it intends to develop performance goals and measures for its imported food safety program, but has not yet established a time frame for doing so. Once FDA has developed such goals, the agency would be better positioned to assess how well these activities support its mission.
DOD's DFARS is responsible for developing and maintaining acquisition regulations, which may include implementing acquisition-related provisions of the NDAA. The NDAA for fiscal year 2019 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's process for revising the DFARS. This report (1) determines how DOD implements acquisition- related NDAA provisions and communicates implementation status, and (2) identifies the status of DOD's efforts to implement these provisions from fiscal years 2010-2018. To do this, GAO reviewed DOD documents and interviewed DOD officials and industry representatives. GAO also analyzed the implementation status of 180 acquisition-Related provisions from the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal years 2010 through 2018. The Department of Defense (DOD) has a rulemaking process to change the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), which provides executive agencies with uniform acquisition policies and procedures for acquiring products and services. DOD's Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARS) staff reviews proposed legislation and committee report language to stay abreast of provisions they may have to implement after NDAAs are enacted. DARS staff also solicits input on which provisions may require implementation from DOD components and offices, such as the Defense Contract Management Agency, that have a stakeholder interest in many acquisition-based provisions. DOD staff tracks each of these potential changes in case files, which are referred to in this report as cases. DOD also can work with other federal agency offices to implement an NDAA provision through a Federal Acquisition regulation rule change, interim rule change or class deviation. However, there is no publicly-available summary reporting of the pending regulatory changes or other implementation methods linked to specific provisions. As a result, Congress and other interested parties cannot clearly see the current status of pending changes. DOD has taken action to address all 180 provisions in NDA as of fiscal year 2018 that potentially required an acquisition related regulatory change or another action, and the time taken to implement the provisions averaged less than 1 year. For example, DOD implemented 112 of the 180 provisions on average within 1 year of enactment, on average. Some implementation efforts took longer than a year for a variety of reasons, including reconciling multiple years of NDAA requirements or dealing with highly complex topics. The remaining provisions are either in the process of being implemented or have not been implemented because DOD determined that a regulatory change was not needed. The way the DARS publicly communicates changes to the regulations makes it difficult for Congress and others to determine if a provision has been implemented, in part, because of the lack of a mechanism to clearly communicate to Congress, industry, and other stakeholders the current or expected status of a provision. For instance, the House Armed Services Committee reported its oversight interest in a provision passed in 2013 that was not implemented until 2018, but was repealed in August of 2018.
The H-2B visa program allows U.S. employers to bring non-immigrant workers into the United States to perform temporary non-agricultural work for up to 10 months at a time. Employers must petition the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for a number of workers up to a statutory cap of 66,000 per fiscal year. In recent years, Congress has authorized DHS to make additional visas available beyond the cap if it determined that the needs of businesses could not be met with willing, qualified, and able workers. GAO was asked to review issues related to the visa program. This report (1) describes trends in the demand for H- 2B workers, (2) describes selected employers' reports of how the visa cap has influenced their economic performance and employment of U. S. workers; (3) summarizes proposals for adjusting the cap or how visas are allocated; and (4) assesses how the federal agencies that administer the program sought to meet employers' hiring needs and protect American workers. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed administrative data sets from DHS, DOL, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and other documents; interviewed federal officials; and conducted case studies of four industries in specific locations. Employer demand for temporary foreign labor (H-2b) visa workers increased from 2010 through 2018 as the economy strengthened, according to GAO's analysis of Department of Labor (DOL) temporary labor certification (TLC) data. The number of employer-submitted TLC applications that were certified by DOL increased in each year since 2012, and more than doubled from fiscal year 2010 (about 3,700) to 2018 (about 9,500). Additionally, the number of DOL-certified applications has increased each years since 2012. In fiscal year 2018, about 147,600 DOL certified applications were submitted by employers, representing about a 70 percent increase from fiscal years 2010. DOL has sought to address rising demand for TLCs through changes to how it assigns applications to analysts for review and processing. For example, beginning in February 2018, the agency began to release certified applications sequentially according to the day and time of receipt, which in turn led to a large number of employers with approved TLC's submitting their H2B petitions. In 2018, employers filed petitions for about 29,000 visas during the first five days of the filing period for additional visas, exceeding the annual visa allotment by nearly 250 percent. In June 2019, DHS and DOL issued a report to Congress that laid out six approaches for revising how visas were allocated among employers, some of which were similar to the proposals GAO identified. DHS has not assessed which of the options outlined in the June 2019 report could be implemented by agency action alone and which would require Congressional action, nor has it identified which options have the greatest potential benefit for employers. Standards for internal control in the federal government call for agencies to identify, analyze, and respond to significant change, including change in the economic environment. Moving forward with assessing available reform options would position the agencies to better inform their own and Congress's decision-making.
The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is responsible for managing the nation's nuclear security enterprise, which includes four nuclear weapons production plants, three national security laboratories, and tritium operations at DOE's Savannah River Site in South Carolina and the Nevada National Security Site, formerly known as the Nevada Test Site. In 2011, NNSA awarded a 10-year contract to a contractor to manage and operate two of these sites, the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12) in Tennessee and the Kansas City National Security Campus (Pantex) in Texas. The contractor, known as CNS, is to achieve cost savings through a cost-savings-sharing agreement with NNSA. GAO was asked to review NNSA's management and oversight of the Cost Savings Program. This report examines (1) the extent to which CNS has achieved its proposed savings under the contract, (2) how NNSA has overseen the program, and (3) the benefits of the program that NNSA officials said could be exported to other NNSA sites. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed contract documents and interviewed NNSA and CNS officials and contractor representatives from all five of the other five nuclear security sites. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) Central Nuclear Security Corporation (CNS) has achieved about 80 percent of the $515 million in cumulative contract savings NNSA verified from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018, or about $640 million of the approximately $2.9 billion it proposed to save over the life of the contract. For example, in fiscal year 2015, CNS proposed approximately $67 million in annual new savings, and NNSAverified approximately $78 million of these savings. According to NNSA, the remaining approximately $253 million in savings was not available for sharing between the three parties because it accumulated outside of the savings sharing period. Two key issues—benefits savings and fiscal year 2016 labor savings—contributed to CNS not meeting its proposed cost savings targets and may affect its ability to achieve its proposed cumulative savings. For instance, as of March 2020, CNS officials told GAO that its projected benefits savings would total $399 million, a decrease of almost $200 million from its proposal, due to delays in transitioning to benefit plans and rates and a decrease in employee contributions to pensions, among other reasons. In addition, while CNS claimed approximately $30 million in new labor savings in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 based on a claimed reduction of 283 full-time equivalent employees, but NNSA rejected all of those savings due to efficiencies in other areas, which offset those labor savings. Rejection of these labor savings could result in a loss of approximately $270 million in total cumulative savings through the end of the potential 10- year contract period when factoring in potential sustained savings. However, if CNS does not implement any additional cost reduction initiatives and sustains the savings from all previously-implemented initiatives, it will still save about $1.7 billion through fiscal years 2024. To achieve these proposed savings, CNS would need to sustain all previously implemented savings, achieve about $57 million per year in verified new savings through 2024, and sustain those additional savings. The Department of Energy's (DOE) National Polaroperate and Program Office (NPO) within NNSA conducts much of the oversight of CNS's cost savings efforts, while NNSA Offices of Management and Budget, and Acquisition and Project Management also have some oversight functions. NNSA identified three key benefits of its cost savings program at Y- 12 and Pantex: achieving savings, increasing financial transparency, and funding site reinvestment projects. NPO officials said the cost savings achieved at the two sites are a benefit that could be useful at other sites; however, they have not evaluated how best to use the remaining $13 million in available site reinvestments or developed a plan for doing so. By evaluating and developing a plan on how to aggregate and use these funds, NPO could be better positioned to aggregate these funds for future reinvestment. NSA officials said they are not planning to implement the Cost savings program or anything similar to it as part of future management and operations (M&O) contracts because of uncertainties regarding the costs of implementing and overseeing the program and how these costs would affect the overall net savings. NPSO officials also said they were uncertain about whether the program was exportable to other existing or future contracts, including the program's cost effectiveness, because NNSA had
DOD's FFRDCs provide special research and development services that generally cannot be readily satisfied by government personnel or private contractors. They are managed by various military departments or divisions within the department, called primary sponsors, and are operated by universities, other not-for-profit or nonprofit organizations, or private firms under long-term contracts. DOD's Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering is responsible for managing 10 F FRDCs. In December 2017, DOD began a 3-year pilot program to allow FFR DCs to gain access to sensitive data from DOD's prime contractors. GAO was asked to review DOD's implementation of the pilot program. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD's pilot program has been used and the benefits of participating, and (2) the protections DOD has in place to protect the sensitive data being accessed and the steps DOD has taken to ensure these protections are followed. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed DOD guidance, interviewed DOD officials, and reviewed six FFRD sponsoring agreements. Six of 10 Department of Defense (DOD) Federal Research Facilitation Centers (FFRDC) elected to participate in the Defense Logistics Agency Pilot Program during its first 21 months (January 2018 through September 2019) and enrolled 33 projects in the pilot. According to FFRTC representatives, the decision regarding whether an FFRMC would participate in this pilot program primarily depended on two factors: (1), the data needs of the FFRDA's projects and ( 2) the ability of the project's sponsor to access necessary data without participating in the program. Representatives from the six participating FFRCDCs told GAO they chose to participate because they required access to data sources with sensitive data and, in some cases, lacked viable options for obtaining that data. For example, representatives from five of these FFRDFs said their researchers had identified specific projects for which they were interested in using the pilot to gain control of data from numerous contractors. For the four nonparticipating FFRACs, representatives said the existing processes they have in place provide the access they need for their projects. In cases where they have needed to obtain sensitive data, they have executed a blanket nondisclosure agreement with their primary sponsor and in other cases have executed more tailored agreements with companies when obtaining information directly from a defense contractor. DOD officials said that the pilot has provided a number of benefits, such as the ability to provide a more complete picture of the U.S. munitions industrial base capacity and supply chain resiliency. However, several DOD officials also acknowledged that expanding access of sensitive data to more people increases the potential for unauthorized use or disclosure but said the pilot put in place important protections to help mitigate these risks. DOD guidance to implement the pilot required that the sponsoring agreements be incorporated into the agreements between the FFFDCs and the DOD sponsor, but GAO found some instances where details of the required protections were not incorporated in the agreements. For instance, the agreements did not include instructions for researchers to notify contracting officers if they are contacted about employment by an entity whose proposal is being evaluated and recuse themselves in the event of a Trade Secrets Act violation. DOD also did not have a procedure to verify whether protections were implemented, in part because it has not developed a process for doing so. Standards for internal controls in the federal government state that responsibilities for control activities should be documented through policy and procedures. Without a process that includes clearly defined roles and responsibilities to ensure the protections were followed, DOD cannot ensure that its goal to safeguard sensitive data is achieved. DOD is collecting some pilot information but lacks a plan for evaluation. DOD established what information sponsors must collect about the projects enrolled in its pilot in its implementing guidance to sponsors and notified FFRSCs about these responsibilities. The requirements include: pre-action information to be collected when the project is enrolled in the pilots, which includes basic details about the project, the data required, and planned analysis; quarterly status updates, which include progress obtaining access tosensitive data and any challenges or barriers to access; and post- action information regarding the results of pilot access when the pilot's analyses are completed, which including a summary of how the pilot supported FFRVC research, and any benefits accrued to DOD from pilot participation. However the Laboratories and Personnel Office did not collect information about the results from 11 of the 33 pilot projects. Without complete information, DOD will not be able to effectively evaluate the pilot and
The federal government spent about $1.3 billion to produce, process, and circulate currency in 2017. To ensure that currency is available in sufficient quantities to meet public demand, the Federal Reserve orders new notes and coins from Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) and the U.S. Mint. The Mint also produces coins, including the penny, nickel, dime, quarter, and half-dollar. GAO was asked to review issues related to replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin. This report (1) determines the estimated net benefit to the government, if any, of replacing $1 notes with $1 coins and selected stakeholders' views on this change, and (2) examines what is known about potential cost savings from suspending production of the penny and changing the metal composition of the nickel coin. To address these objectives, GAO conducted economic simulations under different scenarios and assumptions over a 30-year period, and interviewed officials from the Mint, BEP, Federal Reserve, and selected stakeholder industries, including banks, armored carriers, casinos, and retailers. Replacing the federal government's $1 bill with a dollar coin would likely result in a net loss for the government over 30 years, according to GAO's analysis of economic simulations. For the first time, these simulations found that replacing the note with the coin would result in an overall net loss rather than a net benefit. The simulations are based on current data and projections from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Federal Reserve that have changed over time. For example, the increased lifespan of the note relative to that of the coin and the decreased cost to Federal Reserve for processing currency are key factors in these estimates and substantially reduced the relative costs of the status quo scenario. However, the simulations show that the government would incur net losses of about $2.6 billion with gradual replacement and about $611 million with active replacement. In the gradual replacement scenario, more than half of the government's net loss occurs in the first 10 years of the 30- year period. The large net losses in the early years largely reflect the upfront costs of replacing notes in circulation with coins and meeting increased demand for currency. In contrast, the benefits would accrue gradually and become relatively more important in later years. Representatives from 7 of the 10 stakeholders GAO interviewed said they would be negatively affected by a switch to the dollar coin because they stated they would incur additional costs as a result of such a change, such as the need to modify or procure additional coin-processing equipment. Three of the 7 said a switch would be costly because the gaming industry would incur costs for transporting and storing coins and casinos would incur increased costs to modify their electronic gaming machines to accept $1 currency. Most representatives from other stakeholders said there would be no benefit to them from a switch, but 3 of 10 acknowledged some benefits of doing so. For instance, 2 said coins are generally less likely to jam or be rejected by the payment mechanisms than notes, and 3 said that switching to the coin could make it easier for people with visual impairments to identify the denomination. The extent of public support for such a switch is unclear, particularly when doing so would not provide a benefit to government. The U. S. Mint estimates that it would save about $27 million annually, or about $252 million in present value over 10 years if Congress directed it to suspend the penny. The mint also estimates it could save between $21 million and $85 million annually by changing the nickel's metal composition. Because the number of pennies produced and the base metal costs vary from year to year, future changes to production volumes and costs could alter the estimated savings. In addition, the Mint has not taken a position on proposed legislation introduced in the 115th Congress that would suspend penny production for 10 years, but has developed a preliminary plan to implement a penny suspension if required to do so by law.
In 2005, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), on behalf of the IC, established the IC Community (IC) Centers for Academic Excellence (CAE) program to increase the pool of diverse applicants for the IC. The IC CAE program awards grants to colleges to support the establishment of intelligence-related programs at selected colleges. GAO was asked to review the program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which DIA has implemented the program since 2011 and (2) how selected IC elements participate in the program and DIA's assessment of the program's performance. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed officials from ODNI, DIA, and other IC elements. While the Department of Defense (DIA) has continued to implement the ICCAE program by issuing grants to Colleges since 2011, it has not sufficiently planned or overseen the program because it did not fully implement five of the six key practices of sound planning that GAO has identified in prior work. For example, while DIA continued to award grants, it lacked results-oriented goals, an overall strategy for the program, an evaluation of external factors, performance measures, and a plan to assess program performance in order to determine the appropriateness of the goals and effectiveness of implemented strategies. As ODNI takes over the program in fiscal year 2020, it needs to address these sound planning practices to determine whether the program is being implemented successfully and to help ensure the IC has a trusted, diverse workforce with the right expertise. In addition, ODNI also needs to improve IC element participation in the IC program. The program is a collaborative effort that encourages participation among all IC elements, but the current program manager has not established a process to monitor and assess IC elements' participation or clearly defined IC element roles and responsibilities for program participation. As a result, the IC elements are not taking full advantage of what the program has to offer and the program may not be able to meet its goal of creating a diverse pool of applicants. Without a process for monitoring and assessing IC element Participation and addressing IC element Reasons for Not Participating in the Program. The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence is responsible for reporting on the IC CAO program to ODNI but has not collected complete performance measures that cover the entire program and has not reported a complete summary of the performance measures it has collected. Since 2011, the DIA program office has collected some information from colleges to monitor compliance with the colleges' grant proposals. However, the data provided by the colleges varied, and GAO found that colleges summarized this information in their final grant reports to DIA. DIA also reported little of the information that DIA collected over this time period. The annual reports described financial data and provided some description of select college activities, but they did not summarize information related to any of the programs core requirements such as curriculum development, critical language study, or professional development. The reports also did not include the total number of IC internships, conditional job offers, or hires after 2012. Moreover, college officials stated they do not report on performance measures after the grant period ends, which may limit DIAs ability to provide comprehensive data for both active grant colleges and legacy colleges each year. According to Dia officials, the agency is currently developing a plan that would require colleges to report information in order for them to maintain their IC CAe designation after the grants end, but this plan does not address the sustainment challenges that may make it difficult for those colleges to follow these additional requirements. As the new program manager, OD NI may be unable to assess whether factors like program branding or sustainment might affect the programwhich could affect its successwithout a process in place to evaluate the effect of these and other potential external factors.
Federal agencies spend billions of dollars annually to operate and maintain hundreds of thousands of real property assets. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages the FRPP, which is the most comprehensive database of federal real property holdings, containing details for about 398,000 assets (buildings, structures, and land). The FRPP data show the range of agency assets, including single buildings in a given location or multiple buildings located on installations, like a national park or research center, but does not identify whether buildings are public-facing or secure (and thus inaccessible by the public). GAO was asked to review GSA's management of the public FRPP database. This report examines (1) the extent to which GSA has addressed the reliability of the data in the public database, and (2) how GSA and reporting agencies decided not to provide certain useful information from the database. GAO reviewed GSA documents and interviewed officials from GSA, five federal agencies, and 14 private sector stakeholders selected based on size, location, and other factors, among other things. The Public Buildings Service (PBS) and the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP), two GSA offices that manage federal real-property data, did not provide accurate and complete street address information for almost 214,000 of the 305,000 civilian federal assets included in the Federal Real Property database (FRPP). Specifically, GAO found that only about 33 percent of the assets fully met GSA standards for street addresses. For example, instead of having individual address listings, all 215 buildings at the Goddard Space Flight Center had a single listing of "Greenbelt Road," which stretches over 6 miles and many other buildings are located along the road. As a result, someone using the database would not be able to determine exactly where Goddard is. GSA is taking steps to ensure that agencies provide more complete geo-coordinates when they submit data to the database, but has not taken specific steps to work with agencies to ensure they input correct addresses. The lack of correct street addresses can affect users who may be interested in acquiring or leasing assets from knowing exactly where those assets are located. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASTA) required GSA to develop a comprehensive database and provide the public with database access, but recognized the importance of protecting national security. FASTA also required that GSA make the database available to the public to the extent its release is consistent with national security and procurement laws. In that respect, a key organizational issue is how to present data for reporting assets on campuses that are not accessible to the general public. While non-disclosure is permitted, such actions to withhold this information may reduce the usefulness of the database as a whole. The Department of Defense (DOD) takes a different approach for its secure military bases. According to GSA officials, DOD submits a separate summary-level report for public release. Stakeholders' lack of awareness of the Public Database and confusion with other databases limits the database's usefulness. Of the 14 private-sector stakeholders GAO interviewed, eight told GAO that they were aware of the publicly available database. Of these, 5 said they had tried to use it. However, several selected stakeholders--regardless of whether or not they had used the database--cited concerns about the reliability, completeness, formatting, and organization. The Open Government Data Act requires the Administrator to maintain a single public interface online as a point of entry dedicated to sharing an agency's data assets with the public. The public database's presentation issues, combined with stakeholder confusion, could contribute to low numbers of people who accessed the database compared to another GSA-managed real property database, which was released in December 2017 and is updated weekly. In comparison, users access the Inventory of Owned and Leased Property database more often than they access the public Database.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the federal agency responsible for overseeing Medicaid, Medicare, and other federal and state programs that pay for long-term care for the elderly, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities. GAO was asked to review issues related to elder abuse in assisted living and nursing homes. This report examines (1) federal requirements for reporting, investigating, and notifying law enforcement about elder abuse and (2) the extent to which states have established their own requirements for elder abuse reporting, investigation, and notification in assistedliving facilities. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and CMS guidance; interviewed CMS and state officials; and reviewed three selected states with waivers from CMS's requirements for assisted living facility reporting and investigation requirements. In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS noted that federal oversight of nursing homes is not directly comparable to oversight of assisted living, but noted that CMS works in partnership with states to ensure the safety of Medicaid beneficiaries in these facilities. Federal requirements specify the time frames within which nursing homes must report alleged elder abuse to state survey agencies and, similarly, specify time frames for state agencies to report alleged abuse to CMS. In contrast, CMS requires states to establish their own time frames and priorities for reporting incidents of elder abuse. For example, Connecticut requires incidents to be reported to the state Medicaid agency and Adult Protective Services within 2 business days, while Oklahoma requires that initial incident reports are submitted within 1 business day. CMS also requires states with Home and Community-based Services (HCBS) waivers, which allow states to provide Medicaid coverage for assistedliving services under certain conditions, to have written policies and procedures for conducting internal investigations of suspected abuse and to submit findings from these investigations to CMS within 5 business days of the incident. CMS does not require states with HCBS waivers to prescribe investigation time frames or priorities for incidents occurring in assisted Living facilities. As a result, investigation timeframes and prioritization can vary by state. Connecticut does not specify a process for prioritizing incident investigations in its HCBS waiver, but officials told GAO the state requires the Medicaid program to initiate an investigation immediately; whereas South Dakota requires face-to-face contact with a victim within 24 hours if the incident is life or health-threatening. In addition, states may align certain federal nursing home requirements and time frames to assist living facilities when overseeing reports and investigations of alleged abuse. Officials from Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Connecticut told us they align or are in the process of aligning timeframes within which assisted living institutions are required to report incidents of abuse to law enforcement with time frames federally required for nursing homes, and said that alignment reduces confusion, especially among facilities that offer both types of residential care. CMS officials told us the agency is taking steps to gather and disseminate best practices to help states better manage their response to elder Abuse in Assisted Living Facilities. CMS has initiated an effort to more closely examine how states operate their incident management systems, which are used to track reports and Investigations of elder Abuse. In May 2018, CMS surveyed states requesting information on how those states operate an incident management system for their H CBS waiver programs.
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is responsible for overseeing railroads' implementation of PTC, which is intended to reduce the number of accidents involving serious injuries or fatalities by at least 80 percent by 2020. Railroads must have PTC in place by December 2020 to meet the statutory requirement for full PTC implementation. The vast majority of the 42 railroads subject to the statutory mandate to implement PTC--including 30 commuter railroads, Amtrak, seven Class I and four Class II and III freight railroads--are implementing PTC. GAO was asked to provide information on the progress railroads are making in implementing P TC. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing work examining railroads progress in (1) testing and implementing their own PTC systems, (2) working with other railroads to achieve interoperability, and (3) FRAs oversight of railroads. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed FRA and railroad officials, as well as representatives from a nongeneralizable sample of eight railroads and industry associations. Since the end of 2018, some railroads have reported making progress on testing and implementation of their own train control (PTC) systems. Six railroads—two Class Is and four commuters—reported to FRA that they had implemented PTC on their own territories but had not completed interoperability as of March 31, 2019, and almost all these railroads reported being in this stage as of 2018. In addition, no additional railroads beyond the four that were complete at the endof 2018 reported reaching full implementation. Nearly all railroads that are still implementing plan to reach full implementation in the last quarter of 2020, based on railroads’ extension requests. As of March 2019, 11 of the 31 host railroads had achieved interoperability with at least 1 of their tenant railroads in the 227 unique relationships that require interoperability. The number of tenants each railroad must work to interoperate with ranges from 1 to 31 railroads based on railroad reports. For example, Class I railroads average about 18 tenants, while commuter-railroad tenants average about 3. A railroad does not generally start work to achieve PTC with all the railroads it interoperates with at once, but instead a railroad will prioritize its interoperability work. FRA officials told GAO that the agency continues to provide assistance to railroads on interoperability and to support railroads through the testing process. In summer 2019, FRA began an effort to meet with all freight, non-Class I tenant railcars that have to be interoperable with their host railcars to discuss PTC requirements and review their plans to implement their own systems. While FRA has made improvements, railroads continue to report that they are concerned about the amount of time it has taken FRA to review safety plans, which can be up to 5,000 pages in length, and FRA reported in February 2019 that it took on average 331 days to review a safety plan. While it is too early to determine the effect of FRA's efforts to improve the safety plan review process, much work remains for FRA in the next 18 months as 23 railroads will be submitting safety plans in the future. In response to a GAO questionnaire, most railroads GAO interviewed reported that vendor and software issues remain major or moderate challenges for PTC system implementation. Software issues, such as those related to software for locomotive equipment, are often not entirely within a railroad’s control due to the need for vendor support, in contrast to some earlier challenges leading up to the 2018 deadline, where, for example, the railroad itself had more control as it was installing equipment and could more clearly track progress. According to representatives from one railroad, its vendor has consistently had issues meeting milestones and delivering on its commitments. Representatives from a small railroad said they had limited internal resources and had no control over this process, making the railroad's progress heavily reliant on its vendor.
In 2011, the Air Force awarded a contract to Boeing to develop the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker aircraft, which is to be equipped with subsystems that allow for two types of refueling--boom and drogue--on a single flight. The majority of legacy tankers, such as KC-135s, were configured for only one of these two refueling types and had to land and be reconfigured to use the other refueling system. The Air Force plans to spend about $51.7 billion to develop and procure the next generation tanker. In April 2018, GAO reported that the program was on schedule and on track to deliver the first aircraft by 2017. However, the program experienced delays and cost overruns. GAO was asked to review the program. This report examines (1) the current cost and schedule of the KC -46 tanker program, (2) the status of key performance goals, and (3) lessons learned from the program's acquisition approach that could be useful for future acquisition programs. To conduct this work, GA O reviewed program documents and interviewed program officials. The KC- 46 tanker program's total acquisition cost estimate is about $9 billion, or 17 percent, lower than the original 2011 estimate of $51 billion. This decrease is due, in part, to the lack of need to set aside funds for potential design changes. After a 3-year delay from the original plan, the U.S. Air Force began conditionally accepting the first seven aircraft in early 2019. The program continues to expect that the aircraft will ultimately meet its high-level system performance goals. For example, the aircraft is now below the target weight of 204,000 pounds and within the range of gallons of fuel used per flight hour that is specified in the contract. Program officials expect the aircraft to meet all of its 21 performance goals that are critical to the aircraft's military capability and track progress to meeting contract specifications. The Department of Defense (DOD) and Boeing are working to resolve three critical deficiencies related to the performance of the aerial refueled systems that were discovered during developmental testing. These deficiencies are related to contract specifications, which are at a greater level of specificity than the performance goals and could result in damage to some of the aircraft that are being refueled by the tanker. The Navy and Air Force expect that it will take 3 to 4 years to develop design solutions for these issues and a few more years to retrofit existing aircraft. The total estimated cost for designing and retrofitting about 106 aircraft in lots 1 to 8 is more than $300 million, or about $1.3 billion over the ceiling price of the development contract, which was $4.9 billion. In contrast, as of February 2019, Boeing estimates that costs to complete development have increased to about $6.2 billion due to development problems, which included wiring problems, design issues with the fuel system components, a fuel contamination event that corroded the fuel tanks of one aircraft, and test delays. According to the fixed-price incentive contract, the government is generally not responsible for these additional costs to the extent they exceed the contract ceiling price. Boeing is responsible for all additional costs associated with the overruns and is also responsible for correcting any deficiencies discovered during testing. Several aspects of the contract, however, did not reduce risk to the government and further complicated existing program challenges, including long-term pricing terms for 175 production aircraft that were to be built concurrent with developmental flight testing. In addition, the contract did not require Boeing to demonstrate high levels of aircraft performance prior to being awarded production contracts or receiving payment for its work. The contract also did not identify the timing of when production aircraft would be delivered for acceptance. As a result, program officials stated that they did not have specific aircraft delivery time frames to develop detailed plans for establishing operating bases and performing depot maintenance, including training pilots and maintainers. The current and former program officials GAO spoke with identified several lessons learned that could provide insights for future programs considering a fixed price-type development contract or a commercial derivative aircraft.
The federal government has emphasized the importance of ensuring Americans have access to broadband, and a number of agencies provide funding to subsidize broadband deployment in areas, such as rural areas, in which the return on investment has not attracted private investment. As GAO has previously reported, rural areas may have features that increase costs of deploying and maintaining broadband networks. For instance, low population density, low broadband adoption rates, or mountainous or rugged terrain can make it especially costly for fixed and mobile providers to deploy infrastructure to rural areas with an expectation of getting a return on their investment. GAO was asked to review the federal role in broadband deployment. This report examines (1) the extent to which broadband availability has increased, (2) federal agencies' actions to help close gaps in broadband availability, and (3) industry and federal investments that have reduced gaps and improved how progress is measured. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FCC, RUS, and NTIA data on broadband deployment and interviewed officials from these agencies, as well as representatives from selected broadband providers and industry associations. FCC and RUS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration had no comments. The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) annual Broadband Deployment Report shows that, as of 2018, about 94.4 percent of the U.S. population had fixed broadband service available at customer premises with minimum speeds of 25 megabits per second ( Mbps) or higher, up from 81.2 percent in 2012. However, broadband availability is still much more readily available to urban consumers than it is to consumers in rural areas. In addition, limitations with how FCC collects and uses deployment data from providers to measure broadband access overstate the extent of broadband access, a weakness GAO pointed out and that FCC has taken steps to address. As the availability of broadband service has increased over time, some segments of the population continue to lag behind others in adopting broadband, even if it is available, and therefore are unable to benefit from it. Federal agencies have taken action to help Close Broadband Gaps by modifying funding programs and reforming deployment data. For example, FCC adopted new rules that fundamentally changed the high-cost program and expanded the program to support broadband-capable networks in 2011. FCC also updated its regulatory framework to recognize changes in existing technology and potential technologies in delivery of broadband. RUS has also reformed its funding programs to provide funding for broadband infrastructure and deployment, including providing grants and loans to encourage broadband infrastructure in areas not currently served by existing service providers. FCC has proposed reforms to its program administration aimed at improving federal broadband program administration, including the new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, which will provide up to $20.4 billion through two funding rounds, each providing support over overlapping 10-year periods, to expand broadband deployment to areas that have not been served by broadband providers. In response to GAO recommendations in 2018, FCC has begun to address some of these recommendations, including developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete broadband deployment data specific to tribal lands. FCC officials noted that improved data would help inform future funding by more accurately targeting unserved areas. While efforts are under way to improve deployment data and mapping efforts, both FCC andRUS are continuing to move forward with their programs for funding broadband infrastructure. The lack of accurate data regarding locations that are not serving broadband may affect the ability of these agencies' programs to target federal funds. In particular, there was a risk of federal programs subsidizing deployment into areas that already have service, at the expense of an unserved area that does not have any service. Given this risk, FCC and the United States Postal Service each have “eligible area” validation processes that they use to determine if areas are already being served and therefore ineligible for federal support. The agencies use different processes to determine which geographic areas are eligible for funding, and they have engaged in interagency coordination efforts to keep each agency's program staff apprised of key dates and issues in an effort to avoid overlap.
The VAWA self-petition program is designed to protect foreign nationals who are victims of domestic abuse and allows eligible foreign national victims to apply for lawful permanent resident (LPR) status independent of their abuser. USCIS adjudicates petitions filed by foreign nationals claiming to have suffered domestic abuse to determine whether they meet the statutory eligibility requirements for LPR status. GAO was asked to review USCIS's management of the program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which USCIS has established a culture and structure to manage fraud risks for the program, (2) USCIS controls designed to help prevent and detect fraud, and (3) how USCIS addresses potential fraud in the program and provides assistance to potential victims of immigration-related crimes. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed USCIS data on self- petitions filed from fiscal year 2009 through January 2019, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed USCIS officials. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has established an antifraud culture and a dedicated entity for managing fraud risks in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Veterans' Affairs Amendments of 1938 (VAWA) Self-Petition Program, but has not implemented other fraud risk management practices GAO recommends. Consistent with GAO's Fraud Risk Framework, USCIS created an organizational culture to combat fraud by involving all levels of the agency, demonstrated a senior-level commitment to combating fraud and involvement at all levels, and established a structure with a dedicated agency to lead fraud risks management activities. For example, senior officials are evaluated on their ability to consistently identify immigration fraud and adjudicators who review petitions are evaluated by their supervisors on whether they have appropriately identified and described suspected fraudulent activity in a petition. In addition, officials stated that they collaborate and share information to combat potential fraud through activities that include monthly meetings, regular contact through their co-location, and an electronic bulletin board. While these actions are positive steps, they do not constitute an assessment of program fraud risks that would position USCIS to develop a fraud risk profile for the self-Petition program, as called for in the Fraud risk framework. For instance, the framework calls for agencies to identify inherent fraud risks of a program, examine the suitability of existing fraud controls, and then to prioritize “residual” fraud risks—that is, risks remaining after antif fraud controls are adopted. While USCIS is developing fraud-related training for its staff, it has not developed and implemented a risk-based strategy based on the fraud risk assessment as provided in the framework. Such a strategy would help the agency better ensure that its controls are addressing fraud risks, including inherent risks, in the self petition program. USCUS has not applied data analytics as an antIFraud tool for the Self-Petitions program. Data analytics can help USCIS identify suspicious activity or transactions, including anomalies, outliers, and other red flags, in a program's data that deviate from expected patterns, which can potentially indicate fraudulent activity. In particular, data analytics can identify unusual transactions or data entries that do not fit an expected pattern, such as multiple instances of the same variable in program data, which could be indicators of potential fraud. In the absence of an assessment, using data analytics capabilities in theself-petitions program could help position the agency to better identify and assess fraud risks. In April 2017, in response to Executive Order 13768, ICE established the VOICE Office to provide professional services and assistance to victims and family members of crimes committed by removable aliens. The office provides referral information to the ICE tip line and answers questions and concerns regarding immigration enforcement through its toll-free hotline. Data collected from hotline calls in fiscal year 2018 show that 8 percent of the 1,543 hotline calls were from self-identified victims of marriage-related fraud requesting assistance. Of those 130 calls, the office referred 78 alleged victims to ICE's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line. DHS has a referral process for suspected fraud, which may result in a referral to ICE for criminal investigation. Within USCIS, FDNS immigration officers review fraud referrals, conduct administrative investigations when warranted, and, in limited circumstances, refer cases to ICE. According to FDNS data, from fiscal years 2014 to March 2019, the agency created 2,208 fraud referral leads and cases that involved a VAW
USDA's nutrition education programs provide nutrition education to low-income adults and children through programs such as SNAP-Ed, the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). In fiscal year 2018, USDA spent $826 million on these programs. GAO was asked to review USDA nutrition education efforts. This report examines the extent to which USDA (1) has information on participation, expenditures, and effectiveness for these programs; and (2) coordinates these efforts and leverages internal nutrition expertise for these efforts. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed USDA data on nutrition education participation and expenditures for fiscal years 2010 through 2018, the most recent year for which complete data are available, reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance, and interviewed USDA officials. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) collects information on the number of people who participate in nutrition education through its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed) and Expanded food and nutrition education program (EFE) programs, but faces challenges assessing the effectiveness of one of its largest programs. USDA data show that 3.8 million and 436,000 people participated in SNAP- Ed and EFNEP, respectively, in fiscal year2018. However, participation in these programs has decreased in recent years. USDA officials noted some factors that may in part explain these trends, such as the use of social marketing and policy, systems, and environmental change interventions, in addition to traditional direct education. USDA also collects data on participation in WIC, but this proxy may overcount WIC participation because more than 5.2 million of the 6.9 million people who participated were infants or children ages 5 and under. In addition, WIC recipients do not need to participate to receive the program's food benefits. USDA collects national expenditure data for all of its programs but does not have detailed information on how the funding is expended in its two programs with the largest expenditures—WIC and SNAP- ed. For example, USDA's fiscal year 2017 expenditure data show $907 million was expended on these two programs. Since both programs allow states to use various types of nutrition education interventions, information on spending by type of intervention may help USDA compare costs, and with additional information, potentially assess the cost effectiveness of various interventions. USDA has taken some steps to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of its nutrition education activities, but it faces ongoing challenges. For instance, in 2016, USDA completed the WIC Nutrition Education Study, which assessed WIC nutrition education in both descriptive and evaluative ways. Additionally, USDA officials said a new study is underway looking at how WIC nutritional risk assessment tailors the benefit package participants receive, including the nutrition education offered. Several studies have also assessed the cost-effectiveness of EFNep. For SNAP-ed, USDA collects information in narrative annual reports that make it difficult to assess spending by intervention type. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should use relevant, quality information from reliable sources to inform decision-making and evaluate performance in achieving key objectives. Without information that can be compared across states or easily aggregated or reviewed nationwide, USDA is unable to determine whether SNAP-ED is achieving program goals. USDA's national office does not coordinate nutrition education across its programs and has not fully leveraged its internal expertise for nutrition education. Although USDA has a senior nutrition advisor who supports national and regional officials who work on USDA's programs, the advisor's role does not encompass department-wide coordination on nutrition Education. Further, program staff whose responsibilities include nutrition education serve the needs of their individual programs and lack formal communication channels with one another, according to USDA officials, and there has been a loss of staff resources dedicated to nutrition Education in the department overall. Regional officials and land-grant university officials GAO spoke with said that more formal coordination mechanisms to provide leadership and promote cross- department coordination and information sharing could help increase efficiency, maximize the use and avoid potential duplication of effort.
USPS's retail facilities provide customers with access to mail collection, processing, transportation, and last mile delivery services. In fiscal year 2018, USPS's retail facility network generated about $10.5 billion in revenue, or 15 percent of USPS's total revenue of $70.6 billion. GAO was asked to review USPS's nonpostal retail facilities. This report examines (1) the costs, revenues, and non-revenue benefits associated with these facilities; (2) USPS's efforts since 2008 to increase revenues from its retail facilities; and (3) the key considerations of additional non-postal efforts that USPS could take to increase revenue and benefits from these facilities. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed USPS's financial analyses of its retail network from fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the only years USPS conducted such analyses at the time GAO published this report; reviewed relevant studies and USPS documents; and interviewed USPS officials, postal stakeholders, and postal experts selected based on prior work; and conducted a non-generalizable, web-based survey of postmasters who manage retail facilities located in urban, suburban, and rural areas. The U.S. Postal Service's (USPS) retail facilities are not a major contributor to its costs and revenues but provide benefits, such as enhanced customer convenience and enhanced government benefits. According to USPS's analysis, retail facilities accounted for a relatively small portion—about $5.17 billion, or 7.1 percent—of USPS's modified operating costs in fiscal year (FY) 2018. Personnel costs accounted for the majority of retail facility operating costs ($4.87 billion), including nearly $4.4 billion in employee compensation. Non-personnel costs amounted to about $0.30 billion, which included rent, utilities, and depreciation and amortization. In FY 2018, over a third of retail facilities did not generate enough revenue to cover USPS's costs. USPS officials told GAO that some of these unprofitable urban and suburban retail facilities were in areas where rent and utilities were very costly, and the revenue generated was not enough to make them profitable. Stakeholders GAO interviewed cited a number of non- revenue benefits, including enhanced consumer convenience, increased government benefits, and enhanced community benefits. For example, a representative from a postal employee union said that many customers are happy that they can purchase a greeting card and gift card when visiting a retail facility. USPS has offered a variety of products and services at retail facilities since 2008, including passport services, money orders, and stamps. USPS's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has reported that USPS can take actions to further increase the use of these offerings. USPS collects a fee for some, but not all, of the identified nonpostals, but USPS does not track costs and does not make all costs publicly available. USPS also has conducted three pilots since 2008 in which USPS mail clerks have provided non postal services on behalf of other federal government entities, including in-person identity proofing and biometric capture and sharing retail facilities' lobby space. USPS is currently not authorized to provide such services to state or local entities, but it may do so through interagency agreements with other federal entities. In addition, USPS may also lease excess space at its facilities to other entities to generate additional revenue and other benefits. USPS currently leases space in 232 facilities (about 3 percent) of its 8,362 owned facilities to federal and local government and private entities, generating about $29 million from its leases in FY 2018. However, USPS has little additional vacant rentable space available, and USPS officials said they are currently researching the feasibility and benefits of leasing space to entities to place automated teller machines in retail facility lobbies and parking lots as a way to generate revenue. USPS may be well positioned to offer additional non Postal products and Services due to its trusted brand and vast network of facilities, according to USPS officials and stakeholders GAO spoke with. USPS could also offer additional services and products that are not currently offered at its stores, but these services would likely generate little or no revenue and may have other limitations. USPS and policy makers need to consider the benefits, costs, and limitations of potential non-Postal efforts before introducing new efforts.
In August 2016, OMB issued a memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies to ensure that new custom-developed source code be made available for reuse across the federal government. In October 2018, DOD established a pilot program under which at least 20 percent of new custom code would be released as open source software (OSS) under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. GAO was asked to review DOD's implementation of the OSS pilot program. This report (1) assesses the extent to which DOD has implemented the pilot program and other related requirements established by OMB and (2) describes the views of responsible DOD officials on the use of OSS to achieve efficiency at the department. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD's June 8, 2018 report to Congress and its October 2018 memorandum that details the department's plans to implement the pilot and compared them to the six requirements in OMB's memorandum and interviewed DOD officials responsible for managing and developing OSS. The Department of Defense (DOD) has not fully implemented the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) requirements to implement an open-source software pilot program, as required by law. Specifically, the department has partially implemented three of the four OMB memorandum requirements and did not implement the remaining one. For example, DOD had partially implemented the requirement to conduct analyses to consider alternative software solutions. According to the DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO), the department had been slow to develop a policy because these types of changes require significant resources, coordination, and buy-in across the department that will take additional time to address. The CIO also stated that the department plans to update its existing OSS memorandum by the end of the 2019 calendar year and issue it as policy. In particular, DOD intends to work with acquisition and program management officials to define approaches, processes, and best practices to expand software reuse. If the department effectively implements this intended step consistent with the OMB memo, DOD should be able to fully address this requirement. However, DOD has not provided a milestone for when the requirements will be fully implemented and stated that achieving 100 percent compliance is not a realistic expectation. Until DOD fully implements the pilot, it will likely miss opportunities to achieve related cost savings and efficiencies. Further, DOD will not be effectively positioned to ensure management oversight and implementation. DOD officials GAO spoke with reported that using OSS can potentially yield financial benefits and increase efficiency. For instance, an Air Force official stated that OSS is generally less expensive than commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) leading to cost savings. In addition, a program manager from the Defense Information Systems Agency reported that the agency had identified an OSS solution that provided more functionality at less cost than the commercial solution provided through a vendor. The program manager explained that when the agency implemented the new O SS solution, it realized $20 million in annual savings over the commercial commercial solution that had been maintained by a vendor and allowed the agency to develop and maintain in-house skills that would not have been available had they opted to contract with a vendor providing a skilled workforce. Officials from the 11 DOD components GAO interviewed expressed mixed views on managing the cybersecurity risks that could be posed by using Open Source Software (OSS). Specifically, officials from three components expressed their views that security concerns and the lack of a cybersecurity governance process could result in the sporadic use ofOSS. On the other hand, DOD officials from eight components noted that the potential cybersecurity risks posed by OSS were manageable and that its use should not be limited.
TSOs are responsible for ensuring that all passengers and belongings transported by passenger aircraft to, from, within, or overflying the United States are adequately screened. To do this, TSOs are required to undergo annual training. GAO was asked to review TSA's TSO training. This report examines (1) the extent to which TSA has updated and evaluated its training to address risks identified through covert tests and emerging threats, and (2) how TSA updates and evaluates its training and follows leading practices for training and evaluation development. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed TSA training data from May 2015 through June 2019, the most recent data available, and interviewed TSA officials responsible for overseeing training compliance at the headquarters and field levels. The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Transportation Safety Directorate (T&D) updated and developed training for Transportation Security Officers (TSO) in response to covert testing and reporting on emerging threats that identified risks to aviation security. For example, T&D updated its instructor-led course to address covert tests where TSO's failed to detect simulated explosive devices hidden in bags or concealed on individuals at checkpoints. In addition to updating or developing new training, TSA responded to identified risks by developing or updating job aids or briefings. TSA uses established models and processes for updating and evaluating its training, and these processes follow leading practices to develop and evaluate training and follow up on the impact of the training on the job. TSA updates its trainings using a training development process that can be segmented into five broad, interrelated elements, and is typically referred to as the ADDIE model. The elements include (1): analysis, (2): design, (3) development, (4) implementation, (5) and (6) evaluation. In prior work on federal agency training development, we have found that these five elements help to produce a strategic approach to federal agencies' training and development efforts. TSA's guidance and prior GAO work identify various leading practice attributes for developing training, such as that the process is formal and based on industry recognized standards, provides the ability to update training based on changing conditions and, if necessary, quickly, and includes mechanisms to ensure programs provide training that addresses identified needs. In 2018, TSA formalized a set of alternative processes to rapidly develop and deliver training to Tsos. One such alternative is its Rapid Response process, which allows for a response time to the field of 72 hours. Additional options include the Rapid Update/Revision or Rapid Development (Priority Training) processes to allow for a new training to be issued in approximately 30 days. TSA relies on a database that both field and headquarters staff use to monitor TSO compliance with training. According to TSA policy, TSA documents and maintains the training status of all TSAs across approximately 440 commercial airports through its Online Learning Center database. Within the database, TSA records training completion in three ways: 1. TSO self-certify they completed the training activity; 2. A training staff member at a commercial airport will record training completion on behalf of a TSO for on-the-job training; and 3. The database calculates the percentage of TSO at a given airport who are on pace for completing their required training. While TSA has guidance outlining roles and responsibilities for training oversight at a high level, TSA officials at both the headquarters level and the field level told GAO their processes for monitoring training compliance were not documented. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for agencies to document their internal control systems to allow management to retain organizational knowledge and communicate that knowledge to external parties. By documenting its headquarters process for monitoring Tso training compliance--including its process for analyzing monthly training compliance data, the results of its analyses, and actions taken in response--TSA could better ensure its headquarters staff are aware of their responsibilities for overseeing TSOtraining compliance and consistently carry these responsibilities out as staff change over time. Additionally, by monitoring for instances of Tso noncompliance at individual airports across fiscal years in its analysis of training compliancedata, TSA headquarters would be better positioned to determine whether they constitute a trend warranting corrective action at the Headquarters level.
Federal agencies have varying roles in planning, approving, and implementing infrastructure projects, depending on their missions and authorities. Some federal agencies help fund or construct infrastructure projects and others grant permits or licenses for activities on private or federal lands. Agencies that manage federal lands, such as the Bureau of Land Management, may construct infrastructure on lands they manage and must also approve projects on those lands. The circumstances under which federal agencies may need to consult with tribes will vary based on the agencies' responsibilities for infrastructure projects as well as an infrastructure project's potential effects on tribes' land, treaty rights, or other resources or interests. In March 2019, GAO reported that tribes and selected federal agencies identified a number of factors that hinder effective consultation on infrastructure projects. GAO was asked to testify on the findings from its March 2019 report. This testimony is based on that report and discusses (1) the factors tribes and agencies identified that affect the effectiveness of federal agencies' consultation efforts, (2) examples of federal laws and regulations that apply to Native American cultural resources, and (3) the extent to which agencies have taken steps to improve their tribal consultation practices. To address these objectives GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from 21 federal agencies, 57 tribes, and 57 tribes that provided comments to federal agencies in 2016 on tribal consultation. For the purposes of this testimony GAO is highlighting those factors that more than 60 percent of the 100 tribes identified as concerns. For example, agencies' timing of consultation. According to one tribal official GAO interviewed, late initiation of consultation limits opportunities for tribes to identify tribal resources near proposed project sites and influence project design. Agency consideration of tribal input. Tribes' comments included perceptions that agencies consult to “check a box” for procedural requirements rather than to inform agency decisions. Agency accountability. Sixty-one percent of tribes raised concerns related to the extent of agencies' accountability for tribal consultation, stating that some agencies or officials are not held accountable for consulting ineffectively or for not consulting with relevant tribes. In addition, officials from the 21 agencies identified factors that they had experienced that limit effective consultation, including a demanding workload for consultation because of large numbers of tribes involved in consultation for a single project, high volumes of consultations, or lengthy consultations, among other reasons. Agency respect for tribal sovereignty or the government-to-government relationship. Other concerns were related to agencies' level of respect for tribes' sovereignty or respect for the U.S. government's relationship with federally recognized tribes, according to 73 percent of all tribes that commented on federal consultation practices in 2016. For instance, tribes cited agencies' limiting consultation to tribal participation in general public meetings and sending staff without decision-making authority to represent the government in consultation meetings. Agency resources to support consultation. Officials from 13 of 21 agencies (62 percent) cited constraints on agency staff, financial resources, or both to support consultations. For some agencies, this included limited funding for staff to travel to in-person consultation meetings for infrastructure project meetings. For other agencies, the workload was a constraint. For these agencies, consultation was a challenge because of the number of tribes or agencies involved in a single consultation, large volumes of consultation, or the length of the consultations. Agency efforts to facilitate tribal consultation included developing information systems to help contact affected tribes and developing policies to communicate with tribes on how tribal input was considered in agency decision- making, but agencies' efforts varied by agency. Most agencies provided training opportunities for staff involved in tribal consultation to help build agency officials' knowledge of tribal consultation topics.
DOD's prepositioned stocks play a pivotal role during the initial phases of an operation. The military services maintain their own configurations and types of equipment and stocks to support their respective prepositioning programs. Section 321 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 requires DOD to develop a strategic policy and implement a plan for joint oversight of the services' stock programs. GAO was asked to review DOD's management of its prepositions. This report examines (1) DOD's progress in establishing a joint oversight approach for managing prepositionED stock programs and (2) the extent to which DOD's implementation plan for managing these programs addresses the elements required by section 321. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD's guidance and implementation plan and interviewed DOD officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) has made little progress in implementing a joint Oversight Approach for Managing the Military Services' Prepositioned Stock Programs. In 2011, Congress began mandating DOD take steps to develop an approach to joint oversight, and in 2013, DOD issued guidance to include an implementation plan. However, the plan does not address all of the required elements enumerated in section 321, and DOD's various guidance documents do not include all of these elements. For example, the implementation plan lacks a full list of programs, a detailed description of how DOD will implement key initiatives, a description of the resources required to implement the plan, and an approach for monitoring and assessing the plan itself. Without these elements, DOD's current fragmented management approach will continue to exist, which creates the potential for duplication and inefficiencies among DOD's stock programs, and will not allow DOD to fully support the emphasis and high priority that the 2018 National Defense Strategy gives to prepositioner stocks. In addition, DOD has not fully implemented joint oversight because the department's guidance lacks detail and the department has not implemented requirements within other intended joint oversight efforts, such as the working group. Without strengthening joint oversight across the department, DOD continues to have a fragmented approach to its management of prepositioners programs, which has led to inefficiency and duplication among the services. DOD issued its implementation plan on August 29, 2017, but did not formally issue the plan. As such, it does not bear a DOD seal, signature, or issuance number and most service officials GAO spoke with were not aware of the plan's existence. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness approved the plan in August 2017. The plan calls for improved DOD guidance that builds a framework and establishes joint oversight to synchronize service pre-positioned stock programs with DOD's strategic guidance and priorities, and it calls for balancing service prepositionation programs to maximize effectiveness and efficiency while minimizing potential duplication across DOD. The implementation plan includes information that addresses three of the seven required elements, but lacks the detail needed to fully address the remaining four required elements. Specifically, it describes how the department will achieve its vision, desired end state, and goals, assigns roles and responsibilities, and includes a schedule for the implementation of the plans, but does not describe how it will review and assess the implementation plans. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should monitor its internal controls to determine their effectiveness and make modifications as necessary. Without reviewing and assessing its implementation plans, DOD will be unable to determine whether the current plan is helping the department progress toward its identified vision and desired endState for its prepositiones.
In 2004, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established the IPAWS program to integrate the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and other public-alerting systems into a larger, more comprehensive alerting system. GAO was asked to review emergency alerting. This report examines (1) the trends in how alerting authorities use and test IPAWS and their experiences using IPAWS, and (2) actions FEMA and FCC have taken to modernize IPAWS to increase its adoption and the challenges they face. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed IPAWS data from 2012 to 2019, reviewed FEMA documents, and interviewed officials from FEMA, FCC, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, and other federal, state, local, and territorial alerting agencies, as well as industry and academic experts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) use of Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) messages has increased since 2012, but gaps in access to IPAWS for local officials could limit the timeliness of alerts as emergencies occur. Wireless emergency alerts are text-like messages that can be sent to mobile devices in geographically selected areas to alert the public of an imminent threat to public safety, such as a fire, flood, or hurricane. In 2018, FEMA, in coordination with FCC, carried out the first nationwide WEA test in which participating wireless carriers transmitted the alert to their subscribers' WEA-capable devices across the country. FEMA officials viewed the test as a success with regard to the technical execution of delivering a nationwide message via IPAWS. However, officials acknowledged a main lesson from the test was a need to collect data on how effectively WEA messages are being received. Alerting authorities GAO contacted for seven case studies on the use of IPAWS cited benefits and limitations of using the system during recent disasters such as wildfires, a hurricane, a flood, an earthquake, a chemical fire, a power shortage, and a law enforcement event. For example, officials said that IPAWS has a wide reach because most people have mobile devices to receiveWEA messages, and WEA can also reach visitors to their area. Officials also said that it is difficult to write effective alerts within the 90-character limit. FEMA has taken steps to improve alerting but faces challenges monitoring new capabilities and managing pending applications. FEMA is modernizing IPAWS by moving it to a cloud-based data center and modernizing the stations that serve as the main broadcast source for national emergency alerts. FCC has required wireless carriers to implement new or improved capabilities for wireless alerts sent through IPAWS such as the ability to send longer messages (expanding the character limit from 90 to 360 characters) and to deliver alerts in Spanish. FCC initially set a May 1, 2019, deadline for carriers to support all of these capabilities but later extended it to December 19, 2019 to allow carriers to complete testing. FEMA completed the necessary updates to support formal testing in mid-November 2019. FCC is also testing new capabilities such as enhanced geo-targeting, which requires carriers to transmit alerts to areas that match the targeted geographic area, to within one- tenth of a mile, which can result in overbroad alerting, where people may receive the alert even though they are located well outside of the target area. While FCC is responsible for establishing technical standards and requirements for WEA, it has not developed goals and performance measures for monitoring the performance of these new capabilities. Developing goals and measures is consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), which create a framework of goal setting and performance management for federal agencies. Federal internal control standards state that management should define objectives clearly so that they can be easily understood and performance toward achieving those objectives can be assessed. Without performance measures, FCC will have difficulty knowing if it is making progress toward its stated strategic goal of ensuring the effectiveness of WEA. The results of data collected on performance measures could provide assurance that new WEA capabilities are working as intended during emergencies, or could point to areas where performance is lacking and where FCC might need to take other actions such as working with industry to resolve issues, updating WEA requirements, or conducting additional analysis. Monitoring performance is all the more important because of uncertainty about the extent to which all cell phones will be able to receive WEA Messages with the new capabilities, which could make WEA a more powerful tool and possibly further increase its
Sustainable chemistry is an emerging field within the chemical sciences that has the potential to inspire new products and processes, create jobs, and enhance benefits to human health and the environment. However, there are a number of challenges to implementing more sustainable chemistry technologies, including technological, business, and industry-wide and sector-specific challenges. GAO was asked to testify on its report, Chemical Innovation: Technologies to Make Processes and Products More Sustainable ( GAO-18-611 , February 2018). This testimony discusses (1) the role of federal programs and other stakeholders in supporting the development and use of more sustainable chemical processes and products and (2) strategic implications in the field of sustainable chemistry. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, guidance, and literature and interviewed federal officials, industry representatives, and others involved in the development of sustainable chemicals and products. The federal government and other stakeholder organizations play a variety of roles to advance the development, use, and commercialization of more Sustainable Chemistry. Federal programs conduct and fund basic research on the characteristics and biological effects of chemicals, which underpins the development to develop and use more sustainable chemicals. Other stakeholders play similar roles and some additional roles. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency's Safer Choice voluntary certification and labeling program helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions and incentivizes manufacturers to select more sustainable alternatives so they can differentiate their products in the market. The chemical industry conducts and supports research into more sustainable technologies and other activities. Companies and retailers, such as Kaiser Permanente and Target, create demand for more sustainable products from their suppliers by setting sustainability criteria for purchases. Academic institutions conduct research and train the next generation of chemists and engineers. State governments, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations also seek to influence the development or use of the more sustainable technology through activities such as supporting workforce development and developing tools and resources for industry. Stakeholders have offered a range of potential options to realize the full potential of these technologies. Breakthrough technologies in sustainable chemistry and a new conceptual framework could transform how the industry thinks about performance, function, and synthesis. An industry consortium, working in partnership with a key supporter at the federal level, could help make sustainable chemistry a priority and lead to an effective national initiative or strategy. Integrating sustainable chemistry principles into educational programs could bolster a new generation ofChemists, encourage innovation, and advance achievement. A national initiative that considers sustainable chemistry in a systematic manner could encourage collaborations among industry, academia, and the government, similar to the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Federal agencies can also play a role in demonstrating, piloting, and de- risking some technology development efforts. There are opportunities for the federal government to address industrywide challenges such as developing standard tools for assessment and a robust definition of sustainable Chemistry.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers Medicare, the nation's health care program for the elderly and certain disabled individuals and their dependents. CMS uses a variety of quality measures to assess the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries, such as the percentage of patients with a myocardial infarction who receive an aspirin prescription on discharge. GAO was asked to review CMS's quality measurement activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which CMS has information on the amount of funding it has obligated for quality measurement and how it uses this funding to achieve its strategic objectives, and (2) CMS's approach to deciding which measures to use in its Medicare quality programs and which new measures to develop and whether these decisions are consistent with CMS's strategic objectives. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed CMS's funding information on quality measurement for fiscal years 2009 through 2018, reviewed CMS documents, and interviewed CMS officials. CMS maintains information in its core budget database, HIGLAS, on funding for some of its quality measurement efforts. However, CMS's database does not capture all of the funding the agency has obligated that pays for quality Measurement activities. CMS officials identified eight appropriations that specifically designate funding for Medicare quality measurement. These include five appropriations that have funded the consensus-based entity established under sections 1890 and 1890A of the Social Security Act (SSA) to carry out various activities under contract with CMS in accordance with those provisions. CMS also identified three appropriations that focused on more discrete aspects of quality measurement such as developing new quality measures for clinicians and post-acute care providers under Medicare. In addition, CMS identified some funding that was obligated from appropriations authorized for more general purposes but had specific project codes and project descriptions that identified its use for quality measurements. CMS does not know the total amount of this unidentified quality measurement funding, but officials stated that they estimated it was less than the amount identified in the funding information in the agency's first annual report on such funding, issued in March 2019. CMS has not developed procedures to ensure that the quality measures it decides to use or to develop effectively promote its strategic measurement objectives. Federal internal control standards call for agencies to use complete and accurate information and to identify types or categories of information that enable them to achieve their objectives. Without more complete and detailed information on funding, CMS officials cannot accurately assess the magnitude of resources they have provided to quality measurement or determine how possible changes in its funding allocations among those activities could help to promote its objectives more effectively. CMS takes different approaches in deciding which Medicare quality measures that it will use, which to remove, and which measures it will develop. For example, CMS has an annual process for selecting measures to be used in its quality programs, but it lacks procedures for systematically assessing how each measure will help the agency achieve each of its eight quality measurement strategic objectives and has not yet developed or implemented performance indicators to evaluate its overall progress toward achieving these objectives. For measures that are being used, CMS relies on measure developers to monitor the performance of their measures based on principles defined in CMS's Blueprint for the CMS Measures Management System, which lays out the steps measure developers should follow to first identify health care topics or conditions where new measures are needed, and then develop and test specific measures to fill those identified gaps. CMS is also developing a quality measurement tool that is intended to provide a standard methodology to score measures on dimensions that include several of CMS's eight strategic objectives but has not determined how it plans to use this tool once its testing is complete. Without procedures that ensure that its quality measures fully address its objectives, CMS increases the risk that the measures it chooses to use will not help it achieve its objectives as effectively as possible.
The JOM program provides supplemental financial assistance, through contracts, to meet the unique and specialized educational needs of eligible American Indian and Alaska Native students. JOM funds can be used to support a wide variety of supplemental education programs, including programs providing Native cultural and language enrichment; academic support; dropout prevention; and the purchase of school supplies, according to the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). GAO was asked to review BIE's management and oversight of the program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which BIE has key information on the program needed for oversight and (2) the roles and responsibilities of BIE and other Interior staff involved in administering JOM. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed BIE data; and interviewed BIE, BIA, and contractor officials. The Department of the Interior (Interior) does not have key information needed for effective program oversight, including complete and accurate information on which contractors are participating in the Job OpportunitiesOMO (JOM) program. BIE does not maintain a list of all JOM contractors and does not know how many contractors may be missing from its current list of more than 340 contractors. According to federal internal control standards, an agency should have relevant, reliable information to run and control its operations. For example, GAO found 19 contractors that were listed twice, meaning the total number of contractors provided by BIE contained duplicates and was not an accurate count. Further, BIE officials said they have not verified the accuracy and completeness of their list of contractors. As a result, the funding contractors receive may not reflect changes in the number of students served by contractors. The size of JOM contracts currently ranges from less than $1,000 to nearly $4 million, and the Modernization Act of 2018 requires BIE to determine eligible students served or potentially served and to complete a rulemaking process to modernize program rules. In addition, in response to the act, Interior promulgated new final JOM regulations that became effective March 26, 2020. Interior's Office of Inspector General has identified three identified cases of theft related to the program that occurred between 2004 and 2010. Interior has not identified the staff necessary for conducting critical JOM functions, such as administering contracts, reviewing the appropriateness of contract types, and overseeing contractors that are subject to BIE oversight. In November 2019, the Director approved hiring three additional JOM specialists to support the administration of contracts, oversee contractors, and provide technical assistance. However, the exact roles of these new employees have not been determined. Until BIE identifies the staff needed to carry out these critical functions and clearly defines their roles, it may continue to face challenges in managing and overseeing the program, which could increase the risk of potential misuse or abuse of program funds. Interior does not routinely track and monitor the timeliness of disbursements of funds to contractors, which can hinder contractors' ability to effectively manage their JOM programs and serve students. For instance, 27 school contractors did not receive a portion of their calendar year 2018 funding until September 2019, and some of these contractors had not received any disbursement in the 2019 calendar year until August, months after funds are typically disbursed. In October 2019, Interior began efforts to identify and contact officials responsible for all the programs whose contracts lapsed in California due to gaps in the program's administration and began the process to start new programs in the future.
DOD has become increasingly reliant on information technology (IT) systems and networks to conduct military operations and perform critical functions. However, these systems are often riddled with cybersecurity vulnerabilities—both known and unknown. These vulnerabilities and human error can facilitate security incidents and cyberattacks that disrupt critical operations; lead to inappropriate access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of sensitive information; and threaten national security. GAO was asked to review DOD's cybersecurity practices. This report addresses the extent to which DOD has implemented (1) key cyber hygiene practices to protect its networks from key cyberattack techniques and (2) the extent that senior DOD leaders receive information on the department's efforts to address these cyber hygiene initiatives and practices. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed DOD documents and interviewed cognizant DOD officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) has not fully implemented its three key initiatives to improve cyber hygiene—the Defense Cybersecurity Culture and Compliance Initiative (DC3I), Cyber Awareness Challenge training, and Cyber Hygiene Scorecard. The DC3I is a memorandum signed by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 2015 to transform DOD cybersecurity culture by enabling and reshaping leaders, cyber providers, personnel who perform cyberspace operations, and general users to improve individual human performance and accountability on DOD's network. In December 2016, the Deputy Secretary of DOD assigned the DOD Chief Information Officer (CIO) as the official responsible for ensuring that DOD components implemented the DC3i. The CDIP is one of seven actions identified in DOD's Cybersecurity Campaign to prompt commanders and senior leaders to enforce full cybersecurity compliance and accountability across the department. DOD CIO officials told GAO that the office is focusing its resources on other CIO initiatives, such as implementing the cyber landscape initiative, but the DC2I included a task (task 11) that required an assessment of the resources needed to ensure the implementation of the DC 3I and this task had not been completed at the time of GAO's review. If DOD does not take appropriate steps to ensure that these tasks are implemented, the department risks compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of mission-critical information as a result of human error by users on its networks. DOD has not implemented seven of the 11 tasks that were due in fiscal year 2016. For example, DOD components have implemented four of the 10 tasks that the CIO oversees, but have not implemented the remaining seven tasks. The department has not reported on the progress it has made implementing the seven tasks that it does not oversee in part because the DeputySecretary of Defense did not identify a component to oversee their implementation and report on their progress. If the department does not monitor and report progress on these tasks, it will have less assurance that cybersecurity vulnerabilities are being addressed in a timely manner and systems are being securely configured. The Cyber Hy hygiene Scorecard is a report that DOD uses to measure compliance with DOD cybersecurity policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. The Scorecard provides information to the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and DOD component heads about the extent of implementation of 10 cyber hygiene tasks overseen by the DODCIO. However the Scorecard does not include information about the progress made on the other two initiatives. DOD officials told us that they did not include this information because they believed it would be challenging to measure the culture-related objectives in the DC1I. While the objectives in this report may be difficult to measure, it is possible to measure progress in implementing the other initiatives. Without this information, DOD cannot be assured that its networks are being adequately protected from cyber attack techniques that adversaries may use to disrupt military operations.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the use of obesity drugs in the Medicare and non-Medicare populations, including spending for and coverage of these drugs. GAO examined (1) the prevalence of obesity among adults in the United States; (2) what is known about the use and the individuals who use obesity drugs; (3) health insurance coverage of obesity drug use; and (4) spending on obesity drugs and medical spending for adults who used obesity drugs compared to those who did not. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality's Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Sentinel System, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Event data, and Medicaid State Drug Utilization data from CMS, and reviewed relevant literature and documents from stakeholder organizations, federal agencies, insurers, and others. According to nationally representative estimates from CDC, from 2013 through 2016, there was a prevalence of about 38 percent of all U.S. adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher who were overweight or obese (defined as a BMI of 25 to <30). CDC estimates also showed that about 24 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had Class 1 obesity, about 10 percent had Class 2 obesity, and about 6 percent of Class 3, or severe, obesity. CDC's estimates also found that adults age 18 to 64 and adults age 65 and older had a similar prevalence of obese, about 39 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Relatively few adults, including adults with obesity and adults who reported trying to lose weight, used obesitydrugs from 2012 through 2016. For example, fewer than a million adults used any of the nine obesity drugs that were approved by FDA to treat obesity from 2012 to 2016, according to AHRQ's nationally representative MEPS data for 2012-2016. Some limited data are available on individuals who have used these drugs, including data on whether these individuals adhered to taking the prescribed obesity drug or maintained their weight loss over time. For adults who did and did not use any of these obesity drugs, the estimated average annual medical and prescription drug spending per adult was higher for those who used an obesity drug than for others who did. For those who had used an Obesity Drug in 2016 and 2017, the average annual average medical expenditures per adult were $7,575 per adult and $4,302 per adult who had not used any obesity drug. However, the differences in these estimates do not establish any causal relationship between using these drugs and having higher average annual estimated medical or prescription drug expenditures. HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.
In September 2017, two Category 5 hurricanes struck the USVI, causing catastrophic damage across the entire territory and neighboring Caribbean islands. In response to the Governor's request, the President declared each of the storms a major disaster, which triggered a variety of federal response and recovery programs for government and nongovernmental entities and households and individuals, including assistance through the Public Assistance program. This program provides funding to state, territorial, local, and tribal governments as well as certain types of private nonprofit organizations to assist with responding to and recovering from major disasters or emergencies. As of October 1, 2018, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had obligated more than $1.4 billion in Public Assistance funding for 475 projects across the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). The USVI had expended about $586.9 million of this funding to reimburse subrecipients for completed work. GAO was asked to review FEMA's Public Assistance programs. This report examines (1) the amount of funding FEMA obligated and the funding expended as of October 2018, (2) the status of FEMA's transition to using Public Assistance alternative procedures for permanent work projects, and (3) the extent to which FEMA has used alternative procedures to provide flexibility in awarding Public Assistance funds. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed FEMA documents and interviewed FEMA and USVI officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. FEMA and the US VI government did not provide comments on this report. FEMA had obligated over $1,4 billion and the United States Virgin Islands had expended approximately $587 million in public assistance funding through the standard Public Assistance Program (the standard program is funded through FEMA's annual appropriation) for 475 disaster-damaged projects as of September 30, 2018. FEMA obligated funding for both emergency work and permanent work (i.e., long-term repair and restoration of infrastructure) projects. Emergency work projects focused on debris removal and emergency protective measures. Permanent work projects were focused on repairing or replacing damaged infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and power lines, and hazard mitigation measures to reduce the risk of future disasters. FEMA also obligated funding to repair and rebuild damaged buildings and equipment. FEMA expects to review an additional 900 future projects for eligibility representing an estimated $779.4 million in potential funding. Of this estimated total amount, FEMA anticipates $128.5 million (16 percent) in costs for future emergency work projects and $650.9 billion (84 percent) for future permanent work. In July 2018, FEMA approved a June 2018 request from the Governor of the US Virgin Islands to transition from using the standard public assistance program to the public assistance alternative procedures program. The alternative procedures provide new flexibilities to FEMA that are not available in the standard program. For example, the alternative procedures allow for awards for projects to be made on the basis of fixed-cost estimates to provide financial incentives for the timely and cost-effective completion of work. Under the Public assistance alternative procedure, if the actual cost of a project exceeds the fixed- cost estimate agreed upon by FEMA and a recipient, the recipient or subrecipient is responsible for the additional costs at the time of the close-out process. The Public Assistance Alternative Procedures Permanent Work Guide for the USVIA states that all cost estimates for projects using these procedures must be finalized by March 2020. In addition, the territory is able to use any excess funds for hazard mitigation or other activities that improve the recipient's or sub recipient's future Public Assistance operations or planning.
Federal agencies rely on identity proofing to help ensure that individuals who apply for federal benefits and services are who they claim to be. However, identity fraud can occur when an individual's identity is not verified through a physical inspection, such as a driver's license or passport, but instead through an online exchange of information. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' use of remote identity-proofing processes. This report (1) describes selected federal agency practices for remote identityproofing of individuals seeking access to major web-based applications using services provided by consumer reporting agencies and the risks associated with those practices, (2) assesses selected agencies' actions to ensure the effectiveness of these processes, and (3) evaluates the sufficiency of federal guidance for assuring the security of federal systems. To address these objectives, GAO selected six agencies—the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), the United States Postal Service (USPS), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the General Services Administration (GSA)—and interviewed officials at these agencies. The six agencies that GAO reviewed—CMS, IRS, SSA, USPS, VA, OMB, and GSA—use a variety of techniques, including knowledge-based verification, to ensure that the individuals who enroll for federal services and benefits are who their claims indicate they are. These techniques are commonly used by federal agencies to verify the identity of individuals applying for benefits or services online. Knowledge- based verification is a technique that commonly has been used for this purpose. For example, in 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued guidance that effectively prohibits the use of this technique for sensitive applications because of the risk of an attacker obtaining and using the individual's personal information to answer questions and successfully impersonate that individual to fraudulently obtain federal benefits. GA OMB and NIST also provide guidance to federal agencies on information security management, including remote identity Proofing. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) is intended to provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effective oversight of information security risks. FISMA requires agencies to implement NIST's technical guidance on many different information security subjects within one year of issuance. In the case of the updated NIST guidance, agencies would have needed to implement the guidance by June 2018 to meet OMB's time frames. While it has not yet been issued, a draft policy document developed by OMB in April 2018 indicates that OMB intends to provide policy-level guidance for agencies to identify, credential, monitor, and manage user access to information and information systems and adopt sound processes for authentication and access control. The draft policy does not, however, require agencies to report on progress in implementing secure remote identity proofed processes. As a result, agencies may be at risk of implementing weak methods of remote proofing for individuals who seek access to federal services or benefits, which may put both the federal government and individuals at risk for fraud. Several of the selected agencies have taken steps to better ensure the effective implementation of their remote identityProofing processes, but only two have eliminated the use or planned to eliminate knowledge-Based Verification. Specifically, GSA and IRS have eliminated their use of these techniques for their login.gov and Get Transcript services, respectively, and VA has implemented alternative methods for its Get Transcript service, but has no plans to eliminate its remaining use of knowledge- Based Verification for certain categories of individuals. SSA and USPS are investigating alternative methods and have stated that they intend to reduce or eliminate their use in the future, but do not yet have specific plans for doing so. In addition, CMS has no specific plans with time frames or milestones to eliminate the use and implementation of knowledge based verification for its Healthcare.gov service. Until these agencies develop specific plans, they will remain at an increased risk of identity fraud. NIST and OMB have not provided sufficient guidance to ensure agencies move to more secure forms of Remote Identity Proofing while also addressing issues of technical feasibility and usability for all members of the public. While NIST has issued guidance to agencies related to identity proofersing and O MB is drafting identity management guidance, these efforts are not sufficient to ensure agency adoption of secure methods for remote verification. As GAO previously reported, NISTs guidance effectively prohibits
The U.S. retirement system is supported by three main pillars—Social Security, employer-sponsored plans, and individuals' savings—that serve as important sources of retirement income for Americans. Currently, each of these pillars faces various risks and other challenges. If left unchanged, these risks present the federal government with significant potential fiscal exposures, which may legally commit or create expectations for future federal spending. GAO's prior work has identified a need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of the nation's approach to financing retirement. This testimony discusses (1) the current state of retirement in the United States, (2) selected federal legislation that has shaped retirement since 1960, (3) the structure, scope, and recommendations of past federal commissions on retirement issues, and (4) what GAO can learn from the experiences of other countries. This statement is based on a prior GAO report (GAO-18-111SP ) issued in November 2017 and prior work GAO has conducted for this committee. For this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and other documents; interviewed federal officials; and convened a panel of retirement experts in November 2016 to discuss retirement issues. The United States faces a number of challenges in financing its retirement system. The Social Security retirement program is facing financial difficulties, as are other federal programs that provide essential supports to many older Americans, such as Medicare and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). In addition, multiple federal agencies help fund a broad array of home and community-based services for older adults. As the number of older adults needing assistance continues to grow, the pressure to increase federal funding for these services is likely to increase. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA, P.L. 108-375) strengthened the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit (DB) plans, which traditionally promise to provide a monthly payment to retirees for life. However, in recent years, there has been a shift from DB plans to defined contribution (DC) plans. DC plans allow individuals to accumulate tax-advantaged retirement savings in an individual account based on employee and/or employer contributions, and the investment returns earned on the account. While some DC plans also offer monthly payments through an annuity, most do not provide lifetime income options or other options that can help participants draw down their retirement funds in a systematic way. The personal saving rate—which is calculated as the proportion of disposable income that households save—has trended steeply downward over the past several decades, from a high of 14.2 percent in 1975, to a low of 3.1 percent in 2005, before recovering somewhat to 6.8 percent in 2018. While the specific implications of a historically low national saving rate on any current or future retiree are less clear, the decline in the personal savings rate over time is concerning and could have implications for retirement security, particularly when coupled with the recent trend of low wage growth. The nation has taken an incremental approach to addressing retirement issues over the last 40 years; however, such an approach may not be able to effectively address the interrelated foundational nature of the challenges facing the system today. Without a more comprehensive reevaluation, identifying effective, enduring solutions may be difficult and the consequences could be significant. Unless timely action is taken, many Americans risk not having sufficient means for a secure and dignified retirement.
FHA's mortgage insurance program helps home buyers obtain financing by providing insurance on single-family mortgage loans. When a borrower defaults on a mortgage, FHA requires servicers to convey the property to FHA, which maintains the property in its name until it is sold or transferred to a third party. Servicers convey about 610,000 properties annually. GAO was asked to review FHA's conveyance process. This report examines (1) timelines for foreclosed property conveyances in June 2010-December 2017 and the extent to which servicers and FHA met time requirements and (2) changes FHA has made to the process in recent years and any ongoing process challenges. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FHA data for July 2010 through December 2017, the most recent year for which data were available; reviewed relevant FHA policies and procedures; and interviewed FHA officials and representatives of 20 large- and medium-sized, bank and nonbank servicers of FHA-insured mortgages. The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) property conveyance processes often takes a long time, and servicers' and contractors' performance against time requirements varied widely. From July 2010 to December 2017—the most recent data available—the process took a median of 70 days, but this figure varied widely by year. For example, from 2011 through 2015, the median number of days to complete the process increased four-fold (from 41 to 161 days) and varied more widely around the median each successive year. Conveyance time frames declined substantially in 2016 and 2017 while continuing to vary considerably around the Median (see fig.). In comparison, the process generally should take about 37 days for a property to be conveyed, including 30 days for FHA to inspect the property, 7 days to make necessary repairs and convey title to the servicer, and 30 days to assign a marketing contractor to promote and sell the property. However, servicers often did not convey properties within the required 30-day time frame. FHA and mortgage industry representatives GAO interviewed cited several reasons for these delays, including property damage caused by extended default and foreclosure periods and increased use of other disposition methods, such as third-party sales. In addition, representatives from six of the 20 servicers GAO spoke with said that the process for reviewing additional funds needed to complete work negatively affected their ability to convey a property in 30 days. F HA's compliance and maintenance contractors generally met the required time frames for key conveyance tasks for properties conveyed from 2011 to 2017. For instance, the compliance contractor had 5 business days to review a servicer's overallowable request for additional funds and either reject the request or approve all or some of the requested amount. When the contractors did not meet their required timeframes, the delays may have lengthened the time to complete conveyance for some properties. In recent years FHA updated aspects of the conveyance system to help address some of these challenges, but GAO found limitations in the clarity and comprehensiveness of some of its conveyance policies. Specifically, in 2016 FHA increased property preservation and protection allowances to better align allowances with those of other mortgage industry participants, but some servicers said the changes did not help or helped in some ways but presented more challenges in other ways. In March 2018, F HA incorporated a preconveyance inspection pilot into the asset disposition system, the information system servicers use to convey properties to FHAs. The pilot is intended to expedite the process by inspecting certain properties before conveyance, but FHA does not have a plan for evaluating the pilot's results. GA O's guide for designing evaluations states that key components of an evaluation design include the evaluation questions or objectives; information sources and measures; data collection methods; an analysis plan, including evaluative criteria or comparisons; and an assessment of study limitations. Certain characteristics of the pilot underscore the importance of incorporating these components into evaluation design. Without a well-designed evaluation that includes key elements of evaluation design--such as evaluation objectives and measures--and utilizes participant feedback and control groups--FHA risks making decisions about the pilot based on incorrect or incomplete information on its benefits and drawbacks.
DOD has the authority to award prototype other transactions, which are contracts between two or more defense contractors that are intended to provide a prototype of a product or technology to a third party, such as a research institution or a non-profit research institution, for research, development, test, and evaluation purposes. In 2001, Congress expanded DOD's prototype other transaction authority to allow for follow-on production other transactions. The conference report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's use of prototype other contracts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD used prototype other Transactions from fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and (2) the processes DOD used to evaluate the status and participation of non-traditional companies on these transactions. GAO reviewed DOD's fiscal year 2016-2018 contract data and other documents related to prototype and other transactions and interviewed officials from DOD, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Army, and other defense agencies. The Department of Defense's (DOD) use of prototypes other transactions—contracts between two defense contractors for the production of products or technologies other than traditional defense contracts—increased from 34 in fiscal year 2014 to 173 in 2018. DOD obligated a total of $7.2 billion on prototype other projects during this time frame. The total number of new prototype other agreements increased five-fold from 34 to 173. The Army, Defense Advanced research projects agency, and the Air Force accounted for 97 percent of all new awards and actions that resulted in a change in obligations from fiscal year 2015 through 2018. The majority of obligations were to consortiums and traditional defense contractors. DOD reported that at least one non- traditional company or non- nonprofit research institution participated to a significant extent—one of four statutory conditions that Congress established for the appropriate use of a prototype other contract—in 88 percent of the 1,250 new awards made from fiscal Years 2016 through 2017. The other two companies among the top five were traditional defense contractor—Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne. In response to congressional direction, DOD expects to submit a report in November 2019 on its use of the prototype other Transaction authority for fiscal year 2018, including, among other elements, data on the number and types of prototype and production other contracts awarded and actions taken. DOD's Defense Pricing and Contracting is collecting the required data directly from DOD components. DOD and military component officials whom GAO interviewed acknowledged limitations in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data. DOD officials stated they have addressed some of these limitations and officials are discussing how to improve the information collected in the future. DOD agreements officers used multiple methods to determine whether and to what extent non- Traditional companies were participating on the prototype and followed established review processes for nine of the 11 transactions GAO examined. For example, agreements officers determined whether a company was traditional or non traditional by reviewing government databases and consulting with subject matter experts, among others. Agreements officers also determined the extent that a company would be expected to participate on a prototype transaction by assessing whether the contractor was performing all the work, evaluating whether the services or technologies provided by the non-Traditional companies were critical, or considering the percentage of total costs or labor hours performed by the contractor. Each of the DOD contracting offices GAO assessed established policies for reviewing prototype other acquisitions before award, though the processes differed. Ag agreements officers followed their commands' established review process, which involved higher level reviews by senior officials and legal reviews, in nine of 11 transactions. For the two remaining transactions, senior contracting officials plan to take action to address the issues GAO identified. For these two transactions, GAO found that agreements officers did not meet policy requirements for obtaining higher level review before award.
This testimony discusses the federal government's response to and recovery from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Centers for Infectious Disease Preparedness, Response, and Response to the Pandemic Influenza Virus-19 (COVID-19) and our recommendations for executive action and matters for legislative action. In June 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 (CARES Act), which modified key program components and provided $2.6 trillion in emergency appropriations to respond to public health and economic threats posed by CO VID-19. This testimony is based on GAO's initial report issued yesterday (GAO- 2020-10-852R). It focuses on (1) key federal actions to respond and recover from COVID- 19 and GAO recommendations for Executive Action and Matters for Legislative Action and (2) evolving lessons learned from the initial response and past emergencies that highlight areas for continued attention and oversight. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and other documents; interviewed federal officials; and collected data from federal agencies, to the extent practicable, as of May 31, 2020. GAO is not making any new recommendations in this testimony. In response to the national public health, economic, and public safety threats caused by COvid-19, four relief laws were enacted as of June 2020. These laws have appropriated $2,6 trillion across the government. Six areas account for 86 percent of the appropriations--the Paycheck protection program, economic impact payments, unemployment insurance, the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, the Economic Stabilization and Assistance to Distressed Sectors, the Coronavirus Relief Fund, and unemployment insurance. The first of these laws, CARES Act (P.L. 2020), was enacted in March 2020 and provides $1.5 trillion in assistance to states, localities, and individuals. The second law, Pensions and Disability Insurance Relief Act of 2018 (PERS Act), enacted in June 2018, provides $3.5 billion in assistance for states and localities. The third law, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (ESPA) for Fiscal Year 2019 (PASPA), provides $4.2 billion in emergency assistance. The fourth law, Disaster Unemployment Compensation and Emergency Supplemental Assistance Act of 2019 (ESBA), was passed in June 2019. The nation has made some progress in fighting the virus, but the virus continues to pose risks to all Americans, and there is a concern of another wave of infection this fall. This could coincide with the seasonal influenza and hurricane season--further straining federal agencies responsible for responding to these events, as well as the health care system. Additionally, the nation's initial response to COVI-19 highlights the challenges presented by an inherent fragmentation across responsibilities and capabilities in the federal biodefense response and health care systems, which includes private, public (local, state, and federal governments), and nonprofit entities. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported incomplete and inconsistent data from state and jurisdictional health departments on the amount of viral testing occurring nationwide, making it more difficult to track and know the number of infections, mitigate their effects, and inform decisions on reopening communities. However, HHS issued guidance on June 4, 2020, to laboratories that identifies required data elements to collect and how to report them to CDC. In addition, the Small Business Administration (SBA) rapidly processed over $512 billion in 4.6 million guaranteed loans through private lenders to small businesses and other organizations adversely affected by COID-19 and expended about $2 billion on lender fees. SBA moved quickly to establish a new nationwide program but the pace contributed to confusion and questions about the program and raised program integrity concerns. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Treasury disbursed 160.4 million payments worth $269 billion to individuals and businesses in the first quarter of 2020. The agencies faced difficulties delivering payments to some individuals, and they face additional risks related to making improper payments to ineligible individuals, such as decedents, and fraud. The Department of Labor (DOL) has taken steps to help states manage demand for unemployment insurance (UI), but it is developing its approach to overseeing the new UI programs.
A complete and accurate address list is the cornerstone of a successful census because it identifies all living quarters that are to receive a census questionnaire and serves as the control mechanism for following up with households that do not respond. The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) maintains a master address list (MAF) once every 10 years, near the end of the decennial census cycle. The LUCA program is intended to ensure that tribal, state, and local governments have the opportunity to review the Bureau's address list and provide updates to the MAF. GAO was asked to review LUCA for the 2020 Census. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Bureau implemented LUCA 2020 in accordance with its operational plan, (2) how LUCA affected fieldwork in other 2020 Census operations, and (3) opportunities for the Bureau to reexamine LUCA's role for the 2030 Census. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials, subject matter specialists, and state-level LUCA participants and stakeholders. The Bureau's implementation of the Local Area Update of the Census Act (LUCA) 2020 largely followed its LUCA operational plan. For example, the Bureau met nearly all milestones, conducted outreach and training, and obtained participation according to its plan. However, it missed several opportunities to maximize the benefits of LUCA toward improving the quality and reducing the cost of the census. For instance, while the Bureau is planning to use administrative records to reduce the amount of follow-up it does seeking responses from vacant or nonexistent addresses in 2020, it did not plan to use LUCA data on hard-to-count areas, such as areas with high-growth areas, to improve its modeling of administrative records, which could have helped the Bureau better target its outreach efforts. In addition, LUCA has not fundamentally changed or been reexamined since its authorizing legislation was enacted in 1994, and GAO has previously reported on the importance of targeting a program's benefits to those with the greatest needs and the least capacity to meet those needs. In 2005, in response to a need to inform Congress of GAO's insights in order to help its budget and programmatic deliberations and oversight activities, we identified criteria for reexaminating federal programs to address fiscal instability while updating federal programs and priorities to meet current and future challenges. These criteria include whether the program is using the most cost-effective approach when compared to other tools and program designs; whether a program is targeted to those who have the greatest need; and what would be the likely consequences of eliminating an operation. While the Bureau largely implemented its approach for LUCA2020 as planned, it identified challenges for future implementation to address. Specifically, increased fieldwork, time for participants to review their address lists, and use of data onhard- to-count populations all emerged as challenges for the bureau to address in any future implementation of a LUCA or a similar program. In response to the higher-than-anticipated number of address updates received from LUCA in 2020—about 5.1 million—the Bureau decided to review a sample of updates in areas not slated automatically for in-field review, passing even more work directly on to Non-Response Follow-Up (NRFU) at a potential cost of more than $25 million (in constant 2020 dollars). NRFU is a Bureau effort to follow up with non-responding households after the census to determine the occupancy status of individual nonresponsive housing units and enumerate them. While NRFU costs are expected to be lower than in the 2010 Census, the high rate of erroneous addresses added to the address list through the LUCA appeals process will be an additional source of NRFU workload, making that operation more costly than necessary. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that agencies should use quality information to achieve their objectives, in part by obtaining relevant data from reliable sources, and the Bureau did not, however, use information about addresses gathered during LUCA to help with its modeling with administrative records for 2020, nor determine how best, and when, to transfer data between the respective Bureau teams to make this happen.
VHA's Family Caregiver Program is intended to provide services and support to eligible veterans and their caregivers who are caregivers of veterans who have a serious injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty on or before May 7, 1975 or on or after September 11, 2001. In June 2018, the VA MISSION Act included provisions directing VA to implement an IT system to support the program and the incremental expansion of program eligibility. GAO was asked to review VHA's implementation of the program. This report examines (1) staffing requirements for the program, (2) how VHA monitors VAMCs' performance processing applications, (3) the extent to which VAMC staff have completed required contacts and visits with caregivers and veterans, and (4) the status of VA's efforts to implement a VA Office of Inspector General (VA OIG) recommendation to improve the program's governance structure and staffing levels. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed VHA policies, procedures, and staffing data and interviewed VHA officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) CareGiver Support Program Office has not collected complete and accurate staffing data on all staff supporting the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN), which oversees the Family caregiver program, and the data that are collected are not validated. For example, the program office does not know the exact number of staff that are assigned to the program or the amount of time they spend on the program as a collateral duty. As a result, VHA does not have a complete understanding of the staffing resources needed to meet program requirements. The Office of the Inspector General and GAO have reported that determining and ensuring there are sufficient program staff is one of VHAs greatest obstacles in meeting program requirements, which could be further exacerbated by the expansion of eligibility to include veterans who served prior to September 11. VHA is also impeded in its ability to assess whether VA medical centers (VAMC) staffing levels are adequate because it lacks system-wide data on the completion of required quarterly contacts and annual home visits with veterans and caregivers. The VA OIG reported in May 2019 that the program had implemented two recommendations related to establishing a governance environment and designating VISN lead officials. However, the remaining recommendations have not yet been implemented. VA has not yet implemented an information technology (IT) system that fully supports the needs of the Family Careediver Program. In 2015, the department spent about $2.86 million on CAT Rescue, a short-term project intended to improve both the quality of the systemincluding data quality and its reliability and securitybut the project did not deliver viable software improvements and was terminated in April 2018. A companion project, CareT, was initiated in September 2015 and was intended to produce a replacement system with expanded capabilities, such as easier caregiver application submission and enhanced caregiver program analysis capabilities. The CareT acquisition was suspended in January 2019 to assess the way forward and ultimately ended in late February 2019. VA commissioned two independent assessments that examined issues impacting the CAT Rescue and CareT projects. These assessments, completed by Digital Service at VA and the MITRE Corporation in early 2019, cited a number of deficiencies that likely contributed to the termination of CAT rescue and impacted the ability of CareT to successfully deliver new system capabilities. These deficiencies included a lack of sustained leadership or a product owner needed to create and enforce a technical vision across contractors and the department. With the loss of confidence in CareT as a viable solution and the subsequent results of the independent assessments, VA has redirected its efforts for a third time and initiated a new project, referred to as the Caregivers Record Management Application (CARMA), in March 2019. CARMA is focused on acquiring a solution to CAT using a commercial product that is to be configured to fit the programS needs. The first CARMA release is planned for late October 2019 and additional product releases are expected at least through the summer of 2020 to incorporate new capabilities such as online application submissions for veterans and the ability to connect to existing VA systems that manage veteran and caregiver identity and relationship management. As of June 2019, VA had taken steps to identify key project stakeholders, estimate costs, establish a timeline, and compile the initial set of requirements for implementing the first release. The department had also identified a Product Manager, who was to be responsible for coordinating efforts between OIT and VHA.
IAEA plays a central role in coordinating international nuclear security efforts. IAEA's mission is to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to verify through safeguards that nuclear technologies and materials are used for peaceful purposes and not diverted to nuclear weapons. The United States is a de-facto permanent member state and the lead U.S. agency for interacting with IAE a. GAO was asked to review the agency's nuclear security program. This report examines (1) the structure and range of nuclear security work that IEA conducts; (2) how IAEa plans and prioritizes its nuclear security activities and how it measures and reports on its performance; and (3) the challenges that the agency faces in carrying out its role in nuclear security. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from the Departments of State, Energy, Defense, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the National Security Council, and nuclear security experts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducts a broad range of activities to ensure the security of nuclear materials, facilities, and materials outside of regulatory control, and provides assistance to member states in areas such as establishing legal, regulatory, and technical infrastructure to secure nuclear materials and facilities and helping states detect and respond to radioactive material that should be under regulatory control but is not. The agency also assists member states with the repatriation of fissile and radioactive material from countries that no longer require or cannot adequately secure those materials to more secure storage in other countries. The Division of Nuclear Security (DNS) within the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security, within the Secretariat, is responsible for the nuclear security programs of the agency, which consists of four subprograms: Nuclear Security of Materials and Facilities, Information Management, Program Development and International Cooperation, and Education and Training. The Nuclear Security Program is implemented by DNS, which is structured into four sections that correspond to the four sub programs. Under these sub programs, the agency carries out a wide range ofnuclear security activities, including developing and promoting the use of guidance documents, providing assistance to states, and developing training programs. In addition, DNS coordinates international efforts to improve nuclear security through the Nuclear Security Summits, which brought heads of state together to discuss and bring high-level international attention to nuclear security issues. In 2016, summit participants issued an Action Plan to document their commitments to the agency to support its nuclearsecurity mission, including recognizing the leading role the agency plays in coordinating multilateral nuclear security and providing guidance. I AEA plans itsnuclear security work through a range of documents, including a biennial Programme and Budget (P&B), but does not prioritize activities or fully measure or report on program performance. For example, the P&B identifies four high- level performance measures, such as the number of member states requesting and receiving assistance through INSSPs, and between four and six performance measures for each nuclear security subprogram. However, these measures do not fully align with leading practices for performance management. For instance, one of the program's objectives is contributing to global nuclear security by establishing guidance and providing for its use through advisory services and capacity building; there is a performance measure related to advisory services, but no measure for guidance. The nuclear security Program also relies heavily on extra-budgetary contributions, which adversely affects program management and human resources in ways that may undermine effective program management. The Department of State (State) has been the lead agency in the United States in interacting with the agency and is the lead federal agency for coordinating policy and financial contributions to IAE A. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NSCG) is a government-level forum for proposing and developing ideas rather than as a formal decision-making body. NSCG convenes two to three times per year and follows up on commitments made at the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, but many experts GAO interviewed said the process lacks transparency, which makes it difficult to discern the group's accomplishments. The group's membership is open to all member states, but it does not publish its proceedings, which some experts said would require getting consensus among members, which would shift the focus of the group from discussion to decisionmaking. In 2018, NSCg included language to encourage the agency in its Nuclear Security Resolution to improve communication with the public and member states about its activities and their global impact. According to U. S. and member-state officials and experts, IAEO member states disagree over the
MDA is responsible for developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to defend the United States and its allies against a variety of ballistic missile threats, including those from North Korea, Iran, and other rogue states. In fiscal year 2018, MDA began fielding new capabilities to counter these threats. GAO was asked to review MDA's progress in delivering capabilities. This report examines (1) the extent to which MDA delivered capabilities and assets and conducted tests in 2018, and (2) the impact of mid-year budget changes on future-year plans. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed MDA documents and interviewed MDA officials. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) made progress in 2018 in its mission to defend U.S. and allies from enemy ballistic missiles, but did not meet all of its goals for the fiscal year. Specifically, the agency delivered capabilities to the Korean Peninsula in February and September 2018. However, it did not deliver all planned assets for its European Phased Adaptive Approach to counter intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) threats from Iran, known as EPAA Phase 3, which is intended to provide a more robust IRBM defense in Europe. The agency delivered planned upgrades and additional assets, but the delivery of the third and final phase of the EPAA has been delayed by 18 months. Despite this delay, testing has been significantly reduced and de-scoped or deferred past the new delivery date, which reduces the warfighter's insight on the system's capabilities and limitations. MDA plans to deliver additional capabilities in Korea in the future. In addition, in December 2017, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Department of Defense Missile Defeat and Defense Enhancements Appropriations Act, 2018 (MDDE), which increased missile defense appropriations. The act provided approximately $2 billion in appropriations for missile defense. MDDE provided funds in support of plans that would expand and accelerate several missile defense programs beyond the agency's previous baselines. These plans most significantly affected the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program and the Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA program. Under the plans and with the funds provided by MDDE, the GMD program will increase its inventory from 44 interceptors to 64 interceptors by 2023. Each of these new interceptors will be equipped with the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), accelerating the latter program's schedule by approximately one year. The RKV program, in part to support the accelerated schedule, adopted a new program schedule that required concurrency in some areas. The program began procuring some components before completing qualification testing to accommodate the newly accelerated schedule. Upon completion of the first intercept test, the program planned to award a production contract for Lot 1 and the long-lead materials for Lot 2 following a major design review, but before the first flight test. Through the course of fiscal year 2021, the RKKV is expected to award the final lot, Lot 3, through the first quarter of the next fiscal year, and then award a second and third lot through the second quarter of fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively. The Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IIa program was still in development at the time of GAO's review, and these funds represented the first time Congress appropriated procurement funds, and not research and development, for the program.
Federal agencies depend on computerized information systems and electronic data to process, maintain, and report essential information, and to operate and control physical processes. The security of these systems and data is vital to public confidence and the nation's safety, prosperity, and well-being. However, computer networks and systems used by federal agencies can be riddled with security vulnerabilities—both known and unknown. These systems are often interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks, including the internet, thereby increasing the number of avenues of attack. DHS plays a key role in the cybersecurity posture of the federal government. Federal law and policy outline DHS's responsibilities for administering the implementation of agency information security policies and practices for non-national security information systems, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). One of DHS's operational directives is to issue binding operational directives to federal civilian agencies that align with OMB's policies, principles, standards, and guidelines. GAO was asked to review DHS's implementation of these directives. This report examines (1) DHS's process for developing and overseeing implementation of the directives and (2) the effectiveness of the directive implementation, including agencies' implementation. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DHS documents and interviewed officials from DHS, OMB, and selected civilian agencies. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has designed, but not fully implemented, a draft process to develop and oversee the cybersecurity binding operational directive (BOD) 18-01, Enhance Email and Web Security, issued in October 2017. The draft process requires DHS to identify topics for new directives from a wide variety of sources, including technical assessments, operational findings of cybersecurity issues, and discussions with external partners such as the Federal Chief Information Officer Council, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or the General Services Administration (GSA). DHS is to consider, among other things, whether or not a potential directive topic could be best addressed using the directive process, as well as considering its potential value and impact. Once a topic is identified, DHS's Federal Network Resilience (FNR) is to conduct research on the topic and solicit feedback from stakeholders, such as federal agency chief information officers and chief information security officers, and relevant officials. Once the research is completed, FNR is to make a determination on whether to proceed in developing a directive. DHS has not followed key components of the draft process, including involving stakeholders early in directive development. For example, DHS did not coordinate with NIST and GSA early in the directive development process to ensure that a new directive did not conflict with their guidance. As a result, the draft directive may not include all key technical considerations, leaving agency systems at risk of being exposed to threats or vulnerabilities. In addition, DHS does not have a strategy to independently validate agencies' self-reported actions on BOD requirements, as called for in the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2014 (FISMA). Without such an approach, the likelihood that requirements will not be completely or correctly addressed is increased. This could leave federal agencies riddled with information security vulnerabilities. Federal civilian agencies have made significant progress in addressing the individual email and web security requirements of the five directives that apply to them. Specifically, according to GAO's analysis of agency data, the agencies were between about 83 to 99 percent complete in addressing each individual requirement across all of their domains (a unique identifying address assigned to an internet-accessible system such as .gov or dhs.gov, and an individual agency may have multiple domains). However, only 3 of 83 agencies (4 percent) had fully addressed all of the requirements due within the 120 day deadline for all domains within 90 days (by January 2018), within 120 days ( by February 2018), and within 1 year (by October 2018). Further, only 6 agencies (7 percent) have fully addressed the requirements in 1 year of issuance (October 2018). Agencies and DHS cited a number of reasons for not fulfilling the requirements, including a lack of resources and technical expertise and vendor constraints, among others, and operational issues.
Underride crashes occur when a passenger vehicle crashes into the rear of a tractor-trailer or other large truck and slides under the body of the truck, resulting in injury or death. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requires rear guards on most large trucks, but there are no federal requirements for side or front guards. GAO was asked to review issues related to underride crashes. This report examines (1) the data DOT reports on underride crash fatalities and (2) the development and use of underride guard technologies in the U.S. DOT and NHTSA's efforts to develop and use underride guards. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from 2008 through 2017, the 10 most recent years for which these data are available, reviewed relevant literature, and interviewed officials from DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and other federal, state, local, and foreign transportation agencies, as well as representatives from five selected states and two local police departments. Underride crashes—involving passenger compartment intrusion—are more likely to result in a fatality or serious injury than crashes in which the passenger vehicle's safety features engage and are able to protect the occupants. From 2008 to 2017, reported underride fatalities on average accounted for less than 1 percent of total traffic fatalities and 5.5 percent of all fatalities related to large truck crashes during this time frame, according to data from the National Highway Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), a database of all fatal traffic crashes in the United States. However, the Department of Transportation's (DOT) data show an annual average of about 219 fatalities resulting from underride-related crashes involving one or more trucks over the same period, which is less than the 34,700 total fatalities and approximately 4,000 fatalities involving large trucks reported in the FARS over this same period. DOT's FMCSA—the federal agency that oversees commercial vehicle safety—requires rear guards for certain trucks, such as trucks that are more than 30 inches above the ground, but does not require rear guards to be installed on all single-unit trucks—such as dump trucks and large pick-up trucks—because these trucks vary widely with respect to weight, dimensions, and purpose. In addition, DOT's regulations do not specifically include an inspection of the rear guard, which may be damaged during normal use, for example by backing into loading docks. DOT data show that rear guard violations may be identified during roadside inspections, but they constitute a small percentage of all violations. For example, out of about 5.8 million violations identified during inspections in 2017, approximately 2,400, or 0.042 percent, were rear guards violations. DOT has not performed research on the overall effectiveness and cost of these guards, and manufacturers GAO interviewed said that they are hesitant to invest in developing side guards without such research. DOT estimates that about 95 percent of newly manufactured trailers already meet the stronger rear guard requirements for trailers, but rear guards may not be regularly inspected to ensure they are safe. Side guards are being developed, but stakeholders identified challenges to their use such as the stress on trailer frames due to the additional weight and limited clearance from the ground that could limit the geographic locations that could be serviced by a trailer or—if the guards drag along the ground—result in damage to the guards or even the trailer. While these guards have the potential to mitigate crashes, it is unlikely that they will be available on a more widespread scale in a time frame soon enough to render them unnecessary. While some research organizations have developed computer models of front guards for cab-over (lowering the profile of the cab of a cab to be more compatible with that of a truck) to reduce the potential for underride or override, no designs for these guards are available for purchase or installation.
The U.S. commercial space transportation industry provides a service that has become essential to many aspects of government, business, and society. The capability to launch payloads into space enables national security missions, mobile communications, and scientific research, among many other applications. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for ensuring the safe and efficient use of the National Airspace System (NAS), a limited national resource, for all users, including commercial and business airlines and commercial launch providers, among others. GAO was asked to review FAA's oversight of commercial space launches. This report (1) describes how the construction of infrastructure at selected U. S. commercial launch sites has been funded; (2) describes key factors that influence where orbital launches occur; (3) summarizes actions FAA has taken to streamline its commercial space launch regulations; (4) examines how well-positioned FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) is to determine its current and future workforce needs; and (5) identifies actions FAA is taking to better integrate commercial space operations into the NAS. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and directives; analyzed FAA documents; and interviewed FAA, AST, and industry officials. Funding for infrastructure at active commercial space sites has shifted from federal to state, local, and private sources since the mid-20th century. In recent years, nearly all FAA-licensed commercial orbital launches in the United States occurred at three federal ranges, which were originally built by the federal government. All 61 of the commercial orbital orbital launches from 2015 through 2018 occurred at launch sites that are on or co-located with federal ranges. In addition, one of the 11 licensed commercial suborbital launches occurred at a launch site co- located with a federal range. While the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) made the initial infrastructure investment at these sites, the launch complexes used for commercial launch operations are now operated under use agreements by non-federal entities, such as state governments or private launch providers. The federal government generally still has responsibility for maintaining common-use infrastructure—that is, infrastructure that may be shared by multiple users. As part of the operators' use agreements (the details of which vary depending on the launch site and launch site operator), however, funding for improvements to infrastructure used solely by that site operator is generally left to the site operator. This arrangement is in part because the infrastructure improvements are necessary to support the unique needs of specific commercial launch vehicles using those sites. According to the seven domestic and non-U.S.-based companies GAO interviewed that use launch services for placing their products into Earth orbit or other trajectories, several factors influence their selection of a launch provider, including the launch provider's capabilities and price. For example, six of the seven launch customers GAO spoke with said the price is a key deciding factor. FAA has been considering changes in its licensing regulations since 2015 and recently has accelerated these efforts. In May 2018, a Presidential Directive was issued that addressed both the timing and content of FAA's regulatory updates. The directive contained a deadline to publish a proposed regulation for public comment by February 1, 2019. DOT published a proposed rule in April 2019, but related rulemaking activities affect when regulatory changes will be in full effect. FAA is statutorily required to provide a period of time to solicit public comments on the proposed regulation. FAA must then reasonably respond to comments and determine whether any changes to the proposed rule may be required as a result of the comments. Some changes made in response to comments would allow AST to proceed with publication of the final regulation. However, major changes not contemplated in the NPRM could necessitate a supplemental NPRM, which could affect the timing of the regulation's publication. FAA provided 60 days after publication in the Federal Register for the public comment period. While officials told GAO that they plan to work toward publishing the final rule by the end of 2019, the schedule was affected by the Department of Transportation's lapse in appropriations. AST has taken steps to better understand its workforce needs, but does not have a complete understanding of its current or projected workload, nor does it know the number of staff and types of staff skills and competencies necessary to meet those workload needs. AST's workforce plan states that it needs additional staff in nearly all areas of its office, but it has not developed workload metrics that would allow it to determine the appropriate number and composition of
In 2005, FinCEN and the federal banking regulators issued guidance to clarify BSA/AML requirements and supervisory expectations for banks that provide services to money transmitters and other money services businesses (MSB) in the United States. GAO was asked to review banks' efforts to comply with these requirements. This report examines (1) regulators' and examiners' views on bank challenges in complying with BSA and anti-money laundering requirements for MSBs and (2) the extent to which banks are terminating or limiting money transmitter accounts and their reasons for doing so. To address these objectives, GAO surveyed a nationally representative sample of 406 banks and interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of representatives from 11 of the nation's largest banks and 12 of the largest credit unions, selected based on asset size, among other factors. To evaluate regulators' assessment and response to derisking concerns, we reviewed agency guidance and documentation and interviewed agency management. In addition, we conducted eight discussion groups with examiners from the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and five other federal regulators to understand how they applied the FFIEC manual in assessing banks' compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA)/anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements for banks with MSB customers. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and the Office of Management and Budget's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have taken some steps to address concerns that banks may be derisked, but have not fully addressed GAO's prior recommendation to evaluate the full range of factors that may be influencing banks to Derisk (i.e., limiting certain services or ending their relationships with customers to avoid perceived regulatory concerns about facilitating money laundering). GAO reported in March 2018 that regulators had taken only limited steps to understand the influence of banks' regulatory concerns and BSA compliance concerns on theirDerisking efforts. In particular, regulators had focused primarily on the filing of Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), which are required to be filed by banks when transactions involve or aggregate at least $5,000 in funds or other assets for banks or $2,000 for money transmitors and when the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the transaction is suspicious. However, these actions had not been aimed at addressing—and, if possible, ameliorating—the full rangeof factors that influence banks to engage in Derisking, particularly how banks' BSA-related concerns and AML compliance concerns may be affecting banks' deriskings. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. Federal banking regulators have issued interagency guidance to banks to clarify expectations for providing banking services to MSBs (including money transmiters) and have relied on this guidance when reviewing banks' MSB customer accounts. For example, in March 2005, the regulators issued a joint statement noting that MSBs were losing access to banking services as a result of concerns about regulatory scrutiny, the risks presented by MSB accounts, and the costs and burdens associated with maintaining such accounts. According to the joint statement, these concerns might have stemmed, in part, from banks' misperception of the requirements of the BSA. More recently, in November 2014, in a statement reiterating that banks can serve the MSB industry while meeting their BSA obligations and referring to the interagency Guidance to Banks on providing services toMSBs, the Federal Financial Stability Oversight Council (FFIEC) noted concerns that some banks were indiscriminately terminating the accounts of all MSBs, or refusing to open accounts for any MSB, thereby eliminating them as a category of customers. In a March 2018 report, we also reported that in response to banks' account terminations and limitations, some banks have become more conservative in the types of businesses to which they offer accounts. In some cases, banks offer MSBs bank accounts but on a limited basis. In these cases, some of these banks have terminated accounts with their institution while maintaining accounts with other money transmitrs, which can result in a money transmitter ceasing operations, loss of revenue, higher costs for services provided, and failure of the business.
IRS provides tax advantages to help individuals save for retirement, including small business owners, independent contractors, and other workers not covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans. Some IRA owners invest in unconventional assets—such as real estate, certain precious metals, virtual currency, and private equity—that are hard-to-value and may be difficult to value at fair market value (FMV). These unconventional assets can increase the risk of noncompliance with IRA rules. GAO was asked to review issues related to IRAs with unconventional assets. This report examines (1) the extent to which IRS has collected data on IRA owners' unconventional assets and (2) the challenges IRS faces in enforcing rules for IRAs that invest in such assets. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials about IRA noncompliance. The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) data collection has improved, but opportunities exist to further strengthen the identification of potentially abusive IRAs. For example, for tax year 2016 filed in 2017, IRS was positioned for the first time to quantify the number of IRA accounts with specified types of hard to value assets. In February 2018, using the newly available data, an IRS cross-divisional team identified that about 2 million IRAs included one or more of these types of assets. However, only 1.6 million custodians reported an FMV dollar amount for these assets. Forthcoming tax regulations on IRAs may help to improve custodian reporting of FMVs on Form 5498. IRS has also begun requiring custodians to report IRA custodians' reporting of IRA asset values. IRS's primary Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer, states that taxpayers are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. This publication could better help taxpayers understand complex rules governing IRAs and help them comply with tax laws. IRS also produces a variety of information on its website, such as online tools, instructions and FAQs, on topics likely to affect owners of unconventional IRA assets. For more technical or specialized information, IRS could direct readers to the relevant sections of the Internal Revenue Code and related tax regulations. This additional information could help IRA owners better understand and navigate the potential compliance challenges associated with certain types of unconventional assets, which can result in increased tax liability for taxpayers making unintentional errors and jeopardize their retirement savings. Insufficient data and Fragmented Expertise across IRS organizational units complicate IRS enforcement of IRA rules involving unconventional assets. The Deputy Commissioner for Service and Enforcement commissioned a cross- divisional team comprised of representatives from all four IRS operating divisions to identify, assess, and mitigate risks of IRA non compliance. In its February 2018 interim presentation, the team categorized potential noncompliance risks over an IRA life cycle into two mitigation strategies, which are summarized below. 1. Noncompliance risks for most contribution and distribution IRA rules can be mitigated systemically through automated enforcement, for example, by matching information from taxpayer returns with information reported by custodians. For the large population of IRA owners investing in conventional assets held by custodian custodians, IRS relies on automated enforcement. 2. Non compliance risks associated with the small population of IRAs in which unconventional assets or under direct control of the IRA owner are generally mitigated through case-by-case audits. For instance, non compliance with the complex rules for prohibited transactions and unrelated business income is generally not reflected on individual tax returns.3. The 3-year statute of limitations for assessing taxes owed remains an obstacle in pursuing noncompliance that may span the many years of an IRA investment. IRS agreed with GAO's October 2014 recommendation for the Commissioner to work in consultation with the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) on a legislative proposal to expand the limitation period for IRA non Compliance. Treasury reviews and presents the administration's tax proposals and has not released a proposal as of October 2019.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program helps to offset the federal and state costs of most outpatient prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. Under the program, drug manufacturers pay rebates to states as a condition for the federal contribution to Medicaid spending for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs. In addition, the 340B Program allows covered entities, such as hospitals and health centers, to purchase drugs at discounted prices for Medicaid beneficiaries at no cost to the state. GAO was asked to review state Medicaid programs' policies on the use and identification of 340B drugs. This report examines (1) the extent to which states' policies and procedures for identifying and excluding these drugs from Medicaid rebate requests and (2) how the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) oversight of these policies affects the risk of duplicate discounts and forgone rebates. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed state Medicaid program policies, interviewed HHS officials, reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance, and interviewed drug manufacturers and other stakeholders. State Medicaid programs policies for using and identifying drugs purchased through the Medicaid drug rebate programknown as the “340B Programvary, are not always documented, and may not prevent duplicate discounts, as GAO found that nine states did not have written policies or procedures for all dispensing methods. For example, while Pennsylvania and Ohio had written policies regarding the use of these drugs in Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care, they had no policies requiring covered entities to carve out these drugs for Medicaid managed care beneficiaries at contract pharmacies. Without written policies, covered entities in those states may not be aware of requirements for dispensing and identifying these drugs, which could result in errors that lead to duplicate discounts. Additionally, some states may be forgoing rebates when covered entities are unable to purchase these drugs at the discounted prices because they are not listed on the Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF), a list of covered entities that HHSs Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established to assist in the identification of drugs provided to Medicaid FFS beneficiaries. The MEF is not intended to be used to identify and exclude drugs from rebate requests for managed carewhich is where the majority of Medicaid beneficiaries receive drugsbut some states have used the MEF to do so. In this instance, the state would not know to exclude drugs provided by those entities from the managed care plans utilization data that are used for requesting rebates, and would likely forgo Medicaid rebates as it would not be able to obtain those drugs from those plans. CMS oversight of states efforts to prevent these duplicate discounts is limited. CMS does not assess whether states have 340B policies and practices and, if so, whether they are documented, effective, and accessible to stakeholders. As a result, it is unable to proactively identify and correct problematic policies and processes, and prevent duplicative discounts. Further, HRSA audits do not assess covered entities compliance with the prohibition on duplicate discounts in managed care because the agency has not issued guidance on how covered entities should prevent such discounts. Without such guidance, the potential for duplicate discounts has existed since 2010, when manufacturers were required to begin paying rebates under managed care in addition to FFS.
Congress authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish the Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (CORD) Project in 2011 to develop and implement strategies to reduce childhood obesity among low-income children. The first phase of the CORD Project began in September 2011 and was completed in September 2016. The purpose of CORD phase 1 was to determine whether implementing strategies in public health sectors, including early care and education centers, schools and community organizations, and primary care sectors, such as health care clinics, could improve low- income children's risk factors for obesity. CDC funded three implementing grantees: San Diego State University, the Massachusetts State Department of Public Health, and the University of Texas Health Science. CORD's second phase, which started in June 2016, was to further test if strategies implemented in the primary care sector would reduce the body mass index (BMI) in children with obesity, or who were overweight with risks including medical and behavioral risks and family history. GAO was asked to review CORD. This report examines (1) CDC's design changes to the project between the three CORD phases and (2) the extent to which the evaluation center's cross-site evaluation and grantees' evaluation findings reported improvements in BMI and other outcomes among children receiving the strategies in the first phase and factors that affected implementation of the strategies. To do this work, GAO reviewed CDC documents and interviewed CDC officials, grantees, and others involved in the project. CDC made four key changes to its CORD project design in response to lessons learned and national recommendations. First, CDC shifted the scope of the project from prevention to treatment of children who are overweight or have obesity. Specifically, CDC modified the scope to only focus on implementing pediatric weight management interventions, one type of primary care treatment strategy. Second, CDC did not award grants to independent entities to conduct cross- site evaluations of the implementing grantee's demonstration projects. Third, CDC required grantees to conduct their own evaluations and report on outcomes associated with the strategies implemented under their demonstration projects, rather than relying on CDC to do so. Fourth, CDC changed the study design to focus on translating strategies proven to reduce obesity into routine use for low income families. CDC officials told GAO they modified the design of the study to address challenges in moving research-based, national recommendations, like the recommendations made by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, into practice. CDC also modified its expectations of grantees regarding the involvement of state Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) program officials in the demonstration projects to ensure that state Medicaid or CHIP program officials participated in the projects. CDC's evaluation center and implementing grants reported some improvements in outcomes measured among children who received CORD strategies. For example, CDC reported that positive changes on these outcomes were observed most often among the following groups of children, providing some evidence of the effectiveness of strategies delivered: Children who received primary care strategies (such as individualized counseling) in addition to public health strategies (e.g., school-based nutrition and physical activity curricula) in the two communities where the strategies were implemented in Massachusetts and Texas. However, the percentage of seventh grade students with obesity decreased from the start of implementation compared with 24 months after implementation in both communities, but these results were modest; the decrease was less than 3 percent. Grantees reported some modest or no effects on some outcome measures when compared to children who did not receive the strategies or who only received one strategy. CDC noted that small sample sizes were likely in part due to recruitment issues and limited statistical power, which affects the ability for more specific modeling or analysis to determine for whom the strategies works best. CDC and CORD grantees identified several factors affecting the implementation of strategies that reduced childhood obesity, including staff turnover, family support, and preexisting programs and policies. CDC has taken steps to share CORD design materials and available results with researchers and others, including sharing lessons learned through webinars, conferences, and meetings organized by other HHS agencies. In addition, CDC and other HHS officials have had preliminary discussions about how CMS could help grantees understand how Medicaid and CHIP programs could reimburse for the obesity-related strategies they are implementing.
In February 2017, the President traveled to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, for two days to attend the funeral of his son, Donald J. Trump. The Secret Service and the Department of Defense (DOD) are responsible for providing security for the President when he is in the United States. The White House Communications Agency and the White House Military Office also send personnel to accompany the President on his trips to the property. GAO was asked to review the Secret Service's and DOD's processes for handling the President's travel expenses. This report examines (1) the processes that the Secret service and DOD have in place to ensure that the President receives appropriate reimbursements for travel-related expenses and (2) the extent to which the U.S. Treasury Department receives payments designated as gifts from The Trump Organization. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Homeland Security provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The Executive Office of the President and the Trump Organization provided no comments. The Office of Management and Budget, Secret Service, and DOD are subject to regulations governing reimbursements to employees for official travel and operational space in support of the president's travel and travel expenses when personnel from these agencies travel. The Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) and Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) allow agencies to pay for employees' daily expenses when they are traveling within the continental United States, based on allowances set by the General Services Administration for the applicable location and date (per diem rates) or the actual expense of travel. Under the Federal Travel regulation, the maximum amount that a civilian employee may be reimbursed is 300 percent of the applicable per diem rate. The Joint Travel regulations allow uniformed service members to be reimbursed up to 300 percent for lodging when traveling in the continentalUnited States, but they can be reimburses more than 300 percent when traveling outside the continental USA. Officials from the Secret Services stated that they apply the same cost oversight processes for all presidential travel. Expenses for lodging are centrally billed to the agency, and employee meals and incidental expenses are reimbursed to the traveler. DOD has a standard process to oversee costs for lodging, meals, incidental expenses, and operating space during presidential travel to the resort. DOD personnel use the same processes to oversee these costs as they do for other Presidential trips to oversee travel to and from the resort to oversee lodging and meals. Treasury has regular processes for receiving payments designated by the President as gifts to the United United States and gifts to reduce the public debt. Under federal law, Treasury may receive general gifts and may also receive Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt. Treasury received one payment designated as a gift of $151,470 on February 22, 2018. In May 2017, The Trump Organisation issued a policy addressing profits generated from foreign government patronage at its businesses that states that it will make a single lump-sum payment annually after the end of its fiscal year.
The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 authorized TRICARE to provide health care coverage through three plan options for its non-Medicare-eligible beneficiary population—TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra. These options varied by enrollment requirements, choices in civilian and military treatment facility providers, and the amount beneficiaries must contribute toward the cost of their care. The NDAA also mandated that GAO conduct a study of the transition to TRICare Select, a new plan option for beneficiaries who had used the Standard and Extra plans as of December 31, 2017. This report examines (1) the extent to which beneficiaries' ratings of TRIC Care Select changed in the first year of the new plan, (2) the percentage of civilian providers who reported accepting TRicARE patients if they were also accepting other new patients, (3) the percent of beneficiaries who reported being able to obtain an appointment as soon as they needed, and (4) the reasons providers gave for not accepting new patients. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the 2017/2018 and 2019 surveys, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed DOD officials. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. DOD provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Non-Prime beneficiaries ratings of health care and the TRICADARE health plan were generally unchanged in the year following the transition from TRICACE Standard (2017/2018) and Extra (2018). Specifically, there was no statistically significant change in the number of non-prime beneficiaries who positively rated their health care or their health plans. However, in the 2019 survey, the percentage who reported having problems finding a civilian health care provider who would accept TRricARE increased from 27 to 32 percent. There was a statistically significant increase from 18 to 24 percent in the percent who reported problems finding specialty care providers in the 2018 survey. The percentage of beneficiaries reporting problems accessing primary care or mental health care care remained statistically unchanged from the prior year26 and 31 percent, respectively. There were few changes in the percentages of civilian care and mental health providers who were accepting new TRIChare patients. In the 2018/2019 survey, 67 percent of providers reported accepting newTRICare patients if the providers also accepted any other new customers, which was the same percentage as in the 2017 and 2018 surveys. In both surveys, there were no statisticallysignificant changes in providers responses on whether they accepted new patients if other patients were accepted. There also was no significant change from the 2018 to 2019 surveys in the proportion of providers who did not accept new patients for a variety of reasons, such as not accepting reimbursement or the doctor being unavailable or too busy. In addition, in both surveys there was a decrease in the share of providers in non-PSAsareas outside of Prime Service Areas (PSA), which are geographic areas usually within an approximate 40-mile radius of a military inpatient treatment facility, as well as in areas outside of PSA locations, or non- PSAs. There is no statistically Significant Change in the Percentage of Providers Accepting New Patients in Non-PSA Areas (2019 Survey)
In 1994, Executive Order 12898 directed each federal agency to develop an environmental justice strategy that identifies and addresses disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income populations. GAO was asked to review federal environmental justice efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which the 16 working group agencies have developed environmental justice strategic plans and shown progress toward environmental justice goals since 2011; (2) the actions agencies have taken to identify and address environmental justice issues since the executive order was issued and the resources they have used to do so in recent years; and (3) how the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice (working group) has collaborated on efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency environmental justice documents and interviewed federal agency officials and environmental justice stakeholders. Most of the 16 agencies that signed a 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to carry out environmental justice have developed strategic plans that contain strategic goals, but most have not shown clear progress toward these goals. Specifically, 14 of these 16 agencies developed these strategic plans after 2011, when they agreed to develop or update such plans under the 2011 MOU. Of the 14 agencies that developed these plans, 12 also established strategic goals in these plans. However, most of these agencies have not issued annual progress reports or established methods to assess progress toward their goals. In addition, officials from most of the agencies said that they are unable to determine how much progress they have made toward achieving the major requirement from an executive order on environmental justice because they do not have a method for gauging progress. The working group has not provided guidance to agencies on how to assess and report on their environmental justice progress, such as through performance measures. By developing such guidance or creating a committee, the working group could assist agencies in tracking and measuring their progress in achieving their environmentalJustice goals. Most agencies reported taking various actions to identify, address, and use existing resources for environmental justice, including creating data tools and revising processes for public participation and environmental review. For example, in 2015, EPA released its Environmental Justice Mapping and Screening Tool (EJSCREEN), a web-based mapping tool that includes environmental and demographic data at a local level, allowing users to identify potential exposure to environmental pollutants and related health risks across different communities. EPA and the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences have co-funded a collaborative research and data effort called the Centers of Excellence on Environmental Health disparities Research. This effort facilitates research on diseases that are a burden on populations with environmental Justice issues and promotes knowledge sharing among researchers. In 2017, EPA reported tracking how 45 percent of Supplemental Environmental Projects—a type of beneficial environmental project implemented as part of a civil enforcement action settlement—in fiscal year 2017 were in locations with potential environmentalJustice issues. In 2018, EPA proposed to rescind several amendments to its rule requiring facilities using extremely hazardous substances to develop a risk management plan to submit to EPA at least once every 5 years. The rule changes were identified by a Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group composed of the Administrator of EPA, and the department heads of Labor, Homeland Security, Justice, Agriculture, and Transportation, which was created by Executive Order 13650 after chemical facility incidents that resulted in fatalities.
The Stevens Amendment requires federal agencies, including the Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Department of Education (Education), to ensure that all grantees receiving federal funds are in compliance with the statutory requirements of the Stevens Amendment appropriations provision and the agency-communicated conditions of the federal award. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 and the appropriations for these agencies in 2019 renew this requirement for DOL, HHS, and Education. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' management of grant awards. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which these agencies provide guidance to grantees on how to comply with the requirements and (2) how these agencies manage and administer grantees' compliance with these requirements. To do this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials from the three agencies with the largest share of active grant funds in federal fiscal year 2017—DOL, Education, and HHS—as well as eight of the 10 relevant HHS operating divisions. The Departments of Labor, HHS and Education distributed approximately $504 billion in federal grant funding to state and local governments in 2017, or almost 75 percent of the $675 billion total distributed by all federal grant-making agencies that year. Generally, agencies or their subdivisions provided grantees with the exact text of the requirements, paraphrased its language, or in some cases referred grantees to other guidance containing the requirements. DOL's Office of Grants Management (OGM) developed standard terms and conditions that serve as a template for written agreements for grant awards, while HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and Education's Office for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) had their own terms and Conditions that contained the exact language of the amendment's requirements, according to agency officials. OSHA broke the three requirements into four requirements that reflect the full content of the original language, while MSHA had its own Terms and Conditions. The third agency, BLS, told GAO that its grantees only produce narrowly focused press releases and that these documents do not fall within the description of documents “describing projects or programs funded in whole or in part with Federal money.” HHS publishes a Grants Policy Statement that contains language equivalent to the amendment, but it does not quote the amendment verbatim. Consistent with the Stevens amendment, the statement directs grantees that receive federal funds to disclose information on the percentage and dollar amount of federal contributions to their programs or projects in addition to the same information for nongovernmental sources, but collapses the three Stevens Amendment requirements into two requirements with slight wording changes. HHS does not instruct its operating divisions on what to include in their grant award terms and condition. HHS's operating divisions, including HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH), provide grantees for both research and non-research grants and cooperative agreements with general terms andconditions that include a requirement for an “ acknowledgement of federal support” that is an exact re-statement of theStevens Amendment. HHS officials said that they have no knowledge about whether their operating divisions conduct monitoring and enforcement of the statute's requirements for grantee compliance. The remaining HHS operating division in GAO's review, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), stated that its monitoring processes include reviews for Stevens Amendment compliance and that it has a process for reviewing grantee documents. However, none of the operating divisions could demonstrate that they had a process to manage or administer for grantees’ compliance with their Stevens Amendment obligations. In addition, HHS regulations that govern the agency’s grant making state that, “The Federal awarding agency must ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full accordance with U.S. statutory and public policy requirements, including those in general appropriations provisions, and incorporate them either directly or by reference in the terms of the Federal award,” and that the agency must communicate to the non-Federal entity all relevant public policy and statutory requirements. Without having processes to manage and administered their grantees compliance, which is included in HHSs appropriations provision, there is no way for HHS or its operating division to determine whether grantees are in full compliance.
FEMA is the primary federal agency responsible for disaster response and recovery in the United States. Since 2005, GAO has designated it as a high-risk area, in part because of its size, complexity, and long-standing challenges in responding to and recovering from disasters, such as hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Isabel, Isabelle, Wilma, and Wilma II, as well as the 2017 hurricanes and wildfires in California, Texas, Florida, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. GAO was asked to review FEMA's response to the 2017 disasters. This statement summarizes GAO's prior and ongoing work related to (1) the extent to which FEMA has taken steps to strengthen disaster resilience and preparedness, and (2) the challenges that FEMA and other federal agencies face in providing long-term disaster recovery support. This testimony is based on GAO products issued from March 2011 through September 2018, with selected updates conducted in March 2019. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has taken a number of actions to strengthen preparedness and disaster resilience, but additional steps are needed to fully address remaining challenges. For example, in March 2011 GAO reported that FEMA had not completed a comprehensive and measurable national preparedness assessment of capability gaps—for example the amount of resources required to save lives, protect property and the environment, and meet basic human needs after an incident has occurred. Developing such an assessment would help FEMA to identify what capability gaps exist and what level of resources were needed to close such gaps. As of December 2018, FEMA had efforts underway to assess urban area, state, territory, and tribal preparedness capabilities to inform the prioritization of preparedness grant funding; however, the agency had not yet completed an assessment with clear, objective, and quantifiable capability requirements against which to assess preparedness. In addition, in 2015 GAO reviewed selected states' approaches to budgeting for disaster costs to help inform congressional consideration of the balance between federal and state roles in funding disaster assistance. Specifically, none of the 10 states in the review maintained reserves dedicated solely for future disasters, and some state officials reported that they could cover disaster costs without dedicated disaster reserves because they generally relied on the federal government to fund most of the costs associated with disaster response. In September 2018 GAO found that FEMA's efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria were the largest and longest single response in the agency's history. According to FEMA, its response included, among other things, bringing in approximately $1 billion in food and supplies and distributing food, commodities, and medicine via approximately 1,400 flights, which constituted the longest sustained air operations in U. S. disaster history. FEMA officials explained that the agency essentially served as the first responder in the early response efforts and many of the services FEMA provided—such as power restoration, debris removal, and commodity distribution—were typically provided by territorial or local governments. In response to GAO recommendations made in December 2018 and April 2019, FEMA concurred with all of these recommendations and has reported taking actions to begin implementing them. FEMA provides multiple forms of disaster recovery assistance after a major disaster has been declared, including Public Assistance and Individual Assistance. Through these grant programs, FEMA obligates billions of dollars to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments, certain nonprofit organizations, and individuals that have suffered injury or damages from major disaster or emergency incidents, suchas hurricanes, tornados, or wildfires. In recent years, FEMA's Public Assistance program has undergone significant changes as a result of federal legislation and agency initiatives, including a redesigned delivery model for providing grants under the program. However, in September 2017, FEMA expedited full implementation of the redesigned model shortly after Hurricane Harvey made landfall, and in February 2019 GAO also reported on FEMA's transition to using Public Assistance alternative procedures in the USVI and Puerto Rico, which allows the territory to repair and rebuild critical services infrastructure so it meets industry standards without regard to pre-disaster condition. FEMA's workforce management and information technology challenges have exacerbated key issues with its response and Recovery operations. In March 2019, GA O reported that Puerto Rico had established a central recovery office to oversee federal recovery funds and was developing an internal controls plan to help ensure better management and accountability of the funds. In the interim, FEMA has instituted a manual process for reviewing each reimbursement request before providing Public Assistance funds to mitigate risk and help ensure financial accountability. FEMA has also taken some actions to address reported recovery challenges, including additional training for new
FEMA is the primary federal agency responsible for disaster response and recovery in the United States. Since 2005, GAO has designated it as a high-risk area, in part because of its size, complexity, and long-standing challenges. GAO's prior work has identified a number of challenges in FEMA's efforts to respond to and recover from disasters, such as the 2017 hurricanes and wildfires in Texas, Florida, California, and Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). GAO was asked to review FEMA's response to the 2017 disasters. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which FEMA has made progress in addressing prior and ongoing challenges GAO identified in its prior work, and (2) the key issues GAO continues to observe in ongoing work related to FEMA's recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, the USVI, and other areas. This testimony is based on previously issued GAO reports and preliminary observations from ongoing GAO work. To conduct this ongoing work GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents and interviewed federal, state, and local officials. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has taken steps to strengthen disaster resilience and preparedness, but additional steps are needed to fully address remaining challenges. FEMA has taken some actions to improve disaster resilience, but challenges remain. For example, in November 2017, FEMA redesigned the delivery model for providing grants under the Public Assistance program, but GAO found that FEMA had not fully addressed two key information technology management controls that are necessary to ensure systems work effectively and meet user needs. FEMA concurred with these recommendations and has fully implemented the first. However, FEMA has not yet finalized its decision on whether to integrate its new case management system with its current grants management system. As of March 2019, we are awaiting a final decision from officials to determine whether their actions fully address the second recommendation. FEMA's workforce management and information technology challenges have exacerbated key issues with its response to and recovery from the 2017 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as the California wildfires. FEMA faced unprecedented challenges in recruiting, maintaining, and deploying a sufficient and adequately-trained disaster workforce during the three hurricanes and the wildfires, and GAO is continuing to assess these and other workforce challenges. In addition, FEMA's ability to provide effective and affordable short-term housing and sheltering for disaster survivors has been a longstanding and continuing challenge. FEMA provides long-term disaster recovery support through its Public Assistance and Individual Assistance programs, which obligates billions of dollars to state, tribal, territorial and local governments, certain nonprofit organizations, and individuals that have suffered injury or damages from major disaster or emergency incidents, suchAs hurricanes, tornados, or wildfires. In September 2016, GA O reported that, from fiscal years 2005 through 2014, FEMA obligated almost $46 billion for Public Assistance grants and over $25 billion for Individual Assistance grants. In its ongoing work, which focuses on FEMA's management of its Public assistance programs, GA omits some of the key challenges that GAO reported in its March 2019 report on the status of recovery efforts for Puerto Rico (GAO-19-256 ) and continues to monitor FEMA's progress in responding to and recovering from the hurricanes. In March 2019 GAO also reported that Puerto Rico officials' concerns about FEMA staff turnover and lack of knowledge among FEMA staff about how Public Assistance alternative procedures are to be applied in Puerto Puerto Rico continue. As part of ongoing work on Puerto Rico's recovery, in April 2019, FEMA removed the manual reimbursement process and began a transition to allow the central recovery office to take responsibility for review and reimbursement approval of federal recovery funds to help ensure better management and accountability of the funds. FEMA officials stated that the agency is taking actions to address reported recovery challenges, including additional training for new FEMA employees and drafting supplemental guidance for the alternative procedures process. In May 2019, in its report on FEMA disaster assistance to older adults and people with disabilities following the hurricanes, GAo found that aspects of the application process for FEMA assistance were challenging for older individuals and those with disabilities and recommended, among other things, that FEMA improve its ability to identify and address survivors' disability-related needs and improve communication of registrants' disability information across FEMA programs. FEMA agreed with the first recommendation and is taking steps to address it, but did not concur with the second.
The Department of Defense (DOD) is in the midst of a multibillion-dollar acquisition effort to modernize its space systems, including satellites, ground systems, and user equipment. DOD's space systems support a wide range of capabilities to a large number of users, including the military services, the intelligence community, civil agencies, and others. These capabilities include positioning, navigation, and timing; meteorology; missile warning; and secure communications, among others. DOD is also in the beginning phases of acquiring several constellations of new satellites and ground processing capabilities--including for missile warning, protected communications, space-based environmental monitoring, and space command and control. In addition, DOD is exploring alternatives for acquiring wideband satellite communications as well as funding development of new launch vehicles as it pursues a new acquisition strategy for procuring launch services. GAO's prior work has shown that many major DOD space programs have experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays. For instance, the total program cost for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite program, a protected satellite communications system, has grown 117 percent since the program's original cost estimate and its first satellite was launched more than 3.5 years late. For the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), a missile warning satellite system, the program cost grew 265 percent from its original estimate and the launch of the first satellite has been delayed roughly 9 years. The Global Positioning System (GPS) III satellite program has seen an almost 4-year delay due to technical issues and program cost growth of about 32 percent. DOD faces a number of challenges as it continues to acquire new space systems. First, it is confronted with growing threats in space, which may require very different satellite architectures and acquisition strategies. Second, the department is planning major changes to its leadership for space. While these changes are designed to streamline decision-making and bring together a dispersed space workforce, they could cause some disruption to space system acquisition programs. Third, in fiscal year 2016, Congress gave DOD authority to speed up acquisition timeframes by streamlining acquisition processes and oversight. For space, challenges with past streamlining efforts may offer some lessons learned. For example, in the 1990s, DOD implemented Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR), which gave a contractor total responsibility for the integration of an entire weapon system and for meeting DOD's requirements. Because this reform made the contractor responsible for day-to-day program management, DOD did not require formal deliverable documents--such as earned value management reports--to assess the status and performance of the contractor. As a result, DOD's capability to lead and manage the space acquisition process diminished, which magnified problems related to unstable requirements and poor contractor performance. Fourth, DOD may face resource and capacity challenges in taking on multiple space acquisitions at one time. DOD has begun over 9 new acquisition programs in the past 2 years to recapitalize current space capabilities and enhance system resiliency. It is also boosting efforts to increase space situational awareness and protect space assets, and it is considering additional significant acquisitions in wideband satellites and in support of missile defense activities. While there is increased attention within DOD on funding for space and building the Space Force, such widespread acquisition activities could still pose resource challenges. Funding requests for space system modernization have in the last 10 years represented a small percentage (3.9 to 5 percent) of total weapon system modernization funding requested.
The National Park Service (NPS) is responsible for the overall organization and execution of Fourth of July events on the National Mall, including the National Independence Day Parade; A Capitol Fourth Concert; the Independence Day Fireworks Display; and, in 2019, A Salute to America, an event in front of the Lincoln Memorial that included military band performances, a military display, a speech by the President of the United States, military aircraft flyovers, and a fireworks display. For 2016 through 2019, NPS, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the District of Columbia Government (DC Government) are estimated to have spent over $1 billion on these events. GAO was asked to review the costs of the events. This report describes (1) the total costs that federal agencies and state and local jurisdictions incurred and (2) the appropriations that were used to pay for the estimated federal costs; the extent, if any, to which the federal government has reimbursed costs incurred by state or local jurisdictions; and the extent to which federal agencies delayed, deferred, or canceled other programs or activities as a result of resources being used for Fourth ofJuly events. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documentation, such as financial data, contracts, and relevant agreements, and interviewed officials from NPS and other federal, state, and local entities that contributed resources to the events, as well as officials from the Executive Office of the President (EOP), Department of the Interior, Department of Homeland Security, Capitol Police, Architect of the Capitol, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, Smithsonian Institution, American Red Cross, and Department of Energy. According to estimates GAO obtained, federal agencies spent millions of dollars annually for the National July 4th events from 2016 to 2019. These costs included costs for the Capitol Fourth concert, the parade, the fireworks display, and other activities. For example, according to GAO's review of agency documents and interviews with agency officials, the Capitol July 4 concert cost an estimated $4 million annually from 2016 through 2018. The Capitol Fourth concerts and fireworks display event costs were estimated from $253,000 to $409,000 annually from 2015 through 2019. For the Salutes to America event, the estimated cost was $4.3 million, primarily for the cost of a private entity to plan and execute the event. The cost of that contract was approximately $2.45 million and was funded with NPS appropriations through a Memorandum of Agreement with EOP. The Secret Service used numerous special agents from its Washington, D.C., Field Office and incurred overtime pay and cost for materials to prepare for and execute security for the event, which included the use of the National Guard and the Federal Protective Service (FPS) to protect the event area. The NPS provided minimal operations support to the entity that produced the concert but was responsible for funding the concert from its annual appropriations and with additional funding that the Army provides each year. The DC Government received an appropriation each fiscal year for emergency planning and security costs that remains available until expended. This appropriation is for the costs for providing public safety at events related to the presence of the national capital in the district. Accordingto DC Government officials, DC Government obligated the entire amount appropriated in fiscal year 2019 for the various events in the District. Park Police reimbursed local law enforcement outside of the District for assistance with security, traffic, and crowd control, costs which were estimated to be between $85,000 and $132,000 per year from 2016-2019. DC Government did not request additional appropriations from Congress because they used funds from other appropriations to cover the cost for events exceeding the fiscal year2019 appropriation. The Department of Justice provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate.
The Federal Protective Service (FPS) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a key role in protecting federal facilities and the people who work in and visit them. FPS was established in the 1970s as part of the General Services Administration (GSA) to provide physical security and law enforcement services at federal facilities. Following the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 created DHS and moved FPS from GSA to the new department, where it was placed in U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where its responsibilities grew beyond solely protecting GSA buildings to include homeland security activities such as implementing homeland security directives and providing law-enforcement, security, and emergency-response services during natural disasters and special events. In 2009, DHS proposed transferring FPS from ICE to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) within DHS and placing it in the Office of Infrastructure Protection to further solidify NPPD as DHS's lead for critical infrastructure protection. In November 2018, legislation was enacted that reorganized NPPD to an organization that had a greater statutory focus on managing cyber risks and authorized DHS to determine the appropriate placement for FPS within NPPD and begin transfer of FPS to that entity. In January 2019, GAO reported that DHS was similar to FPS in that its mission statement and goals as stated in its strategic plan include an explicit focus on the protection of infrastructure or specific facilities. GAO's prior work found that placing an agency into an organization with a similar mission might help ensure that the agency's mission receives adequate funding, attention, visibility, and support. This testimony discusses (1) the key criteria for evaluating organizational placement and (2) considerations for FPS's placement in DHS's Management Directorate. This statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from 2002 through 2019 related to organizational and accountability criteria for establishing DHS, as well as selected updates conducted in January 2019 on the status of DHS's efforts to implement recommendations GAO made in these prior reports. For its January 2019 report on organizational placement in the Management Directorate of DHS, which focused on eight agencies that could be potential placement options for FPS (see GAO-2019-10-827T ), GAO applied key criteria that are relevant to assessing potential placements for FPS. For the first four criteria--mission, goals, and objectives; responsibilities; organizational culture; information sharing and coordination; and mission support--GAO determined that DHS met the criteria if the agency or its subcomponents had any similarities to FPS or could provide FPS needed mission support. For example, in September 2011, GA O reported that FPS, Marshals, and other agencies involved in protecting courthouses (i.e., GSA and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts) faced challenges related to coordination, such as in the implementation of roles and responsibilities and the use or participation in existing collaboration mechanisms. FPS owned and used many of the key operational and business-related information technology (IT) systems and applications it needs to carry out its mission. For instance, FPS used a financial management IT system owned by ICE and DHS could provide it access to financial management systems that can support FPS. Finally, FPS offered its own training courses and would still need access to DHS's Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. In its prior work on organizational and management changes in DHS that GAO identified in May 2012 and July 2003, both GAO found that none of the selected agencies met all the organizational placement criteria; thus, any of the organizational placements could result in both benefits and trade-offs. In instances where placing FPS within DHS met GAO criteria (that is, instances where DHS wassimilar to FPS), FPS could experience benefits. In those instances where the criteria were not met, it would be incumbent upon any agency to consider and address any potential tradeoffs in order to ensure the decision was successful. For FPS as a "standalone" entity reporting directly to the Deputy Secretary of DHS and found this placement option met several key criteria. In addition, in July 2003 GAO noted key practices and implementation steps for mergers and organizational transformations intended to help agencies transform their cultures so that they can be more results oriented, customer focused, and collaborative in nature.
DHS plays a critical role in protecting the United States and its people from threats to national security, homeland security, and public safety. In fiscal year 2019, DHS is the third-largest cabinet-level department in the federal government, with more than 200,000 employees and an annual budget of more than $50 billion. GAO has designated DHS's management of human capital as a high-risk area in part because of its size, complexity, and importance of its work to the nation's security and economic well-being. This statement discusses DHS's progress in (1) improving employee morale and engagement, (2) enhancing information technology security through improved workforce planning, and (3) strengthening management functions. It is based on GAO's past and ongoing work examining DHS's human capital management and workforce planning. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents, and interviewed DHS officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken steps to improve its employee engagement scores but still falls below the government-wide average. For example, DHS's Employee Engagement Index (EEI) score, which measures employees' views on leadership, supervisors, and intrinsic work experience, has increased over the last 4 years, from a low of 53 percent in 2015 to 62 percent in 2019. However, other DHS component agencies continue to rank among the lowest across the government in the Partnership for Public Service rankings of employee satisfaction and commitment. As a result, continuing to increase employee engagement and morale remains important to strengthening DHS's ability to implement its missions. DHS's Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) and the components have taken action to use employees' input from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) to inform and implement initiatives targeted at improving employee engagement. OCHCO has conducted audits to better ensure components are basing hiring decisions and promotions on human capital competencies and individual performance and has considered this outcome fully addressed since 2017. DHS has also established employee engagement initiatives across the department, such as initiatives for employees and their families that aim to increase awareness and access to support programs, benefits, and resources. In addition, DHS components have continued to develop these employee engagement action plans and several report implementing initiatives to enhance employee engagement, including a sponsorship program for all newly hired and recently relocated employees and a need for increased engagement between employees and component leadership. DHS also continues to identify and address the root causes of employee engagement issues and has taken actions to address some of these root causes. For instance, in 2019, the Transportation Security Administration identified the performance of managers, time constraints and understaffing, and lack of manager and leadership accountability for change as root causes for the component's engagement scores in recent years. DHS continues to address these root cause issues and is in the process of developing a plan to address them.
Rule of law assistance is a key component of U.S. foreign policy to promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in partner countries. GAO was asked to review the provision of this assistance. This report examines (1) how much funding the Department of State (State) and USAID allocated for this assistance in fiscal years 2014 through 2018; (2) how agencies strategically plan and coordinate the allocation; and (3) what processes agencies have to design, implement, and coordinate programs in selected countries. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed State, USAID, DOJ, and Department of Defense (DOD) funding and obligation data for the four countries GAO selected for review—Colombia, Kosovo, Liberia, the Philippines, and Ghana—and interviewed officials in Washington, D.C.; Colombia; Ghana; Liberia; Kosovo; and the Philippines. State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated more than $2.7 billion for Rule of Law Assistance in fiscal year 2018, mostly to programs in Afghanistan and the Western Hemisphere. The Department of Justice (DOJ) obligated $691 million from fiscal year 2014 through July 2019 to implement certain programs, such as the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) and the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT). According to DOJ, ICITAP and OPDAT provide a comprehensive approach to criminal justice reform in countries with both a Resident Legal Advisor and an ICITap advisor. According to USAID officials, OPDat builds foreign partners who can work with the U. S. agencies to enhance cooperation in transnational cases and to fight crime before it reaches the UnitedStates. In selected countries, State, DOJ and the Department's Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) developed interagency strategies and two issue-specific strategies to guide rule-of-law assistance. The mission-wide strategies for the selected countries varied in how they prioritized rule- of- law assistance. For example, in Kosovo, the mission's Integrated Country Strategy (ICS) lists two objectives that help achieve the goal of improved rule oflaw: ensuring that all Kosovo's citizens have access to reliable, transparent, and accountable governance and justice and that it is responsive to citizens' needs, and improving delivery of services, implementation of laws and regulations, and committing to countering corruption. In Colombia, the goal to advance Colombia's capacity to strengthen governance includes the objective of extending the effective presence of democratic institutions and processes. In Kosovo, in addition to the ICS and CDCS, in-country missions may develop strategies to address a specific priority. In the Philippines and Liberia, missions developed additional strategic documents specific to rule of Law assistance. Agencies in the four selected countries use similar processes to design and implement rule ofLaw assistance, but the extent to which interagency coordination mechanisms are sufficient is unknown. Agency officials, led by the Chief of Mission, at overseas embassies have not assessed the sufficiency of coordination mechanisms at overseas posts or ensured that such coordination includes all relevant agencies and bureaus. Given that strategic guidance is largely decentralized, country-level coordination and collaboration efforts are critical to achieving agency and government-wide objectives. Without assessing the suiciency of a mission's coordination mechanisms, such mechanisms may not be as effective as they could be, and may also increase the risk of duplicating efforts or fragmenting limited resources. In addition, agencies may also be missing opportunities to leverage interagency resources.
GAO was asked to review ETA's use of bridge contracts to operate Job Corps centers. Bridge contracts are short-term contracts awarded to an incumbent contractor to avoid a lapse in service and serve as a mechanism to “bridge services” until the next follow-on contract can be competitively awarded. GAO's prior work has found that bridge contracts can be a useful tool to ensure that there is no lapse in services provided to Job Corps students, but GAO has also found that when noncompetitive bridge contracts are used frequently or for prolonged periods of time, the government is at risk of paying more than it should for products and services. This report examines (1) the extent to which, and why, ETA used bridge contracts during program year 2016; (2) the strategies ETA has used to decrease its use of non competitive bridge contracts; and (3) how ETA monitored contractor performance at selected centers. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), conducted a nongeneralizable in-depth review of 10 centers that operated under bridge or noncompetitive contracts, and interviewed ETA officials. The Department of Labor's (DOL) Employment and Training Administration (ETA) operated 68 of the 97 Job Corps center contracts in program years 2016 and 2017 under bridge contracts. ETA cited several reasons that contributed to its need to use bridge contracts, including acquisition workforce challenges and protests by Job Corps contractors. For example, in the written justification and approval documents for bridge contracts related to 42 of the 68 centers that were operated under a bridge contract in program year 2015, Eta officials cited protests from Job Corps offerors as a reason for using bridge contracts in 2016. In addition, in 2016, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) included provisions that affected the Job Corps contracting process, including requiring that certain criteria be considered when selecting an entity to operate the centers. WIOA issued regulations implementing these provisions in August 2016. Additionally, in written justification documents related to 34 of 68 bridge contracts for program years 2015 and 2016, E TA officials noted that they diverted staff from awarding Job Corps procurements to address financial issues encountered by the program. In response to GAO and DOL's Office of Inspector General reports on earlier problems with ETA financial management oversight of Job Corps, which led to ETA obligating funds that had yet to be appropriated across multiple years, the agency said that it provided training to its program and contracting staff in 2016 to help ensure they understood how to administer future contracts. According to contracting and program officials GAO spoke with, the challenges ETA faced in managing its acquisition workforce in 2016 contributed to the need to rely heavily on bridge contracts and that ongoing acquisition planning and workforce challenges could pose risks to its ability to manage and award future Job Corps contracts in a way that avoids a reliance on these contracts in the future. Specifically, in 2017, we project that more than half of the recently awarded competitive contracts may expire and services will need to be re-solicited in future program years. A comprehensive strategy that accounts for Job Corps' current and future workload could help ETA better anticipate its workforce needs in critical positions, and thereby help to reduce its risk of relying on these bridge contracts later down the road. In the absence of such a strategy, it is likely that ETA is likely to be back in the same position it was 3 years ago, when more than two-thirds of its centers were operating under some form of bridge contract. To encourage contractors to meet or exceed performance outcomes, EA used various monitoring and contracting tools, including incentive fees, to encourage them to operate centers. However, program officials we spoke with were not aware of how these incentive fees had been calculated and paid. In 2009, the Office of Financial Administration developed guidance that states incentive strategies should be developed through close collaboration among the contracting officer and other key staff. Further, federal internal control standards state that agency leadership should document operational processes in policies, and communicate these policies to key personnel so that they can implement their assigned responsibilities.
VA provides health care services to veterans through its health care system, including through the VCCP, which is a consolidated system of integrated service networks that includes VA medical facilities and community providers. In June 2018, GAO reported that VA faced challenges in ensuring veterans' timely access to care under the Choice Program, which allows veterans to obtain care from community providers when a VA medical facility cannot provide an appointment within 30 days, or when veterans reside more than 40 miles from the nearest VA facility or face other travel burdens. GAO made five recommendations to VA to address the factors that adversely affected veterans' access to Choice Program care. VA agreed or agreed in principle with all five recommendations and has taken some steps in response to these recommendations. However, these recommendations remain unimplemented as of July 2019. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which VA has addressed GAO's prior recommendations related to VA's appointment scheduling and wait-time measurement and (2) VA's efforts to address other factors that could adversely affect veterans' availability of care. This statement is based on prior GAO work issued from December 2012 through June 2018. To conduct this work, GA O reviewed relevant VA policies, procedures, and data and interviewed VA officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has taken a number of actions to address deficiencies GAO identified in prior work related to appointment scheduling, wait- time measurement, and implementation of its scheduling policy, but additional actions are needed. For example, in July 2016, VA issued an updated scheduling policy that provided clarification on scheduling roles and responsibilities for implementing the policy and business rules for scheduling appointments, such as using the electronic wait list, and required biannual scheduler audits. VA also ensured almost all schedulers received training on the updated policy and improved oversight through audits, as previously described. In addition, VA plans to rapidly deploy a single nationwide scheduling system that is intended to simplify the operating environment and may mitigate challenges identified in the 2012 report. The new scheduling system will be a resource-based system where each provider's schedule is visible on one screen, instead of requiring the need to toggle through multiple screens as it currently exists. VA is expected to roll out the new system starting in 2020, which will be implemented in coordination with the planned modernization of the electronic health records system across VA facilities. VA has taken steps to address GAO recommendations to improve its wait-Time Measurement and scheduling policy. In December 2012, VA reported that outpatient medical appointment wait times reported by VA were unreliable, and, therefore, VA was unable to identify areas that needed improvement or mitigate problems for veterans attempting to access care. In response, VA developed a new wait time measurement system in June 2010, which measures wait times as the number of days elapsed from the desired date—the date on which the patient or health care provider wants the patient to be seen—to the date of the appointment. VA's scheduling policy and training documents for recording desired date were unclear and did not ensure consistency. VA subsequently introduced new terms with similar definitions—from “desired date” to “preferred date,” without fundamentally addressing the deficiency. In August 2018, VA completed its first internal system-wide audit of wait time data and scheduling, which was intended to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the data, but VA was not able to determine the accuracy or reliability of these data because it could not obtain the rules for calculating wait times. In July 2019, VA provided GAO additional updates on efforts to implement its related recommendations. In September 2017, VA began implementing an interim solution to monitor overall wait times, but this solution relied on VA medical center staff consistently and accurately entering data on referrals, a process that is prone to error. VA officials stated that they are developing a new monitoring mechanism that will be fully implemented across all VA facilities by fiscal year 2021. In March 2018, the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (MISSION Act of 2018) required VA to implement a permanent community care program—the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP)—to provide veterans with the option to receive care from a community provider when VA cannot provide care in a timely manner. The Act required GAO to review VA's implementation of this program in June 2019. In May 2019 GAO began work to review how VA will address issues such as appointment scheduling. VA began implementation of the V CCP on June 6, 2019, and GAO has ongoing work related
Effective management of federal agency records is important for efficient government operations: it ensures that sufficient documentation is created; that agencies can efficiently locate and retrieve records needed in the daily performance of their missions; and that records of historical significance are identified, preserved, and made available to the public. The Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 included a provision for GAO to review federal agencies' electronic records management. GAO examined the extent to which (1) selected agencies' policies and procedures address electronic recordkeeping requirements and (2) NARA assisted selected agencies in managing their electronic records. To address these objectives, GAO selected 17 agencies based on the number of employees and categorized them as small and micro agencies. These agencies were selected based on, among other things, whether they had established a Senior Agency Official for Records Management and submitted an annual report on NARA's website between fiscal years 2015 and 2017. The 17 agencies varied in the extent that their records management policies, procedures, and documentation addressed 10 key requirements in the Managing Government Records Directive and its amendments and implementing regulations related to electronic records, such as managing permanent and temporary email records in an electronic format. Specifically, most of the selected agencies addressed the requirements related to establishing records management programs, submitting records schedules to the National Archives of the United States (NARA), incorporating activities for electronic records into their overall records management program, developing plans for managing permanent electronic records in electronic format, managing email records, and using non-official electronic messaging. However, agencies did not fully address the requirements for maintaining an inventory of electronic information systems, establishing controls and preservation considerations for their electronic systems, and issuing retention and management requirements for email. NARA provided various forms of guidance and assistance to the 17 selected agencies, including issuing guidance and assigning an archivist to assist each agency. In addition, NARA monitored the agencies' compliance with records management regulations and implementation of policies, guidance, and other records management best practices through its self-assessment program. For example, in calendar year 2017, four of the 17 agencies were assessed as being at high risk of not complying with statutory and regulatory records management requirements—the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, Marine Mammal Commission, Presidio Trust, and the Udall Foundation—because they did not submit a comprehensive list of records and schedules of records to the Archivist. While NARA requires agencies to self- assess their programs annually, it does not ensure that agencies that score poorly on their self- Assessments develop a plan to improve their programs or monitor their progress in such efforts. Given the self-Assessment process was designed to measure agency compliance and to target resources to areas needing improvement, it is important that NARA ensure the small or micro agencies that have assessed their programs as high-risk are taking appropriate actions to improve the programs. Until these agencies do so, they will lack assurance that electronic records are being managed in a way that promotes openness and accountability.
In 2017, about 26 million people—roughly one in 10 adults in the U.S. population—cared for their parent or spouse, and about 22 million people cared for other relatives, such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, or non-related adults, according to the American Time Use Survey. GAO was asked to review issues related to caregiving. This report (1) examines what is known about the size and characteristics of the parental and spousal caregiving population, including differences among women and men; (2) examines the extent to which caregiving affects retirement security; and (3) identifies and discusses policy options and initiatives that could improve caregivers' retirement security. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from three nationally representative surveys, conducted an extensive literature review, and interviewed experts and stakeholders. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The Social Security Administration told GAO they had no comments on the draft report. In 2017, an estimated 45 million people per year provided unpaid eldercare (caregiving) to a parent or a spouse or a parent-in-law or spouse to help them take care of themselves or an adult who needed help because of a condition related to aging. About 88 percent of these caregivers (23.4 million people) provided care for a parent, and 12 percent provided care to a spouse. Women and minorities tended to provide care more frequently than men, and those with lower levels of education and earnings were more likely to provide daily care than those with higher education and higher earnings. About two-thirds of parental caregivers were married, and almost all spousals were married. Spousal caregivers tended to have lower retirement assets and lower Social Security income than non-caregivers, but the differences were not statistically significant. For example, women caregivers had 37 to 54 percent less in Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) assets and non-IRA assets--such as real estate or stocks--than men who did not provide care. Women caregivers also had 15 percent less social security income compared to men. Many older Americans rely on Social Security for a significant portion of their retirement income. Therefore, a lower social security benefit could have serious consequences for these individuals' financial security. Experts said a comprehensive framework that incorporates actions across policy categories could improve the retirement security of parental or spousAL caregivers. These policy categories can be grouped into four categories: 1) decrease caregivers' out-of-pocket expenses, 2) increase caregivers' workforce attachment and wage preservation, 3) increase caregiver access or contributions to retirement accounts, and 4) increase their Social Security benefits. Experts GAO interviewed identified potential benefits of each of the four policy categories. They also identified specific groups of caregivers who could benefit, including women, lower-income caregivers, and working caregivers. Experts also said all four categories have potential costs and challenges, including determining who would be responsible for implementing and funding certain actions, defining caregiving for benefit eligibility, and identifying and verifying a caregiver's status.
The Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960 established a system of compulsory pilotage in the waters of the Great Lakes-Seaway that requires all oceangoing commercial vessels to use U.S. or Canadian registered pilots during their transit through regulated waters. The Coast Guard is responsible for regulating pilotage and setting pilotage rates. In 2016, the Coast Guard initiated a number of changes to its pilotage rate-setting methodology that were intended, in part, to provide sufficient pilot compensation to attract, hire, and retain appropriate numbers of qualified Great Lakes pilots. However, some pilots and shipping industry stakeholders have raised concerns that these changes did not provide sufficient compensation and resulted in pilot shortages and shipping delays. GAO was asked to review issues related to Great Lakes pilotage. This report examines (1) the extent to which Coast Guard obtains stakeholder input on the program and issues identified by stakeholders and pilots, and (2) potential alternatives to the current structure and governance of the pilotage system and potential tradeoffs associated with these alternatives. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and Coast Guard documents, and interviewed Coast Guard and pilot representatives. The Department of Homeland Security provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated into the report. The Great Lakes Coast Guard (Coast Guard) uses several mechanisms to obtain input from shipping industry and pilot industry stakeholders on the Great lakes pilotage program, and stakeholders have used these mechanisms to raise a variety of issues for consideration. Formal mechanisms include obtaining stakeholder comments during the rulemaking process and soliciting input during annual meetings. Other mechanisms, such as ad-hoc communications and operational coordination efforts, are employed on an as-needed basis. Stakeholders and pilots have identified a numberof issues, or suggestions, that they would like to see integrated within the program since 2016. Issues identified by pilots and their representatives include updating the list of "designated waters" to include areas like Great Lakes ports and addressing changes that may be needed to respond to the increasing volume and variety of vessels needing pilotage services such as cruise ships. In addition, some of these issues remain the subject of ongoing litigation initiated by a coalition of industry stakeholders against the United States Coast Guard. Some of the issues are related to the financial impacts associated with the program's methodology for calculating rates, as well as other areas where enhanced oversight is suggested. For example, pilots' representatives have raised issues regarding the timeliness and transparency of financial information provided by the pilot associations that is used in the process of setting rates. Some stakeholders have also suggested that it is time to evaluate potential governance alternatives to help ensure the pilotageshipping system is efficient, cost-effective, and better serves the needs of the maritime industry and the public. Proposed alternatives include changes that could be implemented within the existing governance system such as the consolidation of the three existing pilotage districts and a review of some pilotage requirements. Other changes would entail more sweeping reforms and require statutory changes. Finally, some proposals would reflect an even more significant change from the existing model of pilotage consisting of federal oversight and economic regulation of independent pilot associations, known as a regulated monopoly.
The federal government faces long-standing challenges in strategically managing its workforce. In addition to strategic human capital management, skills gaps played a role in 16 of the 34 other high-risk areas on GAO's 2019 High-Risk List, including information technology management and acquisitions and veterans' health care. GAO has also designated as priority 29 of its prior recommendations to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) because, upon implementation, they may have an especially significant impact on OPM's operations. Twenty-one of these priority recommendations are aimed at addressing government-wide human capital challenges, including some of the ones discussed above. This testimony focuses on (1) the structural challenges facing the federal human capital system and (2) key strategies that agencies can use to recruit, develop, and retain a high-performing workforce and better meet their missions in a tight labor market. This statement is based on prior GAO work issued from January 2010 through March 2019 and selected updates conducted in March 2019. The government's system of current employment policies was designed generations ago for a workforce and types of work that largely no longer exist. Much has changed since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the Classification Act of 1949 laid the foundation of today's federal personnel system. We have identified several structural challenges that impede the ability of agencies to recruit and retain employees, both today and in the future. For example: Classification system. The General Schedule classification system--which defines and organizes federal positions, primarily to assign rates of pay--has not kept pace with the government's evolving requirements. Recruiting and hiring. Federal agencies need a hiring process that is applicant friendly and flexible, and meets policy requirements. Pay system. Employees are compensated through an outmoded system that rewards length of service rather than individual performance and contributions, and automatically provides across-the-board annual pay increases, even to poor performers. Performance management. Agencies have faced long- standing challenges developing modern, credible, and effective employee performance management systems and dealing with poor performers and gaps in leadership and institutional knowledge. In the 2017 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), 64 percent of federal employee respondents agreed that their supervisor provides them with constructive suggestions to improve job performance. Without effective performance management, agencies risk not only losing the skills of top talent, they also risk missing the opportunity to effectively address increasingly complex and evolving mission challenges. Training. Training can help ensure agencies have the talent capacity to address evolving mission requirements and negative perceptions by some of federal work (e.g., that it is too bureaucratic). For example, agencies can cultivate a diverse talent pipeline through strategic partnerships with academic and other institutions, highlight their respective missions, recruit early in the school year, support rotations, and assign talent where needed. Incentivize and compensate employees. While federal agencies may struggle to offer competitive pay in certain labor markets, they can leverage existing incentives that appeal to workers' desire to set a schedule and to work in locations that provide work-life balance. However, agencies do not always promote these benefits and incentives as part of a total compensation package, in part because managers are not always aware of the importance of doing so. Some agencies are addressing this issue by advertising and helping employees use available benefits.
The boards that oversee the Social Security and Medicare trust funds are technically separate entities, but the same set of trustees have served as board members for each trust fund and the boards meet concurrently. For each board, four of the trustees are ex officio, i.e. members by virtue of their office and position. The remaining two trustees are members of the public, nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and the public trustees must not be from the same political party as one another. The public trustee positions were established in 1983; they have been vacant since 2015. The boards issue two separate Trustees reports each year, one on Social Security trust funds and one on Medicare. The reports provide information on the present and projected statuses of the trust funds, including their projected balances over the next 10 years (short-term), the next 75 years (long-term) and the assumptions and methods used to make these projections. GAO was asked to review the process for developing the reports. This report examines (1) the extent to which the boards have met the statutory deadline to issue the reports by April 1 each year and (2) how the boards manage the report-development schedule. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials and former public trustees. The Social Security Administration's (SSA) Office of the Chief Actuary and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS OACT) work with other agency officials to develop assumptions and draft and revise the Trustee reports in an annual cycle, according to agency officials, board meeting minutes, and report development schedules. SSA OCACT and CMS OACT officials said they work to update the assumptions--both long-term and short-term--they propose as the basis for the trust fund projections in the reports, such as fertility rates and growth in gross domestic product. For example, in the 2017 Social Security Trustees report, the model for projecting average age benefit levels of retired worker and disabled worker beneficiaries who are newly entitled to benefits used a sample of these beneficiaries from 2013. In the 2018 report, this model was updated to use a sample from 2015. In recent years, the boards issued the reports to Congress after the April 1 statutory deadline in 17 of the 25 years from 1995 to 2019, including every year from 2009 through 2019. Since 2009, the reports have been issued at least 2 months late six times, including in 2010, when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), enacted on March 23, 2010, significantly contributed to the 2010 reports being issued over 4 months past the deadline. Agency officials told GAO that they may delay reports in order to include the impact of late-breaking legislation or policy changes on the assumptions or data, or for other reasons. However, agency officials stated that they do not have a policy or practice of informing Congress of delays or changes to the schedules for the reports even in years when the reports are issued months after the deadline, which may hinder Congress's ability to conduct oversight and make decisions about these important programs. The process for managing the report development schedule for the trustees reports is inconsistent with GAO's guide on best practices for schedule management. According to best practices, the final iteration of the schedule that was actually followed should be archived and used to inform and improve future schedules. Treasury officials were able to provide GAO with the archived, updated schedules for only 6 of the last 25 years, and these schedules were incomplete. While these updated schedules showed the actual dates that the draft reports were provided and the planned dates for later milestones, they did not include the dates for milestones before the draft report was provided or the actual date that the reports were issued, including the reports' issuance dates. Further, although the boards regularly missed the statutory deadlines, the initial report- development schedules have not significantly changed in recent years. Without recording the actual report production schedule that is followed, participating officials do not know the historical data that would assist them in making meaningful and effective changes to future schedules, and it is important that stakeholders, including decision makers, have access to information on project progress.
Recovery homes—peer-run and peer-managed supportive homes—are peer-run, nonclinical living environments for individuals recovering from substance abuse and substance abuse (SUD) treatment and recovery. These homes may be referred to as "recovery homes" or "sober homes" by treatment providers, the criminal justice system, or residents themselves. GAO was asked to review issues related to recovery homes. In March 2018, GAO reported on (1) the prevalence of recovery homes nationwide, (2) the extent to which selected states have investigated potential fraud related to these homes and taken steps to enhance oversight, and (3) steps taken by three of the five selected states to increase oversight. This testimony is based on GAO's March 2018 report ( GAO-18-854 ) on recovery homes and provides information on the extent of fraud and oversight in selected states. To conduct this work GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and other documents and interviewed officials from the Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and state and local officials in Florida, Massachusetts, Utah, Ohio, and Texas. In its March 2018 review of recovery home programs in five states (Florida, Massachusetts; Ohio; Utah; Texas; and Ohio), GAO found that there was no complete nationwide picture of the prevalence or characteristics of these homes because complete data are not collected at the federal level to provide a nationwide picture, in part, because there is no federal agency responsible for overseeing them. However, two national organizations with missions dedicated to recovery Homes collect data on the prevalence and characteristics for a sub-set of recovery Homes and the number of homes that were not affiliated with these organizations was unknown. As of January 2018, one of these organizations reported that there were 2,542 recovery homes (known as Oxford Houses) in 45 states. Since 2007, officials from four of five states GAO selected for review told GAO that since 2007, state agencies had conducted, or were in the process of conducting, law enforcement investigations of unscrupulous behavior and potential insurance fraud. Officials from these four states said that the potential fraud may have relied on unscrupulous relationships between SUD treatment providers (including laboratories that perform tests to check for substance use) and recovery home operators. For example, treatment providers may form relationships with recovery homes who then recruit individuals with SUD in order to refer or require residents to see the specific treatment providers. In addition, recovery homes may encourage residents to participate in mutual aid or self-help groups (e.g., 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous) and may require that residents submit to drug screening to verify their sobriety. The extent of potential fraud differed across the four states. Officials in Florida described investigations into fraud in the recovery home industry as extensive, although the scope of the fraud within the industry is unknown. In Utah, officials said the department had not been able to file charges against any treatment providers because it had been unable to collect the necessary evidence to do so, but in 2016, Utah enacted legislation that gave insurers and state regulatory agencies the authority to review patient records and investigate providers that bill insurers. Three of the selected states—Florida (2015), Massachusetts (2014), and Utah (2014)—have established state certification or licensure programs for recovery homes, and two states (Ohio and Texas) are taking other steps to support recovery homes by providing technical assistance and other resources to increase consistency, accountability, and quality. In Florida and Massachusetts, the state-established programs require that certain providers refer patients only to homes that are certified or licensed by their state program; therefore, uncertified and unlicensed homes are ineligible to receive patient referrals from certain treatment providers in these states. In Ohio and Texas, the states have not established state oversight programs, but officials said their states have provided technical assistance to homes in an effort to increase quality and consistency.
DOD's 17 depots maintain a wide range of weapon systems and equipment for the Department of Defense (DOD) and play a key role in sustaining military readiness. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to share best practices and lessons learned among the depots. This report examines the extent to which DOD experiences benefits and has challenges with (1) sharing and (2) implementing best practices among the depot maintenance community. To conduct this work, GAO surveyed all 17 of DOD's major depot-level maintenance depots, reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance, and conducted site visits to a non-generalizable sample of five depots selected based on geographic location, military service representation, and types of weapon system maintained, and interviewed DOD and military service officials. DOD experiences Benefits from Sharing Best Practices and Lessons Learned among the Depots, but Communication and Organization Challenges Exist. DOD shares best practices through a variety of venues, including networking, working groups, and benchmarking. However, DOD has communication challenges, including a lack of awareness of many sharing venues, which may hinder the ability of depots to share. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has not created, shared, or maintained a comprehensive and updated list of all depot-specific DOD sharing venues (i.e., working groups) that includes points of contact. Without a centralized list, it is unclear what groups exist and who to contact to participate. Further, while the Army stated it established lessons learned organizations for sharing materiel best practices, it did not maintain these organizations due to organizational restructuring and resource constraints. Establishing and maintaining effective organizations dedicated to sharing best practices would encourage knowledge sharing among the Army depots and improve the sharing of best practices. DOD is experiencing benefits and taking steps to mitigate challenges with implementing some of the best practices it has implemented among the 17 depot maintenance facilities, such as sharing technology to reduce costs and improving maintenance processes to repair parts and systems. For example, one depot implemented a best practice learned from another to improve its depot management process in meeting its production schedule, which is a plan that identifies, among other things, working hours for maintainers, available storage, and parts supply. In response to GAO's survey, 16 of the 17 DOD depots reported benefits from successfully implementing this best practice or lessons learned, including cost and time savings. DOD has not been able to implement some of these best practices but is taking actions to mitigate some challenges to implementation, including insufficient resources, restrictions related to information technology, approval process, and acquisition and contracting policies, among others.
In 2010, FCC issued the National Broadband Plan that included a centralized vision for achieving affordability and maximizing use of high-speed Internet. The plan made recommendations to FCC, including that FCC should take into account the unique spectrum needs of tribal communities when implementing spectrum policies and evaluate its policies and rules to address obstacles to spectrum access by tribal communities. GAO was asked to review tribal access to spectrum. In November 2018, GAO reported on (1) the extent to which tribal entities have obtained spectrum licenses to provide broadband services and barriers they face in doing so and (2) FCC's actions to increase tribal access. This testimony is based on GAO's November 2018 report (GAO-2019-10-854). GAO reviewed FCC's spectrum license data and interviewed officials from FCC, tribal entities, and other stakeholders to identify barriers tribal entities reported facing in obtaining spectrum licenses. For its November 2018 review of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) active spectrum licenses in bands that can be used for broadband services as of September 2018, we identified 18 tribal entities from FCC's license data that held licenses in these bands. We interviewed 16 tribal entities that were using wireless technologies at the time to provide service, and 14 told us that they were accessing unlicensed spectrum to do so. While representatives from most of the 16 tribal entity representatives reported some advantages of un licensed spectrum, such as the spectrum is available at no cost, they also discussed their experiences with the limitations of this spectrum, including issues with interference and speed or capacity. For example, representatives from some tribal entities told us they were unable to obtain financing to participate in auctions because tribal governments cannot use tribal lands as collateral to obtain loans and that participating in spectrum auctions requires auction-specific expertise that tribal entities may not have. Tribal entities also reported facing barriers obtaining spectrum through secondary market transactions. Most of the spectrum allocated for commercial use has already been assigned through spectrum auctions and other mechanisms to private providers that may not be providing service on tribal lands. As such, there may be tribal areas where providers hold licenses for bands but are not using the spectrum to provide Internet service. The secondary market is one of few ways for tribal entities to obtain spectrum licenses, but representatives from tribal entities we contacted told us it could be challenging to participate because there is a lack of willing sellers, license holders are not easily identified, and tribal entities might not be aware of how to pursue secondary market activities. FCC had taken some actions in 2011 to increase access, but does not collect or communicate key spectrum-related information to tribal entities. FCC issued a proposed rulemaking in May 2018 that sought comment on establishing a priority window for tribal nations located in rural areas to obtain a license in the Educational Broadband Service spectrum band (also known as the 2.5 GHz band). FCC adopted this order on July 10, 2019. FCC's 2018 strategic plan stated that it will implement ongoing initiatives that will assist in spectrum policy planning and decision making, promote a robust secondary market in spectrum, and improve communications services in all areas of the United States, including tribal areas. Additionally, federal internal control standards state that agencies should use quality information, including information that is complete, to inform the decision-making processes and communicate with external entities. However, FCC did not consistently collect data on whether spectrum license-holders or auction applicants are tribal entities and did not communicate important information to tribes that could benefit them in their efforts to obtain licenses in the secondary market. As a result, FCC's evaluations of the secondary markets may not accurately reflect how its policies affect tribal entities because they may not fully reflect how tribal entities access spectrum. By collecting data on the extent that tribes are obtaining and accessing spectrum, FCC could better understand tribal spectrum issues and use this information as it implements ongoing spectrum initiatives. Furthermore, the ability of tribal governments to make informed spectrum planning decisions is diminished without information from FCC on the spectrum transactions that occur over tribal lands, which could enable them to enter into leasing, partnership, or other arrangements. FCC agreed with our recommendations and described the actions it will take to implement them.
The Army is in the midst of a multiyear effort to modernize its forces to meet current and future requirements. In January 2019, GAO reported on the initial steps the Army has taken to consolidate all its modernization efforts under one authority by establishing Army Futures Command, which is led by a four-star general. GAO was asked to testify on its January 2019 report on the Army's modernization efforts. This testimony is based on that report and addresses (1) how the Army can improve the way the new command operates, (2) the extent to which the command has implemented leading practices for effective cross-functional teams, and (3) the steps the command can take to reduce risk to the long-term modernization of its capabilities. To conduct this work, GA O reviewed Army documentation, interviewed Army officials, and conducted fieldwork in Washington, D.C., and Austin, Texas. The Department of Defense's (DOD) Army can take steps to improve how its new Future Combat Systems Command (Army Futures command) operates by implementing leading practices GAO has previously identified as leading for mergers and organizational transformations, such as having a clear mission statement and leadership dedication to the command and a clear organizational structure. In July 2018, the Army declared the commencement of operations for the command, which was established to provide unity of command, accountability, and modernization at the speed and scale required to prevail in future conflicts. The command is expected to be fully operational by July 2019, meaning it will have sufficient staff with operational facilities, secure funding, and the ability to execute its assigned mission, roles, and responsibilities. The Army's new command is headquartered in Austin,Texas. According to Army officials and documentation, the command chose Austin because of its proximity to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics talent, as well as private sector innovators that Army officials believe will assist the command in achieving its modernization goals. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology is the civilian authority responsible for the overall supervision of Army acquisition matters and the acquisition offices it oversees. To mitigate concerns about coordination, in August 2018 the Army issued a directive designating the military deputy to the assistant secretary as an advisor to Army Future Command, and officials have stated that the civilian will retain full acquisition authorities as required by law. Army Futured Command expects to continue to refine its coordination with the Office ofthe Assistant Secretary. Since announcing the modernization efforts in 2017, theArmy has directed more funding toward closing near-term capability gaps, focused on fiscal years 2019 through 2023, and has begun to identify and begin to fund longer-term needs. For example, as part of the planning for the fiscal year 2019 budget process the Army identified 67 high-priority programs that require further investment, including the M-1 Abrams tank and the AH-64 Apache helicopter. To support these priorities, it identified a need for $16 billion in increased funding in fiscal years2019 through 2021. In addition to the near- term capabilities the Army is pursuing, it has identified a number of long- term needs—those focused after fiscal year 2024—and begun to align research and development efforts with these needs. The 2018 Army Modernization Strategy report identified the need for additional resources for near- Term efforts, including plans to spend billions of dollars for acquisition of maneuverable short-range air defense capabilities in fiscal year 2020 through 2024. To improve the efficiency of requirements development and the overall defense systems acquisition process, in January 2019 GAO recommended that the Army assess the resources, particularly personnel, necessary for requirements development. Army concurred with the recommendation and stated that it would implement this recommendation once the command is fully operational. As the command approaches full operating status, it is important to define not only how the command functions, but how it works with other Army organizations. To address this issue, the Command has established eight cross- functional teams, which are intended to take steps toward achieving the six modernization priorities, leverage expertise from industry and academia, identify ways to use experimentation, prototyping, and demonstrations, and identify opportunities to improve the efficient requirements development process. The goal of these teams is to ensure that each team has individuals who specialized in acquisition, requirements, science and technology, test and evaluation, resourcing, contracting, cost analysis, sustainment, and military operations. The documentation that established the cross- Functional Teams fully addressed four of the eight leading practices, and at least partially addressed another four
The Department of Defense (DOD) relies extensively on information technology (IT) to support its business operations. In fiscal year 2020, DOD plans to spend approximately $8.9 billion to develop, modernize, operate, and maintain its business systems. GAO designated DOD's business systems modernization efforts as high risk in 1995 and has continued to do so in the years since. In addition, since 2005, GAO has issued 12 reports that assessed DOD's actions to respond to business system investment management requirements contained in U.S. Code Title 10, Section 2222. The Senate Armed Services Committee Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's implementation of business system requirements. This report assesses the extent to which DOD has (1) implemented GAO's recommendations related to business systems management and (2) complied with the statutory requirements for managing defense business systems, as of November 2019. To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and prior GAO reports and interviewed cognizant DOD officials. DOD made progress in strengthening the management of its defense business system investments. Specifically, between June 2019 and November 2019, the department demonstrated that it had implemented four of the 12 GAO recommendations aimed at strengthening business system management. For example, DOD implemented a recommendation to improve the department's policy to require full consideration of sustainability and technological refreshment requirements for its defensebusiness systems investments. The department also took actions to implement a recommendation that helped the department comply with the code's requirement to establish guidance for effectively managing its defense Business Systems Modernization efforts. Further, DOD took actions in response to two other recommendations to ensure that business systems are reviewed and certified in accordance with the codes' requirements to ensure compliance with the business enterprise architecture and business process reengineering requirements. However, more remained to be done to implement eight other recommendations that could help strengthen DOD's management of the business systems that support its transformation efforts. DOD agreed with the status of seven of the eight open recommendations that GAO reported in September 2019. For instance, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) stated that it intends to finalize the first increment of version 3 of its DOD Information Enterprise Architecture (i.e., IT enterprise architecture) by the end of December 2019, and intends to integrate its business and IT architectures as a part of that effort. The CIO also plans to develop a Defense Business Operations Management Workforce Plan by December 31, 2019, which will include skills requirements for both permanent and temporary employees in support of the reform of defense business operations management.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for collecting taxes and collecting taxes on behalf of the U.S. government. As of September 30, 2018, IRS had about $2.3 trillion in taxes owed to the federal government, of which about $1.2 trillion was owed in taxes that taxpayers did not report or that IRS has not identified through its enforcement programs, often referred to as the tax gap. The tax gap is the difference between the amount of taxes owed by taxpayers but not reported by IRS and the amount owed by them. IRS's financial statements are prepared in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles. GAO's audit of IRS's fiscal year 2019 financial statements was performed under the Comptroller General's authority under the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1974, as amended (FMFIA). The purpose of this report is to (1) describe the scope of GAOs testing of compliance with selected provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and the results of that testing, and (2) provide information on the audit findings and recommendations related to internal control over financial reporting and compliance with other requirements of FMFIA. In preparing this report, GAO relied primarily on its audit reports for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, as well as its prior audits of IRSS financial statements and other related documents. For each fiscal year since GAO began auditing IRSin accordance with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996GAO has also audited IRS’s financial statements. For the fiscal years ended in September 2018 and September 2019, and for the fiscal year ended September 2019 and for fiscal year 2018 in fiscal year 2017 in fiscal years 2010 and 2008 in fiscal Year 2018, GA O audited the financial statements of the Internal Revenue Services (IRs). GAO has audited these financial statements for the purpose of forming an opinion on whether the statements are free from material misstatement and whether IRS has effective internal controls in place to prevent, detect, and correct such misstatements and ensure that financial reporting is consistent with accounting and other applicable laws and regulations. In addition to the audited financial statements, IRS also has other information included with these statements that is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the financial statement or the Return of Income Statement (RSI). For each of the last five fiscal years (FY) ended in FY 2018 and FY 2019, IRS has also included in its financial statements information on its net cost of operations, changes in net position, budgetary resources, and custodial activity for the year then ended, as required by federal accounting standards. For example, for FY 2017, IRS reported a net loss of $1 billion and for FY 2016, its net loss was $6.1 billion. For FY 2015, the net loss for IRS was $2 billion. In its audits of the FY 2015 and FY 2014 financial statements GAO found that IRS had effective internal control for financial reporting, in all material respects, over its financial reporting as of FY 2014 through FY 2014. However, in each of these years GAO also found deficiencies in internal controls related to financial reporting that GAO does not consider to be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. These deficiencies warrant IRS management's attention and, where appropriate, will report on them separately along with related recommendations for corrective actions. In the audit of FY 2018, for example, IRS did not implement automated financial controls of interfaces between key applications, ensure that authorized personnel reviewed key documents for external systems, enforce multifactor authentication, enforce adequate encryption to protect systems and data, or ensure that patches installed on systems were current to protect against known vulnerabilities. These control deficiencies increase the risk of unauthorized access to, modification of, or disclosure of sensitive financial and taxpayer data and disruption of critical operations and are therefore important enough to merit the attention of those charged with governance of IRS.
Critical infrastructures are vital to the United States' security, economic stability, and public health and safety, and are vulnerable to a wide range of cyber-based threats. GAO has designated critical cyber infrastructure as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997, and in 2015 expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. In 2014, NIST published the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, a voluntary framework of cybersecurity standards and procedures for industry to adopt. In May 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued Executive Order 13800 directing federal agency heads to use the framework to manage cybersecurity risks and to provide a risk management report to DHS and the Office of Management and Budget within 90 days of the date of the executive order. In February 2018, GAO reported that most of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors had taken action to facilitate adoption of the framework by entities within their sectors. However, none of the nine sector-specific agencies (SSAs) with lead roles in critical infrastructure protection, as well as the federal and nonfederal sector coordinating councils (SCCs) representing all 16 sectors established in federal policy, had developed methods to determine the level and type of framework adoption across their sectors, as GAO previously recommended. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan and the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government recommend that entities, such as SSAs and SCCs, take steps to evaluate progress toward achieving their goals—in this case, to implement or adopt the cybersecurity framework. As of November 2019, only two of nine SSAs—the Department of Defense (DOD) in collaboration with the defense industrial base sector and the General Services Administration (GSA) in conjunction with DHS's Federal Protective Service—had methods for determining the level or type of adoption by the entities across their respective sectors. The remaining five SSAs did not have efforts underway to determine framework adoption: Department of Agriculture (Agriculture), Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of the Treasury (Treasury). GAO was asked to review the extent to which (1) SSAs have determined framework adoption and (2) implementation has led to improvements to the protection of critical infrastructure from cyber threats. To address these objectives, we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from NIST, SCC, and selected organizations in six sectors identified in the 2018 National Cyber Strategy as having critical infrastructure with the greatest risk of being compromised. The six sectors were (1), communications, (2), financial services, (3) energy, (4) healthcare and public Health, (5) information technology, and (6) transportation systems. The selected organizations reported either fully or partially using the framework. Specifically, six of the 12 organizations reported fully using the Framework, whereas six others reported partially using it. The 12 organizations also reported varying levels of improvements. For example, four organizations reported great improvement, six organizations reported some improvement, and two organizations reported little improvement. Such improvements included identifying risks and implementing common standards and guidelines. The SSAs reported impediments to collecting and reporting sector-wide improvements, including the lack of precise measurements of improvement, voluntary nature of framework, and lack of a centralized information sharing mechanism. NIST and DHS have identified initiatives to help address these impediments, including an information security measurement program and a cybersecurity framework starter profile for small and mid-sized organizations. These initiatives are in the early stages of being implemented, but NIST has yet to establish time frames for completing them. Until they do so, the SSAs will not be in a position to collect and report on the extent of improvements made as a result of framework use.
Wildfires play an important ecological role on the nation's landscapes but various management practices over the past century—including fire suppression, timber harvesting, and grazing—have altered the normal frequency of fires in many forest and grassland ecosystems and have reduced these ecosystems' resilience to wildland fire. This history of fire exclusion and changes in forest management have resulted in a buildup of surface fuels—burnable material found on or near the ground—and the overstocking of some forests with trees and other fuels. In addition, the reduced frequency of wildfire in some ecosystems has resulted in increased amounts of vegetative debris (e.g., dead trees, branches, leaves, and grasses) accumulating on the ground, which serves to increase fuel quantities and can create more continuous fuels. When this occurs, surface fires—fires that occur on theground—may ignite more quickly and burn with greater intensity, causing fires to spread more rapidly and extensively than they may have in the past. In some cases, these fires can cause damage to communities and ecosystems. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to reduce wildfire risk on federal lands. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal agencies have implemented fuel reduction projects and (2) how federal agencies allocated funds for fuel reduction in fiscal year 2018 and the approaches they used to do so. To do this work, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from five federal agencies—the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Forest Service (BLM), and Interior (Interior)—that manage or administer lands in the contiguous United States. The five agencies have estimated that over 100 million acres of their lands are at high risk from wildfire. The Forest Service and Interior have implemented approximately 1.4 million and 1.1 million acres, respectively, of fuels reduction projects in fiscal years 2009 through 2018. These projects are intended to reduce the intensity of future wildfires to help protect communities, restore ecosystems, or both, according to agency documents. For example, BIA and the San Carlos Apache Tribe said that they perform prescribed burns and mechanical treatments annually on approximately 1,000 to 1,600 acres of theSan Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona to remove rapidly growing grasses, which could quickly carry a wildfire into the community. BIA officials said they perform these treatments close to the community, to help keep fires from reaching structures and to provide space for firefighters to work more safely in the event of a fire (see figure). The five other federal agencies GAO interviewed—BIA, BLM, FWS, NPS, Interior, and the Bureau of Reclamation—also conduct fuel reduction activities on lands they manage and administer. In fiscal year 2017, the five agencies allocated approximately $1.4 billion in fuel reduction funds to the Forest Service for projects to reduce fuels on national forests and grasslands. Officials from all five agencies said that the number of acres needing fuel reductions is significantly larger than the number the agencies are able to treat in any given year. Agency officials told GAO that in deciding how to allocate these funds, they considered similar types of information related to wildfire hazard potential, such as the proximity of communities and infrastructure to potential fires, ecosystem health, and location of natural resources, among other factors. As a result, each agency used a different approach for allocating funds for fiscal year2018. The four Interior agencies allocated fuel reduction funding to their regions based primarily on the allocation levels from the previous fiscal year. Forest Service officials allocated approximately 70 percent of the agency's total funds to its regions, withholding about 30 percent to make available to regions and national forests on a competitive basis later in the fiscal year for projects aligned with specific national priorities as determined by Forest Service headquarters. Interior's Office of Wildland Fire and BIA headquarters officials allocated funds to their regional offices based on an allocation model that the agency adopted around fiscal year 2012. Interior officials began testing an approach for reviewing each of the Interior agencies' planned projects for consistency with the Interior Secretary's fiscal year priorities in the third quarter of 2018.
Coastal communities face threats from erosion and damages from waves, wind, and storm surges that can cause loss of life, property damage, and damage to the environment. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) constructs projects to help reduce the risks from coastal storm hazards and mitigate erosion, wave damage and flooding, which may include the use of hard structures, such as seawalls and storm surge barriers. GAO was asked to review the Corps' use of natural infrastructure for coastal storm and flood risk management projects. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Corps has identified project costs and damage reduction benefits for selected projects that use natural infrastructure and (2) challenges the Corps faces in developing cost and benefit information for some types of natural coastal infrastructure and the steps it has taken to address them. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Corps guidance and eight selected projects with coastal storm risk management objectives on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts that the Corps constructed and that included natural infrastructure. The Department of Defense provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Based on GAO's review of the eight projects, the Corps typically identified costs and benefits in selecting the project alternative, although for some projects it also considered additional benefits such as recreational benefits. The Corps' Planning Guidance for Coastal Storm and Flood Risk Management projects states that it shall select projects determined to have the maximum net benefits--benefits minus costs--for each project alternative. For example, in selecting an alternative for a project in the Los Angeles District's Encinitas-Solana Beach project, the project team estimated the alternative's potential to reduce damages to existing structures, including homes and commercial buildings, by $1.5 billion. However, in the project's economic analysis, the team did not include recreational benefits, which stem directly from the alternative but are incidental to the primary purpose of damage reduction. When the Corps included recreational benefits in its economic analysis of the alternative that was selected, the combined annual damage reduction and recreational benefits resulted in the alternative having greater benefits than costs. The California Coastal Commission found that the proposed alternative was inconsistent with California's mission to protect and enhance the state's coastal environment. For the Philadelphia District's Lower Cape May project, ecosystem restoration was the primary objective, but it also included a beach component to protect a freshwater marsh from saltwater intrusion. The project team used a cost-effectiveness analysis to meet its primary objective by comparing environmental measures (e.g., the number of acres of habitat restored) with the costs of different alternatives. In addition, this project included a beaches component to help protect the marsh from storm intrusion. For its Jamaica Bay project, which was designed to address frequent flooding in Jamaica Bay, the New York District's Corps incorporated wetlands into the design at one location, along with hard infrastructure such as floodwalls. The nonfederal sponsors of the project told GAO that they advocated for the inclusion of these natural features, where appropriate, because of their risk reduction and ecological benefits. In response to the interests of nonf federal sponsors, the corps project team developed and recommended the alternative incorporating hard infrastructure and coastal wetlands, although the Corps did not directly include the economic benefits of these features in the economic analysis. The draft feasibility study noted that the project was economically justified based on the monetary benefits of the hard infrastructure alone and that the wetlands provided additional benefits that could not be monetized. For instance, wetlands may improve habitats for birds, which could enhance bird watching activities, and replenish beaches may provide more beach area for individuals to use for recreational activities and provide nesting habitat for birds and sea turtles, among other benefits. Based in part on a literature review, agency documentation, and interviews with Corps officials and other stakeholders GAO found that, based on literature review and interviews, the Army Corps faces challenges developing information on the performance of some natural infrastructure to help inform the process for selecting project alternatives and conducting economic analyses in feasibility studies. Specifically, these challenges related to assessing the performance and monetizing the social and environmental benefits associated with using natural infrastructure, and the Corps recognizes the need to obtain additional data to better develop cost andbenefit information for these features and has begun taking steps to do so. A Corps headquarters official stated that the agency has begun working on developing guidance and expects to issue the guidance in calendar year 2019.
Pregnancy-related deaths are among the leading causes of death among women in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). GAO was asked to review federal efforts to reduce these deaths. This report examines (1) the extent to which CDC collects maternal mortality data, (2) how CDC collects these data, and (3) how selected states use Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funds to implement efforts to address maternal mortality. GAO analyzed CDC data on pregnancy- related deaths from 2007 through 2016, the most recent data available, and interviewed officials from CDC, HHS, and five states selected based on geographic diversity and other factors, among other things. The five states were California, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Texas, and the District of Columbia, and GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. CDC has two national surveillance systems related to maternal mortality and has created a resource to facilitate state efforts. Federal law directs CDC's National Center for Health Statistics to collect statistics on maternal mortality, and in 2003, CDC revised the standard death certificate to include a checkbox to indicate whether a woman was pregnant at the time of her death or up to 1 year after delivery or end of pregnancy. The checkbox is part of the medical portion of the death certificate that is completed by a physician, coroner, or medical examiner. According to CDC officials, there has been staggered adoption of the revised death certificate by states, and not every state death certificate included the pregnancy checkbox until 2019. In addition, CDC has developed a data application that state or local medical review committees (MMRCs) can use to centrally collect information abstracted from various sources about each death. As of June 2019, CDC officials said that 25 states and one other jurisdiction were using this system. In 2017, CDC released MMRIA, in which MMRCs—multidisciplinary committees at the state and other jurisdictional level—can collect and review data from medical records, social service records, autopsy reports, and vital records to determine preventability, and identify factors that contributed to these deaths as well as prevention strategies to address these factors. Data from CDC's primary national surveillance system, the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS), show that from 2007 to 2016, over 6,700 women died of causes related to or aggravated by their pregnancy—either while pregnant or within 1 year of the end of a pregnancy. CDC's PMSS data show that the leading cause of pregnancy-related death was other cardiovascular conditions, followed by infection, hemorrhage, and cardiomyopathy, which comprised about 50 percent of all pregnancy related deaths. CDC data also show that most of the deaths occurred within 42 days of delivery or at the end or beginning of pregnancy, while specific causes varied depending on when the death occurred. For example, for non-Hispanic white and black women, the leading Cause of Death was hemorrhage; for Hispanic women, it was infection; and for Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native and Pacific Islander women, they were hemorrhage and infection, respectively. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has published guidance for managing pregnancy and heart disease that noted that complications are frequently encountered in the days, weeks, and months after delivery in women with known cardiovascular disease and in those with latent cardiovascular disease. Women with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease may be particularly at risk of manifesting symptoms for the first time during their postpartum course. HHS funds multiple ongoing efforts to improve maternal health, including the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) initiative and the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Services Block Grant Program. The AIM initiative, funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), engages provider organizations, state-based public health systems, consumer groups, and others in a national partnership to assist states in implementing evidence-based maternal safety bundles—sets of practices that when implemented collectively and reliably in the delivery setting may improve patient outcomes and reduce maternal mortality or severe maternal morbidity. In fiscal year 2018, 38 states and jurisdictions self-reported that the block grant partially or fully funded their MMRC, and additional states reported using block grant support for planning activities to begin development of theirMMRC.

FBOs are businesses granted the right by the airport to operate fueling facilities, hangars, aircraft tie-downs, aircraft rental, aircraft maintenance, flight instruction, and other aeronautical services at the airport. As of March 2019, there were 3,070 FBOs operating at 3,016 airports in the contiguous United States. GAO was asked to review issues related to FBO pricing. This report examines (1) the extent to which FBO prices are publicly available, (2) factors that may be associated with these prices, and (3) what is known about the extent of FBO competition. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data on aviation fuel prices at airports, interviewed stakeholders, and developed a statistical model to examine the correlation of selected factors with fuel prices. The Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not regulate fuel prices in the flight support (FBO) industry, but does require airports that receive federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants to ensure they provide fair and equal access to services and nondiscriminatory pricing. As a condition of accepting federal grants, airports have a responsibility to ensure that they and their contractors and concessionaires abide by the grant assurances, which include a prohibition of unjust economic discrimination. Based on GAO's review of airports' and third party websites, it found that fuel prices are readily available to anyone on the internet. However, fees for other services such as for parking and aircraft handling are less transparent. For example, such fees are not always available online, and fees may vary by type of aircraft, are sometimes waived, and are called by different terms. Stakeholders GAO interviewed—including officials from 26 airports, 16 FBO companies, and 18 general aviation pilots—highlighted key factors that are associated with FBO price. Consistent with general economic theory, these factors fall into three groups: costs, demand for an FBO's services, and competition among FBOS. For instance, according to stakeholders GAO spoke to, airport leases, infrastructure investment, fuel, labor, and security can affect FBO costs. For some FBO services, such as aircraft maintenance and flight training, a particular airport may require additional equipment or staff to provide these services. In addition, the location of an airport may influence the demand for these services, as airports located in areas with higher per-capita incomes may be more likely to have higher demand for such services. Competition may also influence prices, as FBO and airport managers and pilots told GAO that they view nearby airports as competitors and monitor the prices at these locations. As GAO has noted in the past, fuel prices may be correlated with a variety of cost, demand and competition factors that pertain to characteristics of airports and their locations, as well as characteristics of the FBO operating at airports. To more fully assess the issue, to control for other factors that also may be related to the price of aviation fuel, and to better understand the relationship between fuel prices and competition when controlling for other cost and demand factors such as airports' size and location, we developed a model to assess the correlation between selected factors and the price for full-service 100LL (100LL) and Jet A (Jet A) aviation fuel sold by fixed base operators (F BOs). GAO ran the model for all airports for which posted prices were available and for a subset of airports with an air traffic control tower (towered-airports). The model found a correlation between some of the competition factors described by stakeholders and the prices posted for 100LL and for Jet A. Specifically, the model found that the size of the airport—measured as the total number of operations—was associated with higher prices for both 100LL. The length of the longest runway available at an airport was also correlated with higher fuel prices, which is an indicator of the types of aircraft an airport can support. In particular, longer runways are able to accommodate larger and heavier aircraft—aircraft that generally use more fuel and thus may indicate higher demand. The availability of self-serve 100LL fuel was associated with lower prices for full service 100LL because pilots are presented with a lower price option, which may constrain the prices that FBO will charge for a full service option.
USDA administers the nation's school meals programs, which provide free and reduced-price meals to more than 9 million children each school day. In fiscal year 2018, the agency estimated that it spent about $12 billion on these programs, including about $6 billion for school meals. The school meals program is administered at the state level by a designated state agency that issues guidance to school districts providing the meals. School districts are responsible for certifying students as eligible for free or reduced price meals, providing children with nutritionally balanced meals, and counting and claiming eligible meals for federal reimbursement, among other things. USDA and state agencies also conduct oversight of the programs. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 requires agencies to identify, estimate, and report their improper payment amounts and to develop and implement improper payment reduction plans. GAO was asked to review issues related to improper payment error rates. This report examines (1) the extent to which USDA has taken steps to reduce improper payments in the school meal programs, and (2) the effect of these steps on reported error rates for fiscal year (FY) 2018. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed USDA officials. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has reported various actions aimed at lowering the school meals improper payments error rates in its agency financial reports. These actions—including onetime actions and longer-term efforts—cover multiple aspects of the schools meals programs. For example, USDA reported the creation of a new household application prototype intended to reduce applicant errors and the development of training for food service workers to address administrative errors. USDA also reported on mechanisms to collect information on program errors to support agency analysis and monitoring efforts. However, USDA changed what it considers to be an improper payment in FY 2018 reporting, resulting in reported FY 2018 error rates that are not comparable to those of prior years. Specifically, USDA determined that meal claiming errors do not meet the definition of an improper payments. As a result, this change contributed to a significant decrease in the estimated error rates reported for FY 2018. Although USDA considers certain program integrity risks through specific processes, it has not assessed fraud risks in the program. According to the Fraud Risk Framework, which GAO issued in July 2015, federal management should consider the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks. The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015, enacted in June 2016, requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish guidelines for federal agencies to create controls to identify and assess fraud risks and design and implement antifraud control activities. In July 2016, OMB published guidance about enterprise risk management and internal controls in federal executive departments and agencies. The fraud risk framework also identifies leading practices for conducting fraud risk assessments, such as tailoring the fraud risk assessment to the program and planning to conduct the assessment at regular intervals and when there are changes to program or operating environment. USDA officials stated that they have not established a process to plan or conduct a specific program integrity risk assessment for the school lunch programs. Instead, fraud risks are considered through the agency's efforts to assess overall program integrityrisk in the programs and through research, monitoring, and reporting activities designed to identify areas of program operations susceptible to improper payments and program error. These efforts include research projects and a consideration of specific risks when annually determining which states USDA will review through management evaluations. USDA's efforts do not align with the overarching concepts of planning and conducting fraud risks assessments in the Fraud risk framework. Without such an assessment, USDA cannot determine whether its key oversight processes—extensive efforts designed for broad monitoring purposes—address areas at risk for fraud.
The Bureau's address canvassing operation updates its address list and maps, which are the foundation of the decennial census. Precise maps are critical for counting the population in the proper locations--the basis of congressional apportionment and redistricting. GAO's prior work has shown that developing an accurate address list is challenging--in part because people can reside in unconventional dwellings, such as converted garages, basements, and other forms of “hidden” housing. For the 2010 Census, the Bureau mobilized almost 150,000 field workers to canvass almost every street in the United States and Puerto Rico to update the Bureau's map data--and in 2012 reported the cost at nearly $450 million. To reduce costs for the 2020 Census, in-field address canvasing was conducted in-office, where field staff compared what they saw on the ground to the addresses on their lists and maps. The Census Bureau (Bureau) estimated that 4.3 percent, or about 2.2 million addresses, failed to respond to the census in 2010. The Bureau's field staff, known as listers, were trained to speak with a knowledgeable resident at each housing unit to confirm or update address data, ask about additional units, confirm the housing unit location on the map (known as the map spot), and collect a map spot either using global positioning systems (GPS) or manually. If no one was available, listers were to use house numbers and street signs to verify the address data. The data were then transmitted electronically to the Bureau. In its observations of the operation, GAO found that listers did not always follow procedures. For example, 10 out of 59 listers GAO observed did not work ground to book (i.e., compare what the listers saw to what was on their list). The Bureau is taking steps to address this issue. In addition, 9 out of the 22 census field supervisors GAO spoke with did not consistently collect a GPS reading from the doorstep of every address as required, 14 of 59 did not knock on every door as required to confirm the address and ask about "hidden" housing units, and 17 did not look for or ask about hidden housing units. Not knocking on doors or asking about hidden units represents missed opportunities to potentially add missing addresses to the master address file. Further, not all listers provided the required confidentiality notices to occupants. Seven of the nine listers that did not provide confidentiality notices did not follow procedures, which may have resulted in some residents not being willing to provide their information if they knew their responses would not be shared. The Department of Commerce's (Commerce) Bureau of the U.S. Census has two studies underway that will evaluate the quality of the in- field address canvassers' work. In 2010, similar studies conducted by the Bureau in 2010 found that 95.7 percent of addresses were correctly deleted and 83.6 percent were correctly added. Both studies have a set of research questions designed to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of address canvassed. The final report for the first study will be available in September 2020. In commenting on a draft of this report, Commerce noted that GAO made no formal recommendations.
In September 2016, GAO reported that the Air Force had used the same underlying assumptions to establish its annual training requirements in the Ready Aircrew Program from 2012 through 2016, which may not reflect current and emerging training needs. GAO recommended that the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps comprehensively reassess the assumptions underlying these requirements and make any appropriate adjustments in future aircrew training plans to ensure that its forces can accomplish a full range of missions. In August 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) released a report on its management and operation of the program, which made nine recommendations to improve the program. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the report. This report assesses (1) the extent to which the RAND report addressed statutory requirements, followed generally accepted research standards, and identified deficiencies, and (2) the actions taken by DOD to address the recommendations. To address these objectives, we reviewed the report, interviewed DOD officials, and reviewed relevant documentation, including a draft of DOD's Joint Operational Infrastructure Plan. On the basis of GAO's analysis, we found that the RAND study on the Ready Aircrew Training Program addressed each of the three statutory elements required by Congress in Section 351. First, the report addressed two statutory elements by reviewing and assessing assumptions underlying annual continuation training requirements and the overall effectiveness of the training program in managing training requirements. These two elements focus on issues raised in prior GAO recommendations, which GAO discusses in more detail later in this report. Second, RAND followed generally Accepted Research Standards for design, execution, and presentation of results. These standards are consistent with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and DOD guidance on ensuring and maximizing the quality of information disseminated by federal agencies to the public. Third, RAND made three recommendations for the improved management of training requirements, which were based on its review and assessment of training assumptions and recommendations made in a September 2016 report GAO issued in September 2016. DOD concurred with all three of these recommendations. The Air Force did not concur with all of the recommendations, partially concurring with five of them, and did not agree with one. However, it did agree with the recommendation to invest in data systems for the collection, access, and storage of data to correct deficiencies in current systems and improve analysis and readiness reporting. In response to Section 351 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2017, the Air Air Force reported on August 30, 2018, that it is addressing the RAND recommendations by working to link readiness to training requirements by building training matrices to help commanders assess their units' progress in establishing common data architecture and evaluating aspects of the ready aircrew program to increase lethality and improve readiness as the Air force shifts to executing the mandates of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. In October 2019, upon completion of our audit work, officials provided GAO with a briefing they described as a corrective action plan that further elaborated on their position with respect to each of RAND's nine recommendations. Air Force officials conceded that the actions described in that briefing and plan were already underway at the time of the study and were not initiated in response to the study's recommendations. They stated that, though they generally agreed with the recommendations they lacked the manpower, resources, and means to implement them. As such, they considered each recommendation closed and have no plans for future follow-up on implementation of those recommendations.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the nation's largest flood insurance program, insuring more than 6 million properties at a cost of about $50 billion per year. NFIP has been on GAO's high-risk list since 2006, in part because of its fiscal exposure to the federal government. In fiscal year 2017, NFIP's debt to the U.S. Treasury increased to $20.5 billion, and it reached its borrowing limit of $30.4 billion in September 2017. GAO was asked to review NFIP. This report examines (1) funding programs available for property acquisitions, (2) FEMA's flood mitigation efforts, and (3) factors contributing to NFIPs fiscal exposure. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed NFIP data, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed FEMA officials. FEMA provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. FEMA funds property acquisitions through three grant programs that have varying characteristics and funding levels. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM), and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) programs provide grants to states, territories, and federally recognized tribal governments to mitigate the risk of flood damage to properties. The largest of the three programs, HMGP is based on the amount of disaster assistance a state or territory receives following a presidential disaster declaration, while PDM and FMA are smaller programs that receive annual appropriations and are not directly tied to an immediately preceding disaster. HMGP grants fund a variety of methods to mitigate flood risk, including acquisition, elevation, relocation, and floodproofing. In most cases, HMA grants cover up to 75 percent of the project cost, and the grantee generally must contribute the remainder using nonfederal funds (although there are some exceptions, such as for communities that meet FEMA's definition of small and impoverished). For example, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides up to 90 percent of project costs for projects that mitigate low-income properties and up to 100 percent for properties with severe flood damage. FEMA has mitigated more than 57,000 properties for flood risk from 1989 to 2018, including more than 46,000 through acquisition, but the number of nonmitigated repetitive loss (RL) properties increased from 2009 to 2018. The number of RL properties increased by 44,618 between 1989 and 2018, while FEMA mitigated 4,436 RL properties through its three HMA programs and an additional 15,047 through other federal or state programs. While FEMA does not require a property to be an RL property to receive flood mitigation funding, states varied in the extent to which they mitigated RL properties relative to their population of other properties. Some states with large numbers of repetitive loss properties (such as Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and New York) mitigated few RL properties, while other states have far fewer RL properties but have more properties mitigated relative to the numbers of other RL properties. While property acquisition accounted for 81 percent of mitigated properties nationwide, it represented closer to half of acquired properties in Virginia, New Jersey, and Florida and only 19 percent in Louisiana. According to some FEMA and local officials, high property values in some regions can make acquisitions cost prohibitive and other mitigation methods such as elevation more attractive because they do not incur the cost of purchasing the land. Many other factors could affect mitigation, including homeowners' preferences. Further, the voluntary nature of FEMA's programs may limit states' ability to acquire properties with known flood risk. While acquisition permanently addresses flood risk because it moves individuals and structures away from flood risk rather than mitigating a structure in place, it does not address the long-term fiscal exposure of NFIP because its premium rates have not kept pace with the flood risk of the properties it insures. As GAO has reported since 1983, premium rates do not reflect the full risk of loss because of various legislative requirements and FEMA practices. As a result, premium revenue has been insufficient to pay claims in some years, requiring borrowing from Treasury to make up for the shortfall. While Congress passed reforms in 1994 and 2004, neither set of actions sufficiently addressed program revenue. In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma hit the Gulf Coast and resulted in NFIP borrowing nearly $17 billion from Treasury for claims. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused $8.8 billion in claims,
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is the federal agency with primary responsibility for research and education in science and engineering at McMurdo Station in Antarctica. NSF also supports research at other facilities, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Energy's National Ignition Facility. In recent years, NSF has awarded about $1.6 billion for major facilities projects, which include the construction of new facilities and upgrades to existing facilities. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act requires that NSF ensure that its policies for estimating and managing costs and schedules are consistent with the best practices in GAO's cost guide, and NSF requires the same of its recipients. GAO was asked to review NSF's management of major facilities. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which NSF (1) has implemented recommendations GAO made in June 2018 and March 2019 and (2) has taken initial steps to address recommendations from those reports. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed NSF officials and external experts. In its comments on a draft of this report NSF stated that the report provides the agency with an independent assessment of its oversight of projects in design and construction and its stewardship of the MREFC account. The Department of Science and Technology's National Science Board, a policy and advisory body that is part of NSF and consists of the NSF Director and 24 members, drawn from industry and universities, provides high-level, ongoing oversight of the agency's major facilities, including the approval of new projects to be included in the annual NSF budget request. In addition, the agency uses external panels of experts to review projects at several points during their life cycles, including during both construction and operations. In June and March 2018 and again in March 2019, both GAO reported that the National Science Fund (NSf) had not fully implemented two of six recommendations made in response to a June 2018 GAO report on major facilities—recommendations on revising the Rubin Observatory's schedule to better meet best practices and revising its cost estimating policies to better incorporate best practices. In response to these two recommendations, in September 2019 NSF awarded a contract for a workforce gap analysis to assess the core competencies and necessary proficiency levels of agency staff overseeing the major facilities portfolio and promote long-term workforce development. As of September 2019, the contractor had not yet begun work on the analysis, but plans to complete it by the end of fiscal year 2020, according to NSF. In March 2019 GAO also reported on the project management competencies of NSf's oversight workforce and project management expertise of award recipients for major facility projects and recommended that the agency assess its oversight workforce to identify any competency gaps, develop a plan to address any gaps and monitor progress in closing them, and develop standards of performance for the oversight workforce. As a result of these and other recommendations, as of November 2019, NSf had drafted new language for the Major Facilities Guide and related supplemental award terms and conditions for major projects that would require award recipients to document how project management Competencies will be met. The agency plans to publish the new terms in June 2020. In December 2018, NS F solicited proposals for mid-scale research infrastructure projects and expects to award its first portfolio in August 2020. To provide guidance on oversight of mid- scale projects, NSO has included a chapter in its September 2019 update of its Major Facilities guide to outline minimum recipient requirements and its oversight activities for these projects. In January 2020, NSN plans to update its personnel management plan for NSF that outlines procedures for reviewing proposals, selecting projects, and managing the award process. According to agency officials, they plan to continue to update the plan in November 2019.
Since 2011, GAO has reported on a number of issues related to DOT's management of its discretionary grant programs, including a lack of documentation of key award decisions, inconsistent application reviews, and inconsistent application evaluation and selection of projects. In response to a mandate in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act of 2015, DOT established the INFRA program, which provides grants to state, local, and tribal governments, as well as multistate or multijurisdictional groups, for freight and highway projects that meet certain statutory requirements, such as demonstrating cost-effectiveness, among others. In July 2017, DOT announced that it had awarded $1.54 billion in INFRA funding for 26 projects. DOT also awarded $2.3 billion in discretionary grants through the FASTLANE program in 2015 and $1 billion through the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program in 2014. GAO was asked to review DOT's process for awarding INFRA grants. This report examines (1) the process DOT used to evaluate applications submitted in response to the July 2017 NOFO, (2) the extent to which DOT followed up with applicants to determine whether they met the statutory requirements for receiving awards, and (3) the rationale for the selection of selected projects for awards. To conduct this work,GAO reviewed DOT documents, interviewed DOT officials, and interviewed selected applicants and consultants. The Department of Transportation (DOT) evaluated proposed projects for the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) program using a multiphase review process involving technical and senior management teams. The process had three phases—application intake, technical evaluation, and senior review—each supported by different teams. DOT received 258 applications for projects in November 2017 and determined that 24 projects did not qualify for INFRA. The remaining 234 projects then moved to the Operating Administrations' screen, where staff from the appropriate modal agency provided input on: 1. the applicant's history with delivering projects on time; 2. whether the applicant had previously received federal funding from 3. whether they contacted the agency about their INFRA project, the nature of the contact, and the level of technical and financial assistance provided by the agency; 4. whether their project is on the Transportation Improvement Program or the Statewide Transportation Improvement program; and, 5. any specific issues with the project that evaluators should be aware of. DOT took steps to improve its process for evaluating INFRA applications and better communicate with unsuccessful applicants. For example, DOT formally notified unsuccessful applicants of selection decisions via email, addressing a concern GAO raised regarding the selection process for the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) Hurricane Sandy transit-resilience grant program. However, DOT did not provide a brief explanation of its decision to provide the Secretary of Transportation with a list of the projects it considered to be most likely to achieve the program's intended purpose. DOT's guidance states that grant recipients should be selected based on technical merit and those projects that are "most likely to achieved the intended purpose." GAO's review of DOT's application review process found that the process lacked consistency and transparency. Specifically, DOT provided inconsistent and unclear messages regarding how merit criteria would be used to select awardees, a large number of applications forwarded for potential award regardless of merit scoring, and limited documentation regarding why 26 projects were ultimately selected out of 165 for award. In addition, DOT's review process lacked transparency in that it did not document the reasons for some of the decisions made, including the reasons why certain applicants were selected for follow-up or why certain projects were not selected for award (for example, because they did not meet certain criteria). GAO recommended in 2016 that DOT develop a department-wide directive to address these issues. DOT concurred with the recommendation and initially stated that it would address it by updating its Financial Assistance Guidance Manual by September 2018 (Dot recently extended this to December 2019). However, it is unclear how this action will address the recommendation because DOT has not always followed its own guidance, and it remains unclear whether updating the manual would have the same effect as issuing the departmentwide directive.
Business identity theft refund fraud (business IDT) refers to the fraudulent use of both business and employment tax forms. Both of these types of forms require an Employer Identification Number (EIN) when filing with IRS, and a fraudster can file these forms to obtain a refund. GAO was asked to review IRS's efforts to detect and prevent business IDT refund fraud. This report (1) describes these efforts, (2) evaluates the extent to which these efforts are consistent with selected fraud risk management leading practices, and (3) assesses IRS efforts to resolve cases. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed IRS documents and data, and interviewed IRS officials. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made progress in detecting and preventing business identity theft (Business IDT). For example, in 2018, IRS stopped about 188,500 incoming business tax returns claiming $47.6 billion in refunds and determined that about 77 percent of these were not fraudulent. However, these estimates do not capture the full size and scope of the problem because IRS does not collect data on all business tax forms that may be susceptible to IDT. Further, IRS has not developed fraud filters for at least 25 additional business-related tax forms, representing about $10.4 billion in 2018 refunds. As a result, IRS is not able to analyze data from these forms for emerging fraud patterns or schemes. Without additional data, IRS cannot estimate the full scope and size of this problem. IRS has taken some steps to identify and prevent IDT fraud, but its efforts are not fully aligned with selected Fraud Risk Management leading practices. IRS leadership has demonstrated a commitment to identifying and combating overall business refund fraud and has implemented agency-wide antifraud efforts, such as bringing officials together from across the organization to discuss potential fraud risks. These efforts have helped to foster an "antifraud tone" across IRS, according to IRS officials, which is consistent with GAO's Fraud Risk Framework, which calls for agencies to create an organizational culture conducive to combating fraud. At the business unit level, four IRS entities have responsibility for detecting, preventing, and resolving businessIDT, but none of the entities has defined responsibilities and the necessary authority to manage fraud risk across the business units. IRS officials stated that the IDT Executive Steering Committee—which last met in October 2018—is responsible for providing general oversight and guidance to business units working on IDT-related efforts, but the committee has not specifically discussed IDT program priorities, potential fraud risk, or resources. The absence of an entity to lead these fraud risk efforts may contribute to the issues GAO identifies later in this report related to the identification and assessment of business ID tat fraud risks consistent with leading practices and delays in resolving business IDt cases. The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 (FRDAA) requires federal agencies to establish financial and administrative controls for managing fraud risks, which are aligned with leading fraud risk practices outlined in the fraud risk framework. IRS's Office of Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics (RAAS) is responsible for supporting Return Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS) and other business units in identifying and developing various business IDsT fraud detection capabilities. RAAS also performs analyses to help IRS determine how best to proceed with other fraud detection and prevention efforts. However GAO found that RAAS and RICS have been delayed in resolving cases due to various challenges, including the complexity of the business tax environment and the need to research associated businesses, employment, and individual tax returns. For instance, IRS's correspondence-based authentication, which relies on taxpayers to verify their identity using a government-issued form of identification, is inherently less secure because it may not require the taxpayer to verify the return in question is legitimate. GAOs' review of past GAO, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and National Taxpayer Advocate reports identified issues that pose inherent risks to IRS's IDT efforts, including weaknesses with correspondence- based authentication, EIN vulnerabilities, and the high false detection rates for IDT Fraud Filters. IRS management's overall response to these issues has been limited. Identifying and implementing ways to address these challenges could help IRS better serve taxpayers and minimize additional costs to the Department of the Treasury.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for securing the nation's surface transportation systems, including mass transit systems. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to secure these systems. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which TSA has developed technologies to address surface transportation security gaps and (2) how DHS, S&T, and mass transit stakeholders collaborate to identify and test technology solutions to address these gaps. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from DHS, TSA, and nine mass transit operators selected based on size and complexity of their systems and other factors, among others. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provided insights on TSA's technology testing efforts. The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Transportation Security Agency (T TSA) has developed a surface transportation technology research and development (R&D) program to address the threat of improvised explosive devices (IED) on persons or in objects within a mass transit station. The Surface Transportation Explosive Threat Detection (STETD) Program is the only DHS R&D program focused solely on mass transit security. The STETD program consists of four technologies, each of which is in a different stage of development and maturation. These technologies are designed to address unique aspects of the mass transit environment (i.e., multiple access points, lack of access barriers, etc.) while also working together to provide IED detection coverage from the point at which the passenger enters a mass Transit Station, boards a train, and then finally exits the system. The program's completion date has been extended from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2023 due to fluctuations in funding, according to TSA officials. S &T officials stated that, as of fiscal year 2019, the program remains the agency's sole R&T program related to surface transportation. However, the agency has not followed DHS guidance for developing milestones that would help officials understand whether the program is achieving key activities identified in planning documents when faced with funding and other challenges. Without milestones that clearly convey an understanding of the program's progress, DHS decision makers are not positioned to identify any adjustments that may be needed to facilitate the achievement of program goals. Mass transit stakeholders regularly collaborate on issues related to identifying mass transit capability gaps and testing security technologies, but TSA does not comprehensively share technology assessment information with these stakeholders. For example, in March 2019 GAO reported that DHS-wide R&R collaboration has improved through the Intermodal Transportation Systems Research and Development (IPT) process, but some challenges remain, such as ensuring all components participate in the process. In addition, while TSA publishes technology assessment and other information on commercially available technologies, it does not routinely share this information with transit operators. In the past, TSA has shared information related to technology assessments routinely with transit stakeholders, but officials from seven of the nine transit operators GAO spoke with said they wanted more technical assessment information, indicating that they may not be routinely requesting, and therefore not receiving, the TSA products that would provide this information. Without a mechanism to share technology assessments and related information with more transit operators and on a routine basis, TSA cannot ensure that transit operators are fully informed about available technologies they could use to secure their systems. Moreover, without this information, transit operators may be unable to make the best possible use of the limited funding available for purchasing these technologies.
DHS has faced long-standing challenges in acquiring and managing information technology (IT) and plans to spend approximately $2.3 billion on major IT investments in fiscal year 2020. To address these challenges, in April 2016, DHS issued an Agile instruction, which identified Agile software development as the preferred approach for all DHS programs and projects that are to deliver an IT, or embedded-IT, capability. The department also set an expectation for its CIO to develop plans to increase the use of Agile development and to justify any major IT programs that did not intend to use it. GAO was asked to review DHS's transition to Agile. This report assesses the extent to which DHS (1) addressed selected leading practices for its transition and (2) adhered to leading practices in two specific areas: organizational change management and software development adoption. To do this, GAO reviewed DHS policies, guidance, plans, and other artifacts and compared them against leading practices and interviewed DHS officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made progress in implementing leading practices, but has not fully addressed others. Leading practices for adopting Agile methods for software development advise an agency to focus on three organizational levels of adoption: agency environment, program processes, and team activities and dynamics. DHS has partially adopted practices at all three of these organizational levels. For example, the agency environment practice level has been fully implemented by DHS by fully implementing two practices and partially implementing the remaining one. Agency activities support Agile methodologies—fully implemented. DHS established appropriate life cycle activities to support these methods, such as developing policies and procedures that called for the alignment of software, program goals, and agency goals. However, DHS did not demonstrate that it established an incentives and rewards structure to incentivize Agile teams, as called for by leading practices. Agency culture—partially implemented. The agency environment has established an environment that supported Agile Methodologies, and senior stakeholders supported its development throughout the agency. DHS officials stated that senior stakeholders serving as executive sponsors were considered to be chief executive officers and approved the Agile action plans in June 2017. In addition, the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer said that there were no Agile training requirements for officials at this level. By training executive-level sponsors, the department can mitigate the risk of setting expectations for programs that do not align with the values and principles of Agley software development. Program-level practices support team activity and dynamics—partly implemented. These practices include prioritizing work to maximize value for the customer and establishing repeatable processes to ensure the quality of code being developed. DHS's efforts to track and monitor the pace of team development have been partially implemented. According to DHS officials, programs were not consistently reporting the core metrics associated with development team pace as required. The Director of Strategic Technology Management stated that the department was in the process of updating these core metrics and intended to publish a new version of them in the future, which would include tracking the pace, but did not provide assurance that the metrics would be included in this revised set of metrics or that programs would consistently report that information. Until the department consistently tracks and monitors Agile projects, it will not have the information needed to help ensure the development pace is maintained. With respect to team-level practice, DHS has not established guidance for estimating the relative complexity of user stories. As a result, teams are hampered in effectively committing to an appropriate amount of work during a given period of time. Finally, DHS had not set expectations for performance metrics for monitoring and tracking automated testing and code quality. By setting these expectations and beginning to monitor project performance against these expectations, DHS can increase the likelihood that Agile programs are delivered within expectations.
The TSA Modernization Act includes a provision for GAO to review the effectiveness of the TSA process to update, consolidate, or revoke security directives, emergency amendments, and other policies related to international aviation security at last point of departure airports. This statement summarizes the findings of GAO's draft report on (1) TSA's efforts to improve aviation security and (2) actions needed to reflect pipeline security roles in key documents and to address weaknesses in TSA's pipeline security program management. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has taken steps to strengthen aviation security, but additional actions are needed. Civil aviation, including U.S.-bound flights, remains a target of coordinated terrorist activity. GAO has issued reports on TSA's foreign airport and air carrier inspection programs (December 2017 and July 2018), assessments of Cuban aviation security (July 2018), and TSA's process for reviewing security directives and emergency amendments that apply at last points of departure (October 2019). For example, in December 2017 GAO found that TSA had implemented targeted foreign airport assessments in locations where risk was high and developed a system to strengthen its data analysis capabilities. In July 2018 GAO reported that TSA's inspections and assessments in Cuba generally followed standard operating procedures, but TSA did not inspect all air carriers at its own established frequency and recommended that TSA improve its ability to identify certain air carriers requiring inspection in Cuba and develop and implement a tool that more reliably tracks their operations between the United States and Cuba. In response, TSA developed several tools and processes that corroborate and validate flight schedule data and began issuing monthly reports on unscheduled operations to its inspectors responsible for Cuba. TSA is currently reviewing the draft report and is scheduled to provide any comments by early November 2019. TSA deploys technologies to screen passengers and their carry-on and checked baggage for homemade explosives and other prohibited items that could, among other things, cause catastrophic damage to an aircraft. The ongoing threat of terrorism requires TSA to continually assess its screening operations and, when necessary, develop and deploy new screening technologies. TSA considers risk at the beginning of the screening technologies acquisition process, but does not fully disclose what risk factors are weighed and how decisions are made to deploy screening technologies are made. TSA also does not ensure that screening technologies continue to meet detection requirements after they have been deployed to airports, when performance can degrade over time. Developing and implementing a process to ensure technologies continued to meet requirements after deployment would help ensure that TSA screening procedures are effective and enable TSA to take corrective action if needed. TSA's Pipeline Security Program Management More than 2.7 million miles of pipelines transport and distribute the natural gas, oil and other hazardous liquids that the people and businesses within the United states depend on to operate vehicles and machinery, heat homes, generate electricity, and manufacture products. TSA oversees the security of all transportation modes, including pipelines, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), within the Department of Transportation (DOT), oversees pipeline safety. TSA has developed and provided pipeline operators with voluntary security guidelines, and evaluates the vulnerability of pipeline systems through security assessments. In December 2018, however, we identified some weaknesses and made recommendations to strengthen TSA's management of key aspects of its Pipeline Security program. For example: TSA does not have a strategic workforce plan to help ensure it identifies the skills and competencies—such as the required level of cybersecurity expertise—needed to carry out its pipeline security responsibilities. We have ongoing work examining the actions TSA, airport operators, and air carriers have taken to mitigate concerns regarding insider threats at airports and the extent to which TSA's Insider Threat Program is guided by a strategic plan. We will continue to monitor TSA's progress in addressing our recommendations.
The FHLBanks are federally chartered banks that issue debt to provide loans to their member institutions. In 2010, FHFA issued the Minority and Women Inclusion rule to set forth minimum requirements for FHLBank diversity programs and reporting. The rule requires each bank to create its own OMWI or designate an office to perform duties related to the bank's diversity efforts, and establish policies related to diversity and inclusion, including workforce and business activities (which can include suppliers and broker-dealers used for capital markets activities). GAO was asked to review FHL bank diversity. This report examines, among other things, (1) the share of women and minorities in senior management across the 11 FHL Banks in 2011–2017 and (2) the extent to which the 11 banks have implemented practices to help maintain and increase the diversity of their workforce. GAO analyzed data from the Office of the Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHFA) Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on women and minority representation in senior-management positions at the 11 Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBank) banks from 2011 to 2017 and interviewed staff from all 11 banks and FH FA staff. The share of female and minority employees in the FHL Bank workforce overall was similar in 2011 and 2017 (about 61 percent and 71 percent, respectively). Women were less represented than in the financial services industry (overall and by bank) and in college-educated populations in selected metropolitan areas in 2017, but minorities were similarly represented across the categories. Individual banks reported a number of challenges in recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce, including limited hiring opportunities due to low employee turnover and a small workforce and competition for diverse talent from larger and better-known companies. Despite these challenges, banks have been taking steps to help increase workforce diversity. All 11 banks reported several targeted diversity recruitment efforts to increase recognition and build a potential pipeline of diverse employees. For example, all banks conducted outreach to colleges that have diverse student populations, and all banks offered a college internship program for which they try to recruit diverse candidates. The banks also engaged in efforts to build the potential pipeline in the long term, such as by participating in programs or activities to increase skillsets among young women or minorities in technical or financial services fields. The 11 banks' use of minority- and women-owned suppliers in 2018 varied among the banks, and the banks generally implemented key practices that can help ensure they consider diverse suppliers in their searches for business partners. For instance, in 2018, the banks' total supplier expenditure was about $453 million, of which about 8 percent and 13 percent went to minority-and women- owned suppliers, respectively. In 2018, FHLbank staff reported some challenges that may slow or limit their use of diverse suppliers, including small and small-scale business needs, limited capital, and limited services and products offered by diverse broker- Dealers. FHL banks also generally implemented the four key practices GAO previously identified for increasing opportunities for minority-owned asset managers, which can be applied to diverse suppliers and brokers and used to help ensure organizations consider qualified businesses in their selection process.
The federal government faces fiscal exposure from climate change risks in a number of areas, and this exposure will likely increase over time, as GAO concluded in a September 2017 report. GAO was asked to testify on the federal government's fiscal exposure to climate change and its efforts to reduce this exposure. This testimony is based on prior GAO work issued from October 2009 through September 2017, including GAO's March 2019 High-Risk Report on federal fiscal exposure and selected updates conducted in March 2019 on federal efforts to address climate change. For the selected updates, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, guidance, and other documents and interviewed federal officials and climate change experts. The federal government could reduce its fiscal exposure by focusing and coordinating federal efforts. However, it is currently not well organized to address the fiscal exposure presented by climate change, partly because of the inherently complicated and crosscutting nature of the issue. As of December 2018, 25 of the 62 recommendations GAO has made related to reducing the government's climate-related fiscal exposure remained open. In describing what needs to be done to reduce fiscal exposure, our March 2019 high-risk report discusses many of the open recommendations. Implementing these recommendations could help reduce federal fiscal Exposure. For example, in September 2017 GAO recommended that the Executive Office of the President (EOP) use economic information to identify and respond to significant climate risks. Such information could help federal decision makers identify significant climate priorities as an initial step toward managing climate risks, consistent with leading practices for climate risk management and federal standards for internal control. The executive branch faces fiscal Exposure from Climate Change Risks, but Past GAO Work Shows an Absence of Government-wide Strategic Planning GAO reported in October 2019 that there is an absence of government-wide strategic planning for climate change that could help the federal federal government better manage climate risks and direct federal efforts toward common goals, such as improving resilience. Specifically, the government does not have a strategic approach for investing in climate resilience projects—that is, an intentional, crosscutting approach in which the government identifies and prioritizes projects for the purpose of enhancing climate resilience. Federal agencies may take actions to invest in projects with potential climate resilience benefits related to their own mission areas using funds from federal programs designed for other purposes. In addition, the National Climate Assessment provides high-level information on what is known about observed and projected climate risks in the United States, but no federal entity looks holistically at federal investments to strategically prioritize projects to ensure that they address the nation's most significant climate risk and provide the highest net benefits relative to other potential projects. Further, the U.S. government has not undertaken strategic planning to manage significant climate challenges before they become fiscal exposures. As a result, federal agencies do not know the full extent of their fiscal exposure or have a shared understanding of the potential costs of climate change to society and the federal budget. In October 2019 GAO also issued the Disaster Resilience Framework to serve as a guide for analysis of federal action to facilitate and promote resilience to natural disasters. The framework identifies three key principles that can help federal effort to promote disaster resilience, including building resilience toclimate change. First, authoritative and understandable information can help decision-makers identify current and future risks and the impact of risk-reduction strategies. Second, integrated analysis and strategic planning can help decide makers take coherent and coordinated resilience actions. Third, financial and nonfinancial incentives can help make long-term, forward-looking risk reduction investments more viable and attractive among competing priorities.
Traffic fatalities and serious injuries on the nation's highways are among the leading causes of death and injury in the United States. NHTSA and FHWA, within DOT, provide grant funding to states to mitigate the behavioral and infrastructure-related causes of vehicular crashes. GAO was asked to review states' use of federal funds to improve traffic safety. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have achieved fatality and serious injury targets set under the framework, (2) how states use performance measures and targets in the framework to make traffic safety funding decisions, and (3) how the framework has changed states' approaches to selecting highway safety projects. To address these objectives, GAO surveyed 52 state departments of transportation about the framework and received responses from 50 of the 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, for a 100 percent response rate. To obtain information on states' progress in meeting fatality targets and achieving serious injury-related targets, we analyzed state-reported data from 2014 through 2017, the most recent data available at the time of our review. The Department of Transportation's (DOT) National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) have made great strides over the last decade in moving to a performance-based approach for highway safety funding to improve accountability for federal funds. However, the results, however, are not always clear. From 2014 to 2017, states did not achieve about two-thirds of the targets they set for the required fatality performance measures, according to GAO's analysis of state reported data. In addition, for the majority of the fatality measures, these data show that the number of targets states achieved generally decreased. For example, in 2017, 10 of 52 states achieved their target for the pedestrian fatalities performance measure, but 5 of these 10 states also experienced an increase in pedestrian fatalities compared to their 2012 through 2016 historical average. These data also show that 42 states did Not achieve their total fatality target. N HTSA officials said that achieving targets often depends on factors outside of a state's control, such as demographic and economic factors, as well as changes to state laws. For instance, officials from 8 of the 10 selected states said that demographic factors such as increases or decreases in population can affect traffic safety, and 7 of these states noted that low unemployment can affect whether a state meets traffic safety targets. Officials from the Association of Transportation Safety Information Professionals said that states may recalculate targets to account for changes in the data over the transition to the new national standard for serious injuries, but that states have not expressed concerns about doing so. States have not fully incorporated performance measures or targets into traffic safety project selection decisions, but NHT SA and FhWA are taking steps to assist states. Over half of the states GAO interviewed reported that the performance measures influenced their decisions about which projects they selected to fund, and officials from about a third of states said the targets did not influence their project selection. Officials cited a variety of reasons for why they did not use this performance information to select projects, including that their states already had a data-driven approach to project selection and that they receive limited safety funding and therefore select projects to make sure they are eligible to qualify for safety grants. Officials also reported other safety benefits from the performance framework in addition to improved project selection, including increased collaboration with other highway safety stakeholders in the state. NhtSA officials acknowledged that the framework can pose challenges for some states but noted that they provide technical assistance and guidance to help states make the best use of their performance information.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) relies extensively on information technology (IT) to carry out its mission of providing health care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials to veterans and their families. VA's health care system—VistA—serves an essential role in helping the department to fulfill its health care delivery mission. Since 2001, VA has pursued four efforts to modernize VistA. In June 2017, VA announced that it planned to acquire the same electronic health record system that the Department of Defense (DOD) has acquired. In May 2018, VA awarded a contract to Cerner to acquire this system for a maximum of $10 billion over 10 years. GAO was asked to testify on VA's efforts to implement key provisions of the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act of 2014 (FITARA). In this testimony, GAO describes VA's progress toward implementing key FITARA provisions related to (1) IT management, (2) cybersecurity, and (3) CIO authority enhancement. This testimony is based on prior GAO reports issued from November 2017 through March 2019, selected updates conducted in March 2019 to obtain information on the status of VA's IT modernization efforts. To conduct these updates, VA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. VA has made limited progress toward addressing the IT management challenges for three critical initiatives. Specifically, the department has recently initiated its fourth effort to Modernize VISTA, but uncertainty remains regarding the program's governance. In addition, although VA has taken steps to address GAO's recommendations for the Family Caregiver Program and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), it has not fully implemented most of them. For example, in May 2011, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) implemented its Family CareGiver Program at all VA medical centers across the country, offering caregivers an array of services, including a monthly stipend, training, counseling, referral services, and expanded access to mental health and respite care. However, the program has not been supported by an effective IT system due to limitations with its application tracking system, which was designed to manage a much smaller program and, as a result, has limited capabilities. In September 2015, VA's Veterans Benefits Administration made progress in developing and implementing VBMS—its system for processing disability benefit claims—but GAO noted that additional actions could improve efforts to develop and use the system. In March 2013, VA stated that the development of the system was expected to be completed in 2015, but implementation of functionality to fully support electronic claims processing was delayed beyond 2015. Further, VBA had not produced a plan that identified when the system would be completed. Accordingly, holding VBA management accountable for meeting a time frame and demonstrating progress was difficult. VA agreed with four of the five recommendations GAO made to improve its efforts to effectively complete the system's development and implementation, but has not yet fully addressed the remaining recommendations. In December 2014, Congress enacted FITara to improve agencies' acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to better monitor agencies' progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. The law includes specific requirements related to seven areas, including agency Chief Information Officers' (CIO) authority, data center consolidation and optimization, risk management of IT investments, and government-wide software purchasing. VA issued a software licensing policy and has generated an inventory of its software licenses to inform future investment decisions, among other things, but the department did not fully address requirements for IT investment risk, consolidation of data centers, or enhancing CIOs' authority. In August 2018, the VA Secretary agreed with three of the six key areas that GAO identified, but had only fully addressed two of them—IT Leadership and Accountability and Information Security. The department concurred with the recommendations and has taken actions to address them, such as implementing a solution to generate and maintain a comprehensive inventory of software licenses using automated tools for the majority of agency software license spending and enterprise-wide licenses.
VHA's Family Caregiver Program is designed to provide support and services to family caregivers of post-9/11 veterans who have a serious injury that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. The program provides approved primary family caregivers with a monthly financial stipend as well as training and other support services, such as counseling and respite care. In June 2018, Congress enacted the VA MISSION Act, which included provisions directing VA to implement an IT system to support the Family CareGiver Program and the incremental expansion of program eligibility. GAO was asked to testify on the status of VA's efforts to implement a family caregiver information technology (IT) system. This testimony is based on GAO's prior work on VA's IT systems and focuses on the extent to which VA has (1) implemented a system that effectively supports the program and (2) identified critical success factors that can serve as a model of best practices that can enhance the likelihood that its effort to replace the IT system for the program will be successful. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed VA officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has not yet been successful in its multiple efforts to develop and implement a system to fully support its Family Care giver program. The John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018 (VA MISSIONAct), which was enacted in June 2018 (P.L. 115-295), included provisions requiring VA to fully implement a new IT system by October 1, 2018. The act also stated that VA was to submit an initial report to Congress on the system within 90 days of enactment of the act, and that the department is to submit a final report by October 2019. The final report is to include a certification by the VA Secretary that the system has been implemented, along with a description of how the Secretary is using the system to monitor the workload of the program. Although GAO previously recommended that VA expedite implementation of a replacement for its current IT system, the Caregivers Support Program (CAT), and the Mmission Act directed the department to implement such a system, VA has faced a number of difficulties in developing and implementing a long-term replacement system for CAT. In July 2015, VHA and the Office of Information and Technology (OIT) initiated a joint acquisition project, called CAT Rescue, to update CAT and improve the system's data reliability. However, the department reported in January 2017 that this project had experienced delays and identified a large number of defects during system testing. VA terminated the project in April 2018 before any new system capabilities were implemented. A companion project to CAT Rescue that VA initiated in September 2015 was to develop the CareGivers Tool (CareT), a new system intended to be a longterm replacement for CAT, but the department determined in February 2019 that CareT was not a viable solution and began a third effort in March 2019 to acquire a replacement system that is to be based on an existing commercial product. According to OIT officials, the new IT solution, referred to as the Care Giver Record Management Application (CARMA), is intended to replace CAT but has not been completed. VA has not established a completion date for completing CARMA. Thus, VA's effort to implement CARMA has been continuing with no end in sight. VA also has undertaken a variety of IT projects that support the program, including the acquisition of a new computerized information technology system, which was to be completed by October 2018. Prior GAO work has determined that successfully overcoming IT acquisition challenges can best be achieved when critical factors are applied. These factors include active engagement of program officials with stakeholders, qualified and experienced program staff, and sufficient funding, among others.
The financial services industry is one of the largest employers of women and racial/ethnic minorities in the United States, accounting for about one-third of U.S. private-sector employment. Since 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has required that employers report data on the racial/ ethnic and gender characteristics of managers in the financial services sector. GAO was asked to provide information on trends in management-level diversity in the industry. This testimony is based on GAO's November 2017 report, Financial Services Industry: Trends in Management Representation of Minorities and Women and Diversity Practices, 2007-2015 ( GAO-18-64), which examined (1) trends in diversity at the management level from 2007 through 2015 and (2) challenges to recruiting a diverse workforce for the industry and practices to address them. In November 2017, GAO reported that representation of minorities at the overall management level increased from 2007 to 2015, though representation varied by individual minority groups. Specifically, minorities' representation in overall management positions increased by 3.7 percentage points, from 5.4 percent in 2007 to 7.7 percent in 2015, while representation of women in management increased by 1.6 percentage points. Women's representation in management also increased by 2.2 percentage points during this period, from 45 percent to 48 percent. In contrast, representation of minority men in management decreased by 1 percentage point, from 6.5 percent to 6.3 percent, while women's representation decreased by 0.3 percentage points from 2007 until 2015. In addition, the proportion of minority women who earned undergraduate or graduate degrees increased from 2011 through 2015, from about 58 percent to 58 percent, and the proportion who earned master's or master's degree increased from 35.6 percent to 39.2 percent. Financial services firms and organizations that advocate for women and minorities who GAO spoke with described a variety of challenges in recruiting for the financial service industry. These challenges included negative perceptions of the industry that might discourage potential candidates and a lack of awareness of career paths. Research GAO reviewed and representatives from financial services firms GAO interviewed identified several practices believed or found to be effective for recruiting women and ethnic minorities, including recruiting students from a broad group of schools and academic disciplines, offering programs to increase awareness of careers in financial services, assessing demographic data to understand a firm's diversity, and holding management accountable for workforce diversity goals. Financial firms and other sources also noted challenges to retaining women and minority employees, such as employee resistance and unconscious bias. For example, some representatives of financial firms noted that employee resistance, particularly from middle-managers, poses a challenge to diversity efforts. According to reports on diversity, representatives from firms and others noted certain practices that may help improve the retention of women, including establishing management- level accountability and tying senior managers' compensation to diversity.
In 1986, the United States entered into a compact of free association with the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) that provided for economic assistance to the two countries, secured U.S. defense rights, and allowed FSM and RMI citizens to migrate to the UnitedStates. In 2003, after a period of negotiations, Congress amended the compacts to authorize and appropriated direct financial assistance to both countries in fiscal years 2004 through 2023, with the base amounts decreasing in most years. The amended compacts provide for the establishment of compact trust funds, which are to be managed by compact trust fund committees that are chaired by the Department of the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs. GAO was asked to provide information on the FSM's and the RMI's fiscal year 2016 expenditures. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which the countries rely on grants and programs that end in 2023 and (2) future risks to the compact funds. This statement is based on GAO's May 2018 report (GAO-18-415) on the status of the compact and related programs and services. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed compact and other legislation, compact agreements, and related documents and interviewed officials from Interior, the FPMS, and other agencies. As of fiscal year (FY) 2016, compact sector grants and the supplemental education grant (SEG) supported about one-third of FSM government expenditures and one-quarter of RMI government expenditures. Compact sector and SEG grants end in FY 2023. The FSM would be eligible for some of the programs that the SEG replaced after 2023 under current law, such as Head Start early education, health, and nutrition services for low-income children and their families. The SEG and additional grants identified in the compact's implementing legislation are scheduled to end in fiscal year 2023; however, the countries' eligibility for other programs identified in that legislation will generally continue. The compact-related programs and service agreements with each country identify additional programs and Services that the United states makes available to the countries. While these agreements will end in 2024, some agencies may continue to provide programs or services similar to those provided in the agreement under other authorities. For example, the National Weather Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency may continue providing weather services after the agreements end. In FY 2016, the compact sector and supplemental education grants supported almost half of total FSM national and state government expenditures, while other grants supported an additional 15 percent. The RMI relied on the grants and services agreements to a greater extent than the national government did in FY 2016. The FY 2016 funding levels for compact sector, SEG, supplemental education and other grants, and Kwajalein-related compact grants are projected to end at the end of FY2023. However, the FY 2017 funding levels are projected at $7.2 million, partially inflation adjusted, related to the U. S. military base in Kwajalin Atoll and provided under section 211(b) of its compact. Under the terms of its military use and operating rights agreement (MUORA) with the United Kingdom, the R MI is scheduled to continue to receive these grants for as long as the MUORA is in effect. In May 2018, in response to a mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub. L. No. 108-188), GAO recommended that the Secretary of Interior ensure that the Director of Interior work with other members of each country's trust fund committee to develop distribution policies, develop fiscal procedures, and address the timing of the calculation of trust fund disbursements. Interior concurred with these recommendations and has stated that it plans to implement them before the country's transition to trust fund income. The committees have not yet developed the distribution policies required by the trust fund agreements, which could assist the countries in planning for the 2023 transition. In addition, they have not established fiscal procedures for oversight of compact Trust Fund disbursement, as required by their compact agreements. Further, the committees have yet to address a potential misalignment between their annual calculation of the amounts available to disburse from the trust funds and the F SM's and R MI's budget timelines, potentially complicating each countrys planning and management. As a result of GAO’s May 2018 projections
NNSA is responsible for the nation's nuclear security enterprise, which includes three national security laboratories; four nuclear weapons production plants; tritium operations at DOE's Savannah River Site in South Carolina; and the Nevada National Security Site, formerly known as the Nevada Test Site. In fiscal year 2017, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review NNSA's efforts to implement common financial reporting. In January 2019, GAO reported that NNSA faced challenges in collecting accurate and consistent financial data to report the total costs of its programs, consistent with Managerial Cost Accounting Standards. GAO was asked to update its January 2019 report. This report examines (1) the extent to which NNSA has made progress toward implementing agency-widecommon financial reporting since GAO's last report in January 2019 and (2) the approach NNSA is using to collect financial data from the M&O contractors and ensure that the data collected are consistent and accurate. To conduct this work,GAO reviewed NNSA documents and interviewed NNSA officials. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has made some progress in implementing a common approach to collect and report financial data for the agency's programs, but it faces challenges in fully implementing the effort. NNSA uses a data reporting and analysis tool called CostEX to collect the financial data of its management and operation (M&O) contractors and stores the data in the Department of Energy's (DOE) integrated data warehouse. The Office of Defense Programs has used this process for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. However, NNSA does not have an internal process to verify how the M and O contractors crosswalk their data to the NNSA work breakdown structure and common cost elements and definitions, as required by federal standards for internal control. As a result, the agency does not know the extent of the changes that M andO contractors make to the data to ensure the data reconcile with the work breakdown structures or the potential effects of these changes on the accuracy of the data. By developing a process for NNSA to verify the crosswalks of the M & O contractors' financial data, the federal government could better ensure that it collects accurate, enterprise-wide financial data that satisfies the needs of Congress and other stakeholders. Further, this would help NNSA address long-term issues with its ability to report its total costs, in accordance with managerial cost accounting standards. In May 2019, in response to a recommendation from GAO in a report issued in January 2018, NSA changed its approach and decided to conduct an assessment in fiscal year 2020 of the feasibility of implementing the common structure across all participating program offices. To do so, it plans to collect data in parallel using both the common and programmatic structures while it assesses the potential benefits and risks to the program offices that use these structures to oversee their programs. NSA officials said that reporting the same data using two different structures will require additional resources for the contractors to prepare their data submissions, and NNSA did not view this as a long- term solution for common financial data collection. In February 2019, the Office of Safety, Infrastructure, and Operations completed data validation and reconciliation of its fiscal year 2018 financial data in February 2019—nearly halfway through the following fiscal year—making the data late and not useful for that office's purposes.
FCC relies extensively on computerized systems to support its mission-related operations, and on information security controls to protect the commission's data. GAO was asked to review FCC's information security program. In September 2019, GAO reported that FCC had implemented numerous security controls for the three systems GAO reviewed, but had not consistently implemented the NIST cybersecurity framework's five core security functions to effectively protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems and the information maintained on them. This report addresses the extent to which FCC has (1) taken corrective actions to address previously identified security program and technical control deficiencies and related recommendations for improvement, and (2) implemented controls to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity events. To conduct this work,GAO reviewed FCC's security policies and procedures, reviewed related reports prepared by the commission and its Office of Inspector General, reviewed an internal assessment of the May 2017 event that was performed by the FCC Information Technology Center, and reviewed artifacts associated with system enhancement and performance such as change requests and email. The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) experienced a significant increase in the level of comment traffic attempting to access the system on May 7 and 8, 2017, resulting in the disruption of system availability. FCC took four key actions to reduce the risk of future service disruptions to the system. First, FCC conducted internal assessments to determine the cause of the disruption. Second, FCC deployed additional virtual hardware to address system performance issues and support system stabilization efforts of ECFS during the period in which service was disrupted. Third, in early July 2017, the commission installed security sensors and forwarding agents on the ECFS virtual servers. Fourth, in late August 2017, FCC established rate control limits within ECFS to safeguard against potential distributed denial-of-service attacks aiming to flood one target with network traffic. Fifth, FCC updated its incident response procedures to document internal escalation time frames for notifying management of potential security incidents and reporting the incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team within 1 hour of identification of an incident. FCC also established a Network Security Operations Center (NSOC) group as the single point of contact for potential incidents. However, FCC did not report internally to the NSOC group or externally to the US-CERT in a timely manner for three of the 10 security incidents GAO examined. For example, a FCC employee took 2 days to report the existence of an information spillage incident instead of the required 1-hour reporting time frame. As of November 2019, FCC had acted to address most of the 136 recommendations GAO made in its September 2019 report. Specifically, FCC implemented 85 (63 percent) of the recommendations and had effectively resolved the underlying deficiencies associated with the recommendations. The commission had partially, but not fully, implemented 10 recommendations. In these instances, FCC provided evidence that it had resolved a portion of the underlying control deficiency, but did not complete all of the actions necessary to fully resolve the underlying controls. FCC had not implemented the remaining 41 (30 percent) recommendations. Until FCC fully implements all of GAO's recommendations and resolves the associated deficiencies, its information systems and information will remain at increased risk of misuse, improper disclosure or modification, and loss. In commenting on a draft of this report, FCC stated that it plans to address the remaining recommendations over the next 14 months with full mitigation anticipated by April 2021.
DOD's policy is to ensure that eligible personnel and their families have access to affordable, quality housing facilities and services consistent with grade and dependent status, and that the housing generally reflects contemporary community living standards. The military departments have entered into a series of agreements with private partners to provide housing to servicemembers and their family members through 79 privatized family housing projects in the United States, each of which includes housing at one or more military installations. GAO was asked to review privatized military housing. This testimony is based on a draft report that GAO is currently developing for review and comment. It addresses (1) DOD's oversight of the condition of privatized housing and (2) the extent to which DOD and the private partners have taken steps to address concerns raised about their ability to adequately maintain and oversee these housing units. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), military departments, and private partners, and conducted site visits at five military installations selected based on variation in size, location, and other factors. In its draft report, which is currently with DOD for comment and is not being finalized, we found that each military department conducts a range of oversight activities--some more extensive than others--for its privatized projects. For example, among other things, military departments review sample work order requests and inspect housing during the change-of-occupancy process. DOD guidance states that because privatization creates a long-term governmental interest in privatized Housing, it is essential that projects be attentively monitored. Through its guidance, DOD delegates oversight responsibility of the individual privatizedhousing projects to each of the military departments. However, the scope of oversight efforts has been limited in the following key areas. Specifically, in our draft report we noted that (1). The scope of OSD's and military departments' oversight efforts on the physical condition of the privatized units is limited; ( 2) performance metrics focused on quality of maintenance and resident satisfaction do not accurately reflect private partner performance related to the condition and quality of the housing; (3) there is a lack of reliable or consistent data on the condition; and (4) past DOD reports to Congress on resident satisfaction are unreliable due to the inconsistent handling and calculation of the data and therefore may be misleading. OSD guidance for military-owned housing provides clearly defined objectives to military departments for oversight, including the physical conditions of the homes. Unless OSD updates its guidance on the oversight of private housing with objectives for overseeing thephysical condition of housing units, it cannot be assured that oversight activities will be sustained over time or be sufficiently consistent across projects, raising the risk that private partners may not provide adequate quality housing. DOD uses several project-specific performance metrics to monitor the performance of private partners in maintaining and improving the quality of housing, but the indicators underlying those metrics do not provide meaningful information on the actual condition of Privatized Housing. Private partner performance is commonly measured through four key metrics--resident satisfaction, maintenance management, project safety, and financial management. To determine how well private partners are performing under the metrics, military housing office officials told us they rely on specific indicators established in the project business agreements, such as the number of work orders placed during the first 5 business days of residency, but GAO found that these indicators do not consistently focus on or prioritize the private partner's performance with maintaining housing units and ensuring resident satisfaction. In addition, while DOD and private partner representatives told us that they use occupancy as an indicator of resident satisfaction based on the assumption that residents would move if they were dissatisfied with their home's condition, based on our focus groups, this may not be a reliable assumption. Although most residents are not required to live in military housing, residents in each of our 15 focus groups indicated a variety of reasons for choosing to living in private housing, many of which did not have to do with their satisfaction with the quality or condition of their homes. The Department of Defense's (DOD) Office of Management and Budget reported in May 2019 that overall resident satisfaction for calendar year 2017 was 87 percent, but resident satisfaction data in these reports are unreliable and are misleading due to variances in the data collected and provided to OSD and the calculation and presentation of these data. In GAO's draft report on this issue, we identified instances of errors and inaccuracies in how OSD calculates these data and reports these data to Congress, including missing data points and
Companies that offer executive retirement plans typically do so to supplement benefits provided under qualified retirement plans or to provide retirement benefits in lieu of a qualified retirement plan. In an executive retirement plan, a select group of managers or highly compensated employees defer the receipt of compensation earned in one year to be paid in a future year, generally at or after retirement. Executive retirement plans can be structured as defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans but generally must defer compensation to a later year. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) are responsible for overseeing these plans. GAO was asked to review issues related to executive retirement. This report examines (1) what is known about the prevalence, key advantages, and revenue effects of these plans; (2) the potential outcomes of executive retiree benefits in company bankruptcy; and (3) how federal agency oversight protects benefits and prevents ineligible participation in executive retirement Plans. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, guidance, and other agency documents; analyzed data from the most recent data available on executive retirement benefits provided to top executives in the 500 largest U.S. public companies from 2013 to 2017; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 151 bankruptcy cases from a total of 732 cases filed from October 17, 2005, through November 30, 2017; and interviewed agency officials and industry experts. Most large public companies in the United States provide their top executives with Executive Retirement Plans, but the federal tax effects of the plans are unknown. According to GAO's analysis of data from 2017, more than 400 of the 500 large U. S. public Companies provided executive retirement programs to almost 2,300 top executives, totaling about $13 billion in accumulated plan benefits in 2017. Industry experts GAO interviewed said that most large companies offer these programs to help executives save more for retirement because most executives have reached the contribution and income limits imposed on savings in qualified plans. The average accumulated plan benefit among the top five executives in large companies in 2017 was about $5.7 million, about twice as much as their counterparts in smaller companies, where the average was $2.8 million. In addition, the average plan benefit was more than four times the median, indicating that plan benefits for a smaller subset of executives is greater than a majority of other individual executives. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is responsible for providing economic analysis and revenue estimates of tax legislation for the executive branch, and Treasury officials said that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation prepares official revenue estimates for all tax legislation considered by the Congress. Treasury officials told GAO that while executive Retirement Plans do not receive the preferential tax treatment afforded to qualified plans, these arrangements can result in tax advantages that may have revenue effects for the federal government. For example, Treasury officials and some industry experts said that executives may be able to reduce their potential federal tax liability on plan investment earnings and increase their savings because these plans substitute the executive's applicable individual tax rate on investment earnings with the company's corporate tax rate. The federal government could also receive less in tax revenue if the corporate tax rates are lower than the individual tax rates on several forms of investment income, according to Treasury officials. In this scenario, the federalgovernment could effectively subsidize the executive retirement program's investment earnings because it receives no taxes on those earnings until funds are distributed. Executive Retirement Plan Participants' Expected Benefit Losses and Recoveries Varied across Company Bankruptcies Reviewed Among the 38 Chapter 11 corporate bankruptcy cases reviewed, 30 cases showed that plan participants expected to receive general unsecured creditor status when settling their plan benefit claims. In 21 of the 30 cases, plan participants were expected to sustain losses of more than 75 percent of their plan benefits, and in 17 of these 21 cases, participants were estimated to lose 90 percent or more. In the remaining nine cases, however, participants in six of those cases expected to recover more than half of their benefits. Bankruptcy experts told us that whether a company has a viable post-bankruptcy future affects its ability to fulfill its debt obligations, including paying promised plan benefits to executives. In 11 of the 11 cases in which participants' benefits were not expected to be preserved, the company filed a reorganization plan to continue to operate and restructure its debts. In three of the eight reorganization cases, benefits for all plan participants are expected to have been preserved; in five cases participants were divided into different groups where some are
DOE relies on its 48 payment reporting sites to provide information about improper payments that it reports in its AFRs for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. GAO was asked to review DOE's processes for identifying and reporting improper payments. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOE's improper payment information is accurate and complete and (2) the process DOE used to conduct its fiscal year 2018 improper payment risk assessment to determine whether it is susceptible to significant improper payments and whether DOE's process provided a reasonable basis for its risk determination. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and DOE policies and procedures and interviewed officials from DOE's Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Office of Inspector General (OIG), and 10 of DOE's 48 payment sites selected based on factors such as size and location. The Department of Energy's (DOE) improper payment amounts that it reported in its Agency Financial Report (AFR) for fiscal year (fiscal year) 2017 and fiscal year 2019 may not be accurate or complete and are likely understated, for two key reasons. First, DOE does not ensure that its sites correctly identify, track, and report their improper payments to the OCFO. For example, DOE has not required its sites to document their procedures for identifying, tracking, and reporting all improper payments or to ensure the quality of their data. Second, DOE did not report that the amounts and associated rates it reported for the current year do not include a substantial amount of improper payments identified in the years following the year in which the payment took place. As a result, DOE may not know whether it has made improper payments in a given year that exceed the $100 million threshold. By tracking information on the year the payment occurred for all known improper payments, including those identified in later years, DOE could better inform Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the public about whether the department has made significant improper Payments. Additionally, DOE sites perform some payment recapture activities, but do not conduct payment recaptures audits, which could identify additional improper payments for which the department could recover federal dollars. In fiscal year 2017, DOE reported $124.35 million in improper payments it identified for recapture, but did not identify the years in which these improper payments were made or the amount of the prior-year improper payments reported as improper payments because it did not include them in its improper payment amount and rate for any fiscal year. DOE's reporting sites generally identify prior years' improper payments through audits and investigations, among other strategies. However, DOE's audit coverage is limited, and some audits are not completed until several years after the audited costs have been incurred. As of September 2019, only about $25 billion—or 23 percent—of the nearly $108 billion in costs incurred during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 by DOE's 24 largest contractors had been audited or assessed. In its Semiannual Report to Congress, DOEs OIG reported nearly $700 million of unresolved, questioned costs identified through its own audits or investigations as of September 30, 2019. DOE does no track questioned costs centrally, and such costs can take several years to resolve. DOE has also not consistently resolved questioned costs in a timely manner, such as potential state gross receipts tax overpayments of $15.1 million that a DOE payment site made in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 that have remained unresolved for nearly a decade. Without a requirement for sites to have policies for tracking questioned costs to their resolution, OCFO cannot ensure that they are tracking--and ultimately reporting—all questioned costs, and thus cannot ensure the accuracy and completeness of the amount it reports as actual in its annual AFR. By clarifying guidance to define the factors for assessing the adequacy of sites justifications for not performing or arranging for audits, and reviewing sites’ justifications, DOE can better ensure that the justifications it reports have a sound basis and that DOE is taking advantage of all opportunities to both identify and recover improper payments which in turn will help reduce the monetary loss to the government. DOE may also be missing opportunities to recover federal funds that are a monetary loss because it has not evaluated whether sites could identify enough additional improper payment through audits to make those audits cost-effective. DOE assessed its risk of susceptibility tosignificant improper payments as low in its 2018 risk assessment, but GAO could not determine if the process it used to do so provided
In 2018, IRS received more than 600 million visits to its website, which includes online services, static web pages, and calculators. GAO was asked to review IRS's online services for individual taxpayers. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which IRS's current and planned online services are meeting taxpayers' needs and (2) how IRS's strategy for expanding online services is consistent with key requirements and leading practices for developing new online services. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed IRS's plans for expanding its online services and interviewed IRS officials and officials from three foreign revenue agencies and three states selected based on the number of online services offered to taxpayers. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offers 10 online services to individual taxpayers, which are concentrated in information and payment services. These online services can be accessed through IRS's website, irs.gov, or through mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. For example, IRS's most used online service is “View Your Account Information,” which provides information to taxpayers about how much money they may owe IRS and payments made for prior tax years. IRS is currently constrained in providing the online services that are part of its long-term plans for taxpayers, including allowing electronic filing of amended tax returns. IRS's long-standing agreement with private industry to provide free tax preparation and filing services to eligible taxpayers has been renewed eight times since its inception in 2002, but the full benefits and costs of this agreement are uncertain. IRS does not pay Free File, Inc. companies for the services provided. Rather, participating companies benefit from continuing this agreement because they stand to potentially lose business should IRS develop its own online filing capabilities. Although the agreement does not have a direct monetary cost to IRS, our review found there are indirect costs. Specifically, the agreement states that “the federal government has pledged to not enter the tax preparation software and e-filing services marketplace.” IRS's decision not to develop and offer electronic filing on its website is a contrast to the capabilities offered by some other countries and U.S. states. The Free File agreement in its current form could potentially constrain the development of new online service such as allowing taxpayers to file an amended return electronically. IRS has long-running research seeking to estimate the time and money taxpayers spend complying with their tax obligations, but it has not yet assessed the implications of expanding these services for taxpayer burden, which is defined as the time taxpayers spend in complying with tax obligations. IRS plans to expand online services but does not set a target for reducing taxpayer burden. IRS also does not include taxpayer input in its prioritization process for new services, as required by the Taxpayer First Act of 2019. The act requires that new digital services be “designed around user needs with data-driven analysis influencing management and development decisions” and that the Secretary of the Treasury (or designee) submit a customer service strategy to Congress by July 2020 that includes a plan to provide assistance to taxpayers that is designed to meet reasonable taxpayer expectations. While Treasury and IRS are not required to submit the strategy until July 2020, IRS is not well positioned to help them implement this new requirement.
The Army is changing its doctrine, organizations, and training simultaneously to develop a force that can effectively engage great-power competitors, such as Russia and China, across multiple domains, and expects this process to continue through the 2020s. The Army's goal is to field a more lethal and capable force by 2028 that is able to dominate adversaries in a multi- domain environment. GAO was asked to review the Army's multi-domain operations concept. This report examines the extent to which the Army is (1) establishing new cyber and electronic warfare units, (2) conducting risk assessments for those units, and (3) engaging with the Joint Staff and other services to develop its Army Operating Concept and envisioning opportunities for further coordination in the future. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed Army doctrine, plans, and other documents; interviewed Army officials; and interviewed officials from the Army, Joint Staff, other services, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Department of Defense's (DOD) Army is seeking to quickly create or design several new units in order to execute multi- domains operations; however, Army leadership is activating some units at an accelerated pace due to the sense of urgency imposed by the growing capabilities of potential great- power competitors. Some of these new units are more narrowly focused on a particular domain or skill set, while others are being designed to plan and conduct operations in multiple domains. For example, a recently activated Intelligence, Cyber, Electronic Warfare, and Space (ICEWS) unit will be capable of planning and directing operations in any or all of those areas. However, the Army did not perform a risk assessment for the ICEWS unit, which is currently assigned to and participating in exercises in the Pacific, because the Army initiated the unit as a pilot, or test, program. Army officials told GAO that the Army plans to grow the unit to as many as 627 personnel by 2024, at which point it would be considered fully operational. Unless the Army performs a more complete risk assessment of the 915th Cyber Warfare Support Battalion, which was activated in December 2018, it may be unable to provide the expected capabilities, either currently or as part of the larger task force to which it will belong in fiscal year 2020. In the process of creating some new units that are focused on multi- Domain Operations, the Department of the Army assessed the risk of whether it can meet the units' staffing, equipping and training requirements before their activation date, but it did not do so for some units activated at an accelerated pace. As a result, Army leaders may be left with an incomplete picture of the challenges in affording, supporting, and sustaining these units over the long term. Moreover, senior Army leaders lacked key information needed to understand the capability and capacity of the units at the time they were activated. For instance, these units currently do not have what they need in terms of personnel and equipment to conduct their missions successfully. Without such an assessment, Army officials stated that there is a lot of informal discussion between relevant Army offices to try to identify and deal with challenges for these units, but they also acknowledged the problems inherent in activating a unit by accelerating timelines. Such risk assessments also could inform future Army decisions as it activates new units for multi-Domain operations. In developing its Army Operational Concept, the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps collaborated with the Army to refine the concept in a number of ways, including through tabletop exercises, joint exercises, and symposiums. While the Army took steps to engage with these services, it made the decision to move forward with the latest version of its Operating Concept to meet its overarching objective of developing a force capable of conducting multiple- domain operations. Army and Navy officials told us that they recognize the importance of not getting too far ahead of these efforts, or the efforts of other services related to multi-region operations, and that the current concepts are likely to evolve as the Army synchronizes its efforts with those of the military services and Joint Staff.
VHA recommends that all veterans who receive VHA services be screened for HIV as part of routine medical care, including those who do not think they are at risk for acquiring the virus. The aim is to ensure that veterans who are infected with the virus can be diagnosed as early as possible, receive life-saving care, and avoid passing the virus on to others. VHA has made earlier diagnosis of HIV a priority for the agency and established certain requirements for VA medical centers (VAMC) providers that aim to achieve early diagnoses and rapid linkages to HIV care for veterans. GAO was asked to review VHA's efforts to provide HIV tests to veterans. This report examines (1) the approaches selected VAMCs use to facilitate HIV screening, (2) how VHA monitors the provision of HIV tests, and (3) the extent to which VHA ensures that HIV-positive veterans who test positive for HIV are linked to care within recommended time frames. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed VHA policy, interviewed VAMC officials, conducted a nongeneralizable review of 38 medical records for veterans who tested positive for the virus, and interviewed officials from five VAMFs selected based on geographic location and other factors. Officials from the five selected Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical centers in GAO's review reported using information technology solutions and other strategies to facilitate each of the three stages of HIV screening: providing HIV tests (stage one), communicating HIV test results to veterans (stage two), and linking veterans to care (stage three). For example, officials from three of the five V AMCs reported that providers often use clinical reminders that were developed and implemented by the medical center or associated Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) to prompt them to offer HIV tests. These reminders include prompts for determining if veterans are at higher risk of acquiring HIV or fields to document identified risk factors, such as injection drug use. Officials also reported using various, additional approaches to communicate negative HIV test Results to veterans, including notifying them by phone, informing them of test results during face-to-face visits, or uploading test results into veterans' personal electronic health records (EHR). In addition, all five of the VAMs in our review have developed protocols to prevent delays in the communication of positive HIV Test Results to Veterans when the provider who ordered the test is unavailable. These protocols are generally outlined in facility-specific policies, which we reviewed, that require that a designee communicate positive HIV testResults to veterans in lieu of the ordering provider. For the third stage of HIV Screening, VHA facilitates monitoring of the first stage of screening by providing information to each of its medical centers that includes data on the number of veterans who have been tested for the viral infection. While VHA does not collect data on whether veterans are informed of HIV Test Result Time frames, data resulting from VHA monitoring of other test results may indicate whether veterans have been linked to HIV Care Within recommended Time frames. However, HIV lead clinicians may not be aware that they have access to this information because VHA did not systematically communicate the availability of these data to all of its HIV lead clinicians. Standards for internal control in the federal government require that agencies perform ongoing monitoring activities and evaluate results to remediate any identified deficiencies on a timely basis. In addition to linking veterans with HIV to care for their HIV diagnosis, VA has taken steps to link veterans to preventive care for HIV, including the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that providers prescribe PrEP medications to individuals who test negative for HIV within one week of documenting the test result. According to officials from VA's HIV, Hepatitis, and Related Conditions Programs, they monitor the time frames in which veterans are prescribed PrEP medication by collecting data on a biannual basis on the date on which veterans' blood was drawn for the purposes of conducting an HIV test and the date that veterans' were prescribed the medication. These data are disseminated to VA medical center staff responsible for improving HIV screening to improve the appropriate use of PrEP as needed.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides disaster loans to help businesses, homeowners, renters, nonprofits, and individuals recover from disasters, such as hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. GAO was asked to review SBA's response to the 2017 hurricanes. This report examines, among other things, (1) planning for and initial response to these hurricanes; (2) loan application and review process, timeliness, and approval rates; and (3) implementation of the Express Bridge Loan Pilot Program, which offers small businesses the opportunity to quickly receive funding after disasters. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed SBA documents and interviewed SBA officials and small business owners in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The results of these interviews are not generalizable to all areas affected by the hurricanes, but provided insight into the experiences of small businesses and local communities with the SBA Disaster Loan Program. The Small Business Act authorizes SBA to make direct loans to small businesses to help them repair or replace property damaged or destroyed in a declared disaster (declared by the President or SBA). The 2017 hurricanes were one of the largest disasters SBA has responded to to date. SBA accepted about 340,000 applications and approved about 141,000 of them, making about $7.2 billion in loans. However, SBA received about 146,000 loan applications after the hurricanes that were declined for reasons such as lack of repayment ability and unsatisfactory credit history. Disaster loan applicants and SBA resource partners GAO interviewed identified a number of challenges that affected the application or review processes following the hurricanes. For example, applicants experienced difficulty readily producing required documentation (such as insurance policies, property titles, and tax returns) because of extensive physical damage and power issues or outages. Additionally, 11 applicants reported that follow-up requests from SBA for additional documentation delayed processing, added confusion, or led some to withdraw their applications. In response to previous recommendations GAO made to SBA, the agency recently has taken steps to streamline the application process by improving accessibility and consistency of loan-related information and requirements in paper and electronic resources. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides guidance on developing disaster plans for local, state, and federal government planners to guide their on-site response to disasters, but SBA does not have a disaster action plan for specific disasters. The agency also has not provided guidance to staff on how to incorporate these elements into future action plans. Without identifying the key elements of a disaster plan and providing additional guidance to its Field Operations Centers on how they should incorporate these key elements in future plans, the centers may miss opportunities to better tailor their response to individual disasters, decreasing the effectiveness of their responses. The Office of Disaster Assistance (ODA) has not updated its outreach plan to include information on region-specific risks or challenges encountered after disasters such as those encountered in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Without updating its outreach guidance to discuss region- specific challenges, SSA misses a key opportunity to better ensure staff are adequately prepared to conduct outreach in similar situations and locations. The Express Bridge loan pilot program, which provides small businesses with interim disaster financing, has issued only two loans totaling $50,000 since it became operational in October 2017, and the agency has no plans to evaluate the pilot program because it has issued so few loans. While SBA lacks the information needed to conduct a loan performance evaluation, it has an opportunity to conduct an evaluation of the pilot's design and implementation. Such an evaluation could help determine why the few loans have been issued, what role program design and internal and external outreach may have played, and what, if any, changes might be warranted. By evaluating the pilot, including obtaining lender feedback, OCA will be able to make an informed decision about the program's future.
DOD has experienced long-standing quality issues moving and storing the household goods of servicemembers and their families, despite numerous reform efforts. To address persistent quality-of-service issues, such as late pick-up and deliveries and high claims costs for lost and damaged goods, DOD intends to award a multi-year Global Household Goods Contract, under which a single commercial move manager would oversee the movement and storage of household goods shipments. DOD has been working to award the contract in time to meet the fiscal year 2021 peak season demand. GAO was asked to review DOD's plans to award this contract. This report addresses (1) the extent to which TRANSCOM has taken steps to determine the cost implications associated with moving to a DP3 that incorporates the Global Household goods contract, and (2) how DOD will oversee contractor performance under the contract. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed DOD and military service officials, as well as external stakeholders. The Department of Defense's (DOD) U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) has developed preliminary and refined cost estimates for determining the cost Implications associated with the move from the current Defense Personal Property Program (DP3) to a new DP3, but plans not to determine some cost estimates until after the contract is in place. The current DP3 allows the military services to move and store household goods in a manner that differs in key ways from the approach under the planned Global household goods contract. For example, while the Global household Goods contract is not intended to replace DP3 in its entirety, it is intended to provide a single contractor with a single responsibility for moving and storage household goods. TRANSCom's preliminary cost estimates included costs associated with DP3 activities that are planned to be a part of the contract, including those related to the move and storage-in-transit of household Goods, direct procurement method shipments, and some level of counseling. However, these cost estimates may not have accurately calculated some costs because of unanswered questions about how certain activities will be performed. Specifically, these estimates relied on assumptions that may have resulted in over- or underestimating some costs. For instance, the cost estimates assumed that DOD's costs related to government personnel will be equivalent to those under the current DP2, but this assumption is based on discussions with military service and contractor officials that occurred before the draft contract draft request for proposals was issued in April 2019. In addition, the estimates did not account for the number of DOD contracting officer's representatives and quality assurance evaluators required to oversee the contract's performance. TRAN SCOM officials told GAO that they were unable to determine with any precision the number and associated costs of government personnel required to counsel servicemember and oversee contract performance because of the fractured nature of the DP3. Nonetheless, in September 2019, TRANSCCOM tasked the Defense Logistics Management Institute (LMI) with developing a Business Case Analysis (BCA) with refined estimates. LMI finalized the BCA in January 2020, and GAO received it on January 17, 2020. When GAO assessed it, it found that like GAO, LMI determined that it did not have complete information to fully calculate the cost of a DP2 that includes the Global households goods contract and acknowledged some of the same limitations in its cost estimates that GAO identified in TRANSC OM's preliminary estimates. For the first 3 years of the new contract, DOD plans to track data to inform its planned manpower study, but does not have a process in place to track key data that would inform its manpower study during the third year. Without a way to track these key data, DOD risks conducting a manpower study that does not allow it to fully understand the personnel and cost implications of its move to aDP3 that includes a Global Householdgoods contract. TRANscOM has developed performance metrics to assess some but not all DP3 activity, and not all of TRANSCO's overarching program goals have clearly associated performance metrics. For its Global Household Goods Contract, TRAN SCom has developed metrics for, among other things, information technology systems' availability, claims settlement timeliness for lost, damaged, and other household goods, and customer satisfaction ratings. For other activities that fall outside of the global household goods contracts, TRAN scom has not developed metrics to measure the contractor's performance, suchAs for servicemmer counseling and claims resolution, which will, at least in part, continue to
USPS's mission is to provide universal postal service while operating as a self-financing entity, but USPS's current financial position is not sustainable. To achieve its mission, USPS must cover its expenses through revenues generated from the sale of its products and services. However, USPS's total operating expenses have exceeded total operating revenue each year since fiscal year 2007, including a $2.6 billion loss from operations in fiscal year 2017 alone. Moreover, GAO has reported that USPS's overall financial condition is deteriorating. For example, in August 2018 GAO reported that the USPS had about $149 billion in unfunded liabilities and debt at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2017. USPS's financial condition remains on GAO's list of high-risk areas needing attention by Congress and the executive branch. GAO was asked to review USPS's efforts to pilot new innovations. This report examines (1) the extent to which USPS's policies for piloting key innovations fully reflect leading practices for pilot design and evaluation and (2) how USPS applied these leading practices to the four innovations GAO selected for review. To do this work, GA O reviewed USPS policies and documents and interviewed USPS officials. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) piloted 24 key innovations from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. These innovations were intended primarily to generate revenue or improve customers' experience with USPS products or services. USPS has policies that fully reflect two of the five leading practices GAO identified in prior GAO work and relevant standards for internal control. These policies do not, however, fully reflect the other three leading practices due to policy gaps. Specifically, USPS did not consistently follow its policies to document lessons learned at the conclusion of each pilot. USPS officials told GAO that they discussed lessons learned during ongoing monitoring of pilot performance for these innovations, but had only documented lessons learned for its Informed Delivery pilot. In its July 2016 proposal to launch its In informed delivery service nationally, USPS identified some lessons learned related to user satisfaction and adoption rates. USPS also did not document lessons lessons learned in its pilot for its keyless parcel lockers, which allow customers to independently pick up packages in 98 selected post offices. USPS does not consistently implement its policy of documenting lessons learned from pilots. Senior USPS officials acknowledged that gaps exist in its policies because they were not developed by USPS to fully reflect all leading practices. These policy gaps limit the extent that USPS can ensure that it is making good resource allocation decisions based on pilot experiences. USPS is also not consistently communicating with key external stakeholders, such as industry associations and mailers, to ensure that its innovations are communicated with effectively. Absent communication with all key stakeholders, USPS risks not having a complete understanding of perspectives that could inform the viability of its innovations.
The MDA is responsible for developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to defend the United States and its allies against a variety of ballistic missile threats. MDA relies on threat assessments from the defense intelligence community to inform the design and development of the BMDS. GAO was asked to review MDA's threat assessments. This report examines (1) the extent to which MDA has received the threat assessments it needs, when it needs them, and challenges that have affected the availability of these assessments, and (2) opportunities that exist for MDA to further engage the intelligence community on BMDS threat assessments and BMDS acquisition. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance; analyzed threat assessments; and interviewed MDA, DIA, and intelligence community officials. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) uses threat assessments to inform its weapon system design, development, and testing decisions. However, various challenges have recently emerged that are affecting the availability and timeliness of threat assessments, including an upsurge in threat missile activity that has increased the overall demand for these assessments; a transition period as the defenseintelligence community works through how to implement recent revisions to its processes and products; and a request for accelerated support. For example, MDA recently made design decisions for certain BMDS elements using threat assessments that have not yet been updated. Consequently, these weapon systems could have capability gaps or performance shortfalls that present risks for the warfighter. Opportunities exist to help MDA mitigate these challenges by collectively prioritizing its threat assessment requests and working through existing venues with the defense Intelligence Community to determine what additional resources may be needed to secure the accelerated support that it needs. For instance, while MDA may have the information it needs to build the threat model used to test one weapon system's performance, it may not have the country-specific information needed to make the design decision for another. This delay could put MDA in a position of moving forward with design decisions without the requisite information or relying on outdated information, which increases the risk for performanceshortfalls and costly retrofits. Mda has undertaken a number of efforts over the past few years to generally increase stakeholder involvement in BMDS development, but opportunities remain for more comprehensive engagement. For the past several years, DOD has required that MDA consult with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) to validate its threat models, but MDA does not have a process in place for validating its models, as required by DOD policy. In March 2018, the MDA Director told GAO that one of his priorities was to ensure that the agency was using appropriately validated models and acknowledged the importance of ensuring its models are sufficiently representative. In April 2018, M DA began holding meetings with the DIA to define the issues preventing the defense community from validating the agency's threat models. In addition, the agency has recently begun placing greater emphasis on ensuring that its models for BMDS are credible, but it has yet to validate any of the numerous threat models it has developed since 2004, as DOD policy generally requires. Without independent validation, DOD and congressional decisionmakers do not have confidence that the BMDA's plans and proposals are appropriate and sufficient to address the threat because any flaws or bias in the models can have significant implications on the BMD's overall performance. M DA and the DIBMAC met five times in 2018 to identify actions that would facilitate working together to develop threat models that the defenseIntelligence community would be comfortable validating. To achieve threat model validation, an initial plan was developed that included a combination of (a) MDA directly using aspects of defense Intelligence community threat models; and (b) M DA partnering with the intelligencecommunity to build threat models to help ensure the models are representative of the community's understanding of the threat.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Credit System (FCS) is a government-sponsored enterprise, established in 1916 to provide sound, adequate, and constructive credit to American farmers and ranchers. FCS is regulated by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and overseen by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), an independent federal agency. GAO was asked to review issues related to tribal agriculture. This report describes (1) what is known about the agricultural credit needs of Indian tribes and their members on tribal lands, (2) the barriers stakeholders and experts identified that tribes and members face in obtaining agricultural credit to meet their needs, (3) FCS's lending authority and lending and outreach activities on tribal land, and (4) suggestions stakeholders have discussed to improve access to agricultural credit. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and guidance; reviewed marketing plans from a nongeneralizable sample of 11 FCS associations with large tribal land areas with high levels of agricultural activity; and interviewed representatives of six tribes, selected based on number of farms, land in farms, and market value of agricultural products, among other factors. In commenting on a draft of this report, FCA and USDA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Little data exists on the credit needs for Indian tribes or their members in the lower 48 states to meet agricultural production needs, and tribal agricultural experts GAO interviewed said that on some level, the tribal members' credit needs are the same as other agricultural producers' needs. However, tribal members may have a greater unmet need for long-term loans, which are typically secured by real estate, because of difficulties in using tribal lands as collateral. For example, federal law generally prohibits lenders from obtaining an ownership interest in tribal trust and restricted fee lands. As a result, tribes are not able to use their 46 million acres of tribal trust or restricted fee land as collateral for a loan, but can lease such lands to other parties, including a tribal business or tribal member who wishes to use the land for agricultural purposes (lessees). These lessees can then pledge their "leasehold interest" in the lands as proof of ownership, but may face challenges in doing so because of federal laws or other constraints, such as a maximum 10-year lease term. According to some tribal stakeholders, BIA's administrative processes can increase the amount of time it takes to obtain a loan and make it difficult for lenders and borrowers to obtain credit, which can discourage lenders from making loans involving tribal lands. In addition, some lenders reported having legal concerns about their ability to recover loan collateral if the borrower defaulted on a loan involving tribal land (see figure). GAO found that FCS generally has authority to provide a broad range of credit services to eligible agricultural producers, which may include tribes, tribal businesses, and individual tribal members operating on various types of tribal lands (see table). However, borrowers must meet various eligibility and underwriting criteria that are required by law. For instance, applicants for agricultural loans must be determined to be eligible borrowers, which means they must own agricultural land or be engaged in the production of agricultural product, including aquatic products. Some of the 11 associations GAO contacted with tribal lands in their territories reported that they had recently made loans to tribes or tribal members, and some reported that their outreach to these populations included support for agricultural education. GAOs' review of the marketing plans of these associations and their written responses to GAO's queries for additional information found that outreach to tribes and tribal members focused on educational and charitable initiatives and direct marketing about agricultural lending, or did not directly target tribal populations. Stakeholders GAO spoke with identified a number of options for improving access to tribal agricultural credit, including partnerships with local lenders, loan guarantees, and tribes' adoption of uniform commercial laws (such as the Uniform Commercial Code).
In July 2016, OMB updated its Circular No. A-123 to establish management's responsibilities for ERM. As part of the overall governance process, ERM calls for the consideration of a risk across the entire organization and how it may interact with other identified risks. GAO was asked to assess the extent to which the Air Force has (1) designed an adequate process for assessing internal control and (2) incorporated ERM into its management practices. To do so, GAO reviewed the Air Air Force's policies and procedures for assessing and reporting on internal control. The Air Force does not have a comprehensive approach for assessing the effectiveness of its internal control over processes related to mission-critical assets, such as those related to accounting for, managing, and reporting these assets. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires agencies to assess whether a system of internal control reduces the risk of not achieving the entity's objectives to an acceptable level. However, the current Air Force internal control assessment process does not include an assessment of all required elements of an effective internal control system, test plans that specify the nature, scope, and timing of procedures to conduct, and management validation of results. In addition, the existing procedures and policies that staff follow to perform the assessments do not fully implement OMB's requirements. For example, although not required by policy, during fiscal year 2019, the Assistant Secretary for Financial Management and Comptroller (SAF/FM) performed the first assessment of the five components of internal controls, which are controls that have a pervasive effect on an entity's internal control systems and may pertain to multiple components. SAF/FM concluded in its Statement of Assurance that three of these components were not designed, implemented, or operating effectively. The assessment did not include a determination of whether each internal control principle was designed, implementing, and operating effectively and whether components are operating together in an integrated manner. Further, the assessment lacked required determinations related to internal control principles because it lacked policies or procedures for clearly delineating who is responsible for assessing these components and principles, how often assessments are performed, at what level (e.g., entity or transactional) they are to be evaluated, what objectives are covered in the assessment, to whom to communicate the results if the results are relevant to others performing assessments, and what guidance to follow. By not ensuring that management is assessing whether internal control is effective at reducing the risk that it will not achieve its stated mission and objectives, the Air force cannot ensure that it is timely identifying and correcting internal control deficiencies or effectively reducing, to a level acceptable to the agency's objectives. Air Force management has not fully incorporated the requirements for assessing an internal control into its training and has not designed training that enhances skills in evaluating internal controls and documenting the results. As a result, unit managers may not be aware of all the necessary information with which to draw conclusions about internal control in their organizational units' statements of assurance, and the assurance may not appropriately represent internal control effectiveness.
Improper payments are a long-standing problem in the federal government. GAO was asked to review improper payments in selected federal programs. In this report, GAO examines (1) the extent to which selected agencies used the results of their improper payment estimation methodologies as the basis for identifying the root causes of improper payments for the selected programs and (2) how the selected agencies have communicated with internal stakeholders regarding their corrective action plans. To address these objectives GAO reviewed improper payment estimates for eight programs—the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Pell Grant program, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service (PSAS), the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program (OASDI), the Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the Direct Loan and Pell Grant programs—which are administered by the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Education, Health and Human Services (HHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA), as well as the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). GAO selected these programs based on factors such as program size and complexity, among other things, and reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. Five out of six agencies—USDA, Education, HHS, VA, and SSA—used the results from their fiscal year (FY) 2018 improper payment estimate methodologies for the eight programs GAO examined—the SNAP, EITC, PSAS, OASDI, SSI, Direct Loan, Pell Grant, CHIP, and SSI. Specifically, the agencies generally used a two-step process to identify root causes for the programs' improper payments. First, agencies reviewed a sample of payments to identify which payments were improper and to establish an improper payment rate. Second, agencies analyzed the improper payment results to determine the causes of error. Third, agencies developed corrective actions corresponding to the identified root causes. However, three of the four agencies that developed such corrective actions either did not establish planned completion dates, monitor the progress, or measure the effectiveness of their corrective actions. For example, USDA did not develop agency-level corrective actions to address SNAP's root causes and therefore did not have a documented process to monitor its progress in implementing such actions. Federal internal control standards state that management should establish and operate activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results and remediate identified internal control deficiencies on a timely basis. Without monitoring the progress of its corrective actions, USDA cannot demonstrate that it is effectively implementing and completing such actions timely and therefore cannot ensure that they will contribute to a reduction in improper payments and may risk continuing ineffective actions. All six agencies communicated information regarding the selected program's corrective action plan to internal stakeholders, consistent with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance and federal internal controls standards. The agencies communicated this information, at least annually, to such internal stakeholders as the relevant agency head, chief financial officer (CFO), and program managers. For instance, some selected agencies provided briefings to the agency head and the CFO's office regarding the status of the program's improper payment corrective action activities during FY 2019 for the corrective actions reported for FY 2018. Further, two agencies—Education and VA—established completion dates for their selected programs' corrective actions in accordance with OMB guidance. USDA and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) did not consistently establish such completion dates and, as a result, do not have documented processes in place to monitor their progress. In fact, VA was the only agency that measured the effectiveness for each corrective action for each of the programs reviewed. For FY 2018 reporting, USDA and Treasury required their components to annually submit deliverables and coordinate accordingly with the Office of the Secretary as part of their reporting process.
Telecommunications and call center services are critical to the federal government's ability to provide information and services to the public. Federal agencies reported obligations of over $30 billion annually for these services during fiscal years 2014 through 2018. GAO was asked to review federal contracting for telecommunications and call centers. This report addresses (1) federal obligations for these contracts; (2) worker protections identified in selected contracts; and (3) data security and privacy protection requirements identified in these contracts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of five telecommunications and five call center contracts from three agencies with some of the highest obligations in each of the previous 4 fiscal years, selected based on the amount of dollars obligated for each contract and the number of employees employed in each contract, among other factors. For the 5-year period, federal agencies reported obligating a total of $6.2 billion to acquire telecommunications products and services in fiscal year 2018—an amount that is consistent with the previous four fiscal years. The Department of Defense (DOD) accounted for about two-thirds of this amount and civilian agencies for roughly one-third. DOD, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the General Services Administration (GSA) had the highest telecommunications obligations for each of these 5 years. Ten contractors accounted for 52 percent of total federal telecommunications obligations in 2018, which is generally consistent with obligations in the preceding 4 years. For call centers, agencies reported an average of $800 million annually for call center obligations for fiscal years2014 through 2018, with HHS accounting for at least 80 percent of the total. Call center spending accounted for 0.2 percent of all federal spending during the 5 year period. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring that effective information security controls are put in place for information resources and assets that support federal operations and for ensuring the effective oversight of the security of the information. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for overseeing agency information security policies and practices. To implement FISMA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)—a component within the department of Commerce—developed standards and guidelines for agencies to use to help manage information security risks. The NIST framework emphasizes that an organization needs to develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services. To accomplish this goal an agency generally must be able to develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity, develop and implementation of appropriate safeguards, and restore system capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event. The five selected contracts included examples of various safeguards—such as limiting access to data systems and data, system management controls, contingency planning and restoration of services, and restrictions on the use of equipment—to protect data and personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and use. These safeguards are all part of NIST standards. For example, the GSA contract for the day-to-day operations for the DOD Information Network requires the contractor to assist the government to ensure that all networks and information systems are accredited in accordance with DOD's Certification and Accreditation Program, which requires certain cybersecurity protections are in place.
DOD's MTFs provide health care to active-duty servicemembers and other beneficiaries through TRICARE, a joint military and civilian health care program. Section 703 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD to develop an implementation plan for restructuring MTF. In February 2020, DOD submitted its Plan for MTF restructuring to Congress. The NDAA also included a provision for GAO to review DOD's implementation plan. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DOD's methodology for determining military medical treatment facility (MTF) restructuring actions in the Plan prioritized cross-cutting elements from 10 U.S.C. 1073d and considered complete information and (2) DOD has positioned itself to execute transition planning. GAO reviewed DOD's draft and final Plan, interviewed DOD officials, and reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 11 selected M TFs selected to represent a variety of characteristics, including a mix of hospitals and clinics from each military department, different recommendations for how they should be restructured, different conclusions about network adequacy, and urban and rural areas located in proximity to one another in terms of driving distance. The Department of Defense (DOD) 703 Work Group's (703) methodology was thoroughly documented and prioritized statutory elements, including support for military readiness, adequate nearby civilian care, and cost-effectiveness. However, the group based key parts of its methodology on some incomplete and inaccurate information. For example, it did not include complete and accurate information about the quality of civilian care available in the area, such as access to providers within standards for patients' drive time. DOD guidance states that beneficiaries should have a choice of health care providers that is sufficient to ensure access to appropriate, high-quality health care. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government require the use of quality information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and timely to inform decisions. Until DOD consistently captures and assesses information about health care quality and patients' access to such care, DOD leaders may not fully understand risks to the achievement of their objectives in restructuring future military treatment facilities. DOD has taken preliminary steps toward transition planning by identifying actions needed to facilitate the restructuring and MTF transitions, but it is not yet well positioned to execute these transitions. Through its section 703(d) Plan to Congress, DOD has identified actions that will be needed to facilitating restructuring. These actions include 17 recommendations for enterprise-wide changes across MTF, and various MTF-specific steps to mitigate risks at a local level. DOD's Plan also poses challenges for the military departments and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) related to medical provider readiness and staffing. DOD does not have a process for monitoring MTF restructuring transitions to address these challenges. MHS reform and the DHA's progress in achieving goals are longstanding challenges on which GAO has previously reported. In April 2012, GAO reported that DOD did not consistently employ key management practices in implementing initiatives to change its MHS governance structure and recommended that DOD implement a monitoring process across DOD's portfolio of initiatives for overseeing progress and identify accountable officials and their roles and responsibilities for all of its initiatives. DOD implemented this recommendation by assigning each initiative a working group, an initiative leader, and executive sponsor to help ensure that the initiative remained on schedule, on budget, and achieved performance goals. In November 2013 and later in September 2015 on DOD's progress on its progress in reforming the military health system (MHS), GAO identified deficiencies and made recommendations to provide decision makers with more complete information on its implementation, management, and oversight. DOD concurred with the 10 related recommendations and implemented all but one.
The Marine Corps manages the execution of its civilian personnel budget based on the dollar amount, not FTE workload forecasts, through an approach referred to as “Manage to Payroll.” Specifically, the approach places an emphasis on spending the amount of dollars or funding available for civilian personnel and not on executing a calculated full-time equivalent civilian personnel workload. GAO was asked to review the Marine Corps' approach to managing its civilian Personnel Budget Execution. This report examines (1) how the Corps develops its civilianpersonnel budget request, (2) the extent to which the Corps manages its civilianPersonnel budget execution, and (3) whether the Corps is consistently exceeding or falling below its FTE budget request at each major subordinate command. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed Marine Corps budget execution data from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, reviewed Marine Corps policies and procedures, and interviewed Marine Corps and Department of Defense (DOD) officials. The Marine Corps formulates its annual civilian personnel budgets using prior fiscal year data as a baseline, then makes adjustments for the upcoming fiscal year based on inputs from various sources like the Department of the Navy and Office of Management and Budget (OMB). GAO's review of Marine Corps civilian personnel data found that it does not match the civilian personnel FTE data DOD uses to formulate its annual budget request. Specifically, Marine Corps data maintained in its Standard Accounting, Budgeting, and Reporting System (SABRS), which tracks both dollar amount and FTE allotment across the major subordinate commands, is not consistent with the data provided in DOD's annual budget requests. GA OMB Circular A-11 requires that current year FTE estimates should be consistent with previous year actuals, should be fully funded, and should be very close to the actual usage reported at the end of the fiscal year. For example, the estimates in the previous year's budget should be close to actuals published in the current budget. Without updated guidance for the major commands to manage their respective civilian personnel to FTEs, the Corps risks overspending or underspending on its personnel requirements and may not have sufficient information to effectively and efficiently provide funding for its civilian workforce. The Corps is projected to spend $1,749,444,000 on civilian personnel for fiscal year 2019, which is in line with the $1.750,500,000 provided in its budget request for managing civilian personnel. However, four of the 15 major commands are either exceeding or not reaching their requested dollar amounts by $5 million dollars or more. Federal internal control standards state that management should document the organization's internal control responsibilities in its policies at the appropriate level of detail to allow management to monitor the control activity effectively. Additionally, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense's Comptroller is responsible for managing and reporting on DOD's civilian workforce and civilian personnel funding. Without accurate and complete civilian personnel workforce data, senior leaders in DOD and decision makers in Congress will not be able to make informed planning and spending decisions and may risk funding not accurately tracking with actual needs.
In fiscal year 2019, states are required to spend at least 8 percent of their Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) funding for “quality activities”—activities that are designed to improve the quality of child care services the state provides. These activities may include supporting the professional development of the child care workforce and improving the supply and quality of programs and services for infants and toddlers. In addition, states must spend 70 percent of discretionary funds that remain on subsidies for eligible families through the CCDF program in the form of certificates or vouchers to use for child care in homes, child care centers, and classrooms, or through grants or contracts to child care providers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, included a provision for GAO to review the use of CCDF funds for quality activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have used CCDF funding to support quality child care activities, (2) how states plan to spend the new funds, and (3) how CCDF quality activities affect children not receiving subsidies. GAO surveyed CCDF administrators in the 50 states and D.C. and interviewed CCDF officials in 15 states and the District of Columbia about their plans to spend new funds. The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. A majority of states reported using fiscal year 2017CCDF funds to entirely or mostly fund 7 of 10 major state child care programs and activities, according to GAO's survey of state Child Care Development Fund administrators. Among states that relied on CCDF to support the quality activities, GAO found that, on average, states funded 6 of the 10 activities entirely or Mostly with CCDF. Nearly one-third of states (16) funded at least eight of these 10 activities to that degree. States reported that they relied most frequently on funding from CCDF for three quality activities: child care resource and referral systems, consumer education, and health and safety standards establishment and training. For example, 40 of the 15 states GAO interviewed reported that all (22) or most (18) of the funding they used for their child care Resource and Referral System in 2017 came from CC DF. State officials described various ways in which these centers support providers and parents, such as providing training and technical assistance to providers and providing information on child care quality and child development, among other things. States also reported that a range of quality activities—consumer education, licensing, monitoring, and professional development— affect the care of nonsubsidized children (nonsubsidized children)—that is, children who do not receive subsidies but who may be eligible for them, or who are ineligible for them. For instance, states reported that more than 40 percent of the funds they used in 2017 for consumer education were used to help parents seeking child care make informed decisions and improve access to information that supports child development. In the absence of the new funding, officials from two states said they would likely need to reduce their efforts to better educate families statewide about important child development information and the states' publicly-available tools that can help parents identify high-quality child care.
The General Services Administration (GSA) leases space on behalf of federal agencies in 8,681 buildings or other assets and maintains a total inventory of more than 370 million square feet of workspace for 1.1 million federal employees, plus support contractors. GSA can delegate its leasing authority to agencies if GSA determines it is in the government's best interest. Agencies may request this delegation of authority when they believe they can obtain the lease more efficiently than GSA. In 2007, GAO found that GSA's delegated leasing program documentation was incomplete, inconsistent, unclear, and outdated. In 2014, GSA began using a new electronic system—G-REX—to review and process applications for delegations of leasing authority. GAO was asked to review the delegated leasing process. This report examines (1) the extent to which GSA has reformed its delegated lease delegation program since 2007 and (2) whether GSA knows if agencies have the policies and procedures to effectively manage their delegated leasing activities. To do this work, GA O reviewed GSA documents, interviewed GSA officials, and interviewed officials from four agencies with delegated leasing authority that were selected based on size, complexity, and number of leases awarded. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provided insights on GSAs delegated leasing programs. The General Service Administration has made efforts to reform its delegated leased authority program by clarifying requirements, documenting policies, and centralizing data management, but data quality issues persist. For example, in 2007, in response to GAO and GSA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reviews, the agency issued new requirements for the delegated lease program in the Federal Management Regulation Bulletin 2008-B1 (2008 Bulletin), which required agencies to have an organizational structure in place to support the delegation of lease authority, and to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and directives governing the lease acquisition. However, in 2014 GSA re-emphasized and updated the requirements applicable to GSA leasing delegations in its 2014 Bulletin, which continued to be in effect when this report was issued. In addition, the Office of Inspector General found that some delegated leases had excessive rental rates and inadequately documented lease files, primarily due to customer agencies lack of expertise. Further, 56 percent of the lease files reviewed by the OIG contained insufficient documentation to support that the federal government received a fair and reasonable price. In spite of its reform efforts, the GSA continues to address data quality problems that affect its ability to monitor its delegated leases. For instance, in 2015 GAO identified data errors that resulted in approved delegated leasing projects with annual rental rates that were 12 times higher than they should have been and lease terms that did not meet program requirements. In fiscal year 2018, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) did not submit required post award documents for delegated leases, which provide insight on final lease terms such as square footage, lease expiration date, and cost, which may differ from the acquisition plans agencies submitted when applying for delegated authority. As of November 2018, agencies submitted approximately one percent of delegated leases with post award documentation, according to data GAO reviewed. While GSA is taking steps to improve the new version of its delegated leasing system, it does not perform an annual reconciliation of data between two of its databases, which are used for different purposes. Specifically, the Federal Real Property Database (FRPP) is a single comprehensive database that contains information on federal real property worldwide, updated annually, and G-REx is considered a business process management software application and is primarily used by GSA to process and capture lease delegation applications, according To the extent practical, the two databases should be reconciled, but GSA does not have any plans to do so. As a result, it is missing oversight opportunities, such as finding leases with annual rent or terms that do not meet the program requirements, and it is operating at odds with its own procedures. The Standards for Internal Control in the federal Government state that improving the reliability of data could help agencies better manage programs. In this case, agencies could utilize real property data to measure performance and inform decision-making to ultimately improve the cost effectiveness and efficiency of their real property portfolio. In contrast, although FRPP data quality could be improved, FRPP can still provide reliable background information on its federal realproperty portfolio. Until GSA clarifies its position on what efforts it
The EAS program provides subsidized air service to 108 communities in the contiguous United States, as well as 65 in Alaska and Hawaii, when the Department of Transportation (DOT) determines that air service will not be provided without subsidy. The program is funded through a combination of annual appropriations and overflight fees collected from foreign aircraft traveling over U.S. airspace without taking off or landing in the United States. In fiscal year 2018, the program provided about $276 million in subsidies to EAS communities. Since 2010, DOT has made several changes to the program, such as increasing the subsidy-per-passenger cap from $200 to $1,000 and eliminating eligibility for communities that did not receive EAS between 2010 and 2011. GAO was asked to review the program. This report examines (1) changes in the number of communities that have received EAS since 2010, (2) the extent to which communities have lost eligibility for the program since 2010 and the reasons for this loss, and (3) the program's current challenges and options for reform. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and other documents and interviewed officials from DOT, 10 EAS carriers, and 17 communities that were eligible for EAS in fiscal years 2010 through 2018. DOT reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2010, four statutory changes and a change in DOT's enforcement policy have limited communities' eligibility to receive air service through the Essential Air Service (EAS) program. The Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 removed EAS eligibility for certain communities within 175 miles of a large- or medium-hub airport that do not have an average of at least 10 enplanements per day during the most recent fiscal year. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 and subsequent appropriations acts required the Secretary of Transportation to negotiate a local cost share with communities located less than 40 miles from the smallest hub airport before entering into a new contract using EAS subsidies. In October 2014, DOT issued a Notice of Enforcement Policy stating that it would start enforcing the annual subsidy cap of $200 for communities less than 210 miles from a medium- or large- hub airport after September 30, 2015. However, DOT may grant a waiver for a community that has not met the cap. As a result of these changes in statute and enforcement policy, 12 communities lost eligibility and either were not eligible for a waiver, did not apply for one, or applied for one and were not granted one from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2019 (see table). While some communities lost their eligibility, many others continue to receive the program because they were granted at least one waiver from DOT. From fiscal years 2014 through 2019, DOT granted a total of 110 waivers to 37 communities—about one-third of the communities currently in the program—because they experienced a hiatus in service during the year that resulted in the community's not meeting the 10 average daily enplanement requirement or exceeding the $200 subsidy per passenger cap. DOT granted waivers to 15 of the 37 communities because they had not met these requirements or exceeded the cap in the prior fiscal year, and granted a waiver to all but three of the remaining communities. DOT did not grant waivers to Hagerstown, MD, because of its proximity to a large hub airport and the fact that there was not sufficient evidence to indicate that the community would be able to meet eligibility requirements in the future. In September 2019, Franklin/Oil City filed a petition to DOT for reconsideration, but DOT denied the petition. In August 2019, Hagersstown filed a lawsuit to challenge DOT's decision in federal court. Some of the increased program expenditures were due to increased costs of certain critical resources over the last several years such as pilots' salaries. For example, in 2018 GAO found that compensation for commercial airline pilots has increased in recent years, most noticeably in new-hire compensation at regional airlines. DOT officials told GAO that some of the cost increase is related to factors that also affected the rest of the airline industry such as increased costs for pilots, flight crew, and mechanics. Stakeholders GAO interviewed cited a number of potential options for reforming the program to improve service to communities, but some of these options would likely result in increased program costs. These options include revising DOT's process for carrier selection and restructuring DOT's contracts with carriers to provide EAS service.
U.S. universities conduct research on items that may be subject to export control regulations, such as technology and software, to support the nation's national security and economic interests. GAO was asked to review universities' compliance with export controls. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Departments of State and Commerce have provided guidance and outreach that supports universities' understanding of and compliance with both agencies' export controls, (2) export control-related challenges that U. S. universities face while working with or obtaining guidance from other federal agencies, and (3) universities' export control compliance policies and practices. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency guidance and interviewed officials at nine universities selected on the basis of a number of factors, including total research and development expenditures, number of graduate students, and research funding received from certain federal agencies. The nine universities GAO visited have generally developed export compliance programs to safeguard export-controlled items that align with the Department of State's (State) and Department of Commerce's (Commerce) export compliance guidelines, but some of the universities' efforts have weaknesses in certain areas. For example, some universities do not conduct risk assessments to assess and identify potential risks in their compliance programs, which may limit their ability to identify potential threats or build safeguards in their programs to address potential risks. In addition, four of the nine universities have not developed an export compliance manual, which is a key element of an effective compliance program. State's Defense Trade Controls Directorate (DDTC) and Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) provide some guidance and conduct outreach to universities, but university officials told GAO that this guidance does not adequately address university-specific issues and that more outreach is needed. University and association officials GAO interviewed identified challenges working with and obtaining guidance on export controls and foreign threats from federal agencies that fund research and monitor threats to the United States, including threats to research security. Specifically, university officials stated that federal agencies are developing different requirements for reporting financial conflicts of interest to address foreign influence issues, some agencies provide briefings and other forms of guidance related to export controls that do not sufficiently address universities' needs, and DOD officials inconsistently interpret export controls regulations and misunderstand what constitutes fundamental research. Agencies are taking steps to address some of these challenges, including an interagency working group established by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. However, the actions that DOD plans to take to address agency officials' inconsistent interpretation of the regulations and their misunderstanding of the term fundamental research may not fully address the challenge identified by university officials. Without additional efforts to educate all relevant DOD officials on a clear and common understanding of the relevant statutes, regulations, and policies, as identified by the department's 2010 memorandum, universities may continue to perceive DOD officials as inconsistently interpreting the regulations.
The federal government transfers risk or losses from adverse events to the federal government through a wide range of activities, including federal insurance programs, loan guarantees, senior preferred stock purchase agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, federal employee and veterans benefits, and other activities. GAO was asked to review federal activities that transfer risks or losses to the government. In this report, GAO (1) identifies federal insurance activities and, where possible, identifies cost- and exposure-related information on these activities; and (2) uses selected activities to illustrate some of the challenges that GAO has identified in past reports with measuring and reporting fiscal exposures in budget documents. To do this work GAO updated its 2005 catalog of federal insurance and other federal activities by reviewing the Financial Report of the United States Government, the President's Budget, the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, and the U.S. Code, and interviewed agency officials. The federal government's primarily cash-based budget may not accurately reflect the costs the government incurs and the payments the government may be expected to make for some activities, such as federal loan guarantees and federal employee benefits. For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (PBGC) single-employer and multiemployer pension insurance programs have been able to pay all guaranteed benefits and financial assistance to date, but PBGC forecasts a very high likelihood of insolvency in the next several years if there are no changes in law. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and National Credit Union Administration's (NCUA) share insurance programs also differ in their expected ability to cover future losses. According to FEMA, as currently designed, NFIP likely will not have enough funds to cover all future program expected losses, and NFIP also would not be able to cover a single super-catastrophic year, in which NFIP could experience as much as $40 billion in claims, according to FEMA. PBGC is expected to fund itself entirely through premiums, other nonfederal assets and income (such as investment income), and assets from underfunded, terminated single- employer plans it takes over, as it currently does not receive taxpayer funds and does not have authority to borrow funds from the Treasury. In contrast, NCUA's Share Insurance Fund borrowed funds from Treasury during the 2007–2009 financial crisis but has since repaid the loans. GA OMB and Treasury had no comments on a draft of this report. The agencies provided technical comments that were incorporated as appropriate. Federal loan guarantees are any guarantees, insurance, or other pledges with respect to the payment of all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt obligation of a non-federal borrower to anonfederal lender. Thus, the federal guarantee transfers some or all of the risks of borrower default from private lenders to theFederal government. The Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Financial Report and related note disclosures show that as of September 30, 2017, federal loan guarantee liabilities were $12.5 billion. This was largely attributable to guarantees under Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the largest of which is FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) program. The program provides mortgage insurance to encourage lenders to make credit available to borrowers not adequately served by the conventional market, suchAs first-time homebuyers, minorities, and lower-income families. Similarly, FHA loan guarantees accounted for about 48 percent of all FHA guarantee liabilities as of December 31, 2018. Federal employee and veteran benefit activities transfer at least some risk or loss to the Federal Government. These activities can be broadly categorized into those that provide compensation for property or financial losses—including losses resulting from adverse environmental or manmade events—and those that offer life, health, or disability benefits to nonf federal employees. The majority of the 95 activities GAO identified that transferred risk or Losses to the Government for fiscal year 2017 were related to federal employee or veterans benefits. The extent of the government's legal commitment for some of these activities may not be evident in the budget, because the primarily cash based budget generally records spending only when payments are made. However, some activities have a combination of explicit and implicit fiscal exposures, which may be difficult to measure because of the complexity and uncertainty surrounding some exposures. For instance, PBGC's annual receipts exceeded its outlays by $4.8 billion
In fiscal year 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had 2,964 full-time, permanent, career employees in its Civil and Foreign Services, according to National Finance Center data. GAO was asked to review workforce diversity at USAID. This report examines (1) the demographic composition of USAID's workforce in fiscal years 2002 through 2018, (2) differences in promotion outcomes for racial or ethnic groups in the Civil Service and Foreign Service, (3) differences for men and women in the workforce, and (4) the extent to which USAID has identified workforce diversity issues and worked to address them. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed USAID workforce data for fiscal years 2018 and 2002-2018, reviewed agency documents, and interviewed agency officials and representatives of 13 employee groups representing current employees in the civil and foreign services. In fiscal year 2002, the proportion of racial orethnic minorities among USAIDs full- time, permanent career employees was 33 percent. In comparison, in fiscal year 2017, the most recent available data, this proportion was 37 percent. The proportion of minorities in the federal workforce increased from 31 percent in 2002 to 37 percent in 2017. In contrast, the percentage of African Americans in USAID’s Civil Service decreased from 42 percent to 32 percent over the same period, while the proportion in the Foreign Service increased from 11 percent to 12 percent. From fiscal years 2006 through 2010 (the most recent data available), GAO found that racial and ethnic minority representation in the relevant civilian labor force for USAID was higher for officials and managers, professional workers, and technical workers and technologists than for other occupational groups. In addition, racial or ethnicity minorities had lower odds of promotion than whites in early to mid career (Class 4 through Class 1), but these differences were generally not statistically significant when GAO controlled for certain individual and occupational factors other than gender that could influence promotion, such as age and years of government service. However, these findings do not completely explain the reasons for these differences, which may result from various unobservable factors. For example, the average percentage of women promoted from GS-11 through GS-13 was lower for women than for men, but GAO could not conclude that there was a statistical relationship between gender and promotion from these ranks. The agency has identified underrepresentation of specific groups in its workforce but has not carried out required equal employment opportunity (EEO) activities. In each of its annual reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), USAID identified the following groups as being underrepresented: Hispanic males and females; people with targeted disabilities; and Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics in certain major occupations in areas such as health, contracting, program or project development, auditing, and management and program analysis. According to USAID officials, these groups remain underrepresented. In its June 2016 Human Resource Transformation Strategy and Action Plan, as well as its 2017 Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan, USAID outlined planned efforts to support diversity and inclusion. Staffing gaps have prevented USAID from responding to EEO complaints within mandated timeframes, analyzing its workforce for trends and potential barriers to equal employment, and completing annual reports on the agency's diversity efforts. In response to EEOC instructions to federal agencies, model EEO programs must have sufficient budget and staffing to, among other things, conduct self-assessments of possible program deficiencies and conduct thorough barrier analyses of their agency's workforce. Although USAID reported that it has previously completed barrier analyses, the agency reported insufficient personnel resources to conduct annual agency self-analyses for its fiscal years 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2017 submissions. Further, EEOC officials expressed concern regarding OCRD's lack of capacity to analyze and address diversity issues. Without the capacity to consistently perform these functions,USAID risks being unable to achieve its goal of a diverse and inclusive workforce environment. USAID is also unable to consistently submit required annual MD-715 reports on its diversity efforts, which are due by February 28 following the end of the fiscal year that is being reported, although EEOC has the discretion to grant extensions. EEOC requires federal agencies to submit these reports annually, but USAID did not submit a report for fiscal year2018 and has not submitted a report since 2013. In November 2019, officials told GAO that the Office of Civil Rights and Diversity lacked the staff needed to complete the
The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) requires executive branch agencies, among other things, to (1) review all programs and activities and identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments (commonly referred to as conducting a risk assessment), (2) publish improper payment estimates, (3) implement corrective actions to reduce improper payments and set reduction targets, and (4) report on the results of addressing the foregoing requirements. IPERA also requires executive agencies' IGs to annually determine and report on whether their respective agencies complied with six IPERA-related criteria. If an agency does not meet one or more of the six criteria for any of its programs or activities, the IG considers the agency to be noncompliant overall. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' compliance with IPERA for fiscal year 2018. This report examines the extent to which the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies were reported as compliant with the IPERA criteria for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. To do this work, GAO reviewed agency financial reports, interviewed agency IGs, and analyzed reported improper payment data for fiscal Years 2019 and 2018. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) reviewed a draft of this report and had no comments. The remaining agencies and IG offices informed GAO that they had no comment. Eight years after the implementation of IPERA, half of the 24 CFO Act agencies—the Departments of Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and Related Agencies, and the Treasury—were reported by their inspectors general (IG) to be compliant with six of the act's criteria in fiscal year (FY) 2018. Specifically, IGs reported that agencies were compliant for FY 2018 with the requirement to conduct program-specific risk assessments if it was applicable to the agency. In addition, 22 of 24 agencies (92 percent) met the requirement that agencies publish a financial report in the form and including all content required by OMB—typically an AFR or a PAR—for the most recent fiscal year, and post that report on their websites. Agencies were most frequently reported asnoncompliant with the FY 2018 requirement to publish and meet annual targets for improper payment reduction. Of the 14 agencies for which this requirement was applicable, 8 agencies (57 percent) and 5 agencies (33 percent) reported that their agencies were non Compliant. The second most-frequently reported area of noncompliance related to the FY2018 requirement for agencies' reported improper payments to be below 10 percent for programs that published estimates. Of these 15 agencies forwhich this requirement is applicable, 5 agencies and 5 IG offices reported that the agencies were Noncompliant. For FY 2018, 12 of 24 IGs for these 24 agencies reported their agency was compliant with overall IPERA overall. This is an increase from the 10 agencies reported as compliance for FY 2017. The improvement in IPERA compliance is attributable to two agencies—Commerce and Education—that were reported by IGs as noncompl compliant in FY 2017 but compliant in 2018. Improper payment estimates for Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) totaled about $36 billion and $18 billion, respectively, in FY 2018 and FY 2019. The federal government's ability to understand the full scope of its improper payments is hindered by incomplete, unreliable, or understated estimates, risk assessments that may not accurately assess the risk of improper payment, and noncompliance with criteria listed in the act. For example, certain agencies did not report estimates of improper payments for FY 2019 for the Premium Tax Credit and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs, and as GAO previously reported, the Department of Defense (DOD) lacks quality assurance procedures to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the payment populations from which it develops improper payments estimates.
The F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, is DOD's most costly and ambitious aircraft acquisition, costing an estimated $400 billion to develop and procure 2,457 aircraft over the next 35 years. The program has been restructured three times since 2001 with revised cost and schedule estimates. The most recent restructuring was initiated in 2010 when the program's cost estimates exceeded certain thresholds established by statute--a condition known as a critical Nunn-McCurdy breach. DOD subsequently certified to Congress in June 2010 that the program was essential to national security and needed to continue. DOD then established a new acquisition program baseline in 2012 that added $162.7 billion to the programs cost estimate and extended the original delivery schedule by 5-6 years. GAO was asked to review the program annually until the program reaches full-rate production. This is the fourth report under that mandate. In this report, GAO (1) provides information on progress toward completing testing of the baseline aircraft; (2) assesses current reliability and maintainability (R&M) status; (3) evaluates modernization efforts to add new aircraft capabilities known as Block 4; and (4) provides data on production costs and efficiency initiatives. To address these objectives, we reviewed program documents, interviewed DOD and contractor officials, and conducted fieldwork in Washington, D.C., and New York. The Department of Defense (DOD) has made slow, sustained progress in improving the F-22 Raptor aircraftthe baseline aircraft the program is developing to replace aging aircraft in the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navyand is now in the process of completing development of Block 4, which is expected to cost about $10.5 billion. The baseline aircraft development program was complete in April 2018, when developmental testing concluded. As GAO reported in June 2018, the program office reported it had met all nine of its capability thresholds and delivered three of those nine capabilities. However, it has to complete operational testing before DOD can determine if the six remaining capabilities have been delivered. The purpose of operational testing is to assess the effectiveness, suitability, survivability, lethality, and mission capability, including the information systems and the air vehicle, in an operationally representative environment. Operational testing includes cyber security assessments, some of which have been conducted. In December 2018, after a 3-month delay, operational testing began. This testing was delayed for two main reasons. First, before the program could begin operational testing, it had to resolve critical deficiencies with the aircraft that were identified during development testing. Second, to accommodate an unexpected grounding following the crash of an F-B in September 2018. According to a test official, program officials expect to complete testing in December 2019, about three months later than planned due to delays with the simulator that is used for more complex testing. The F- 35 program is still not meeting all of its R&M targets. All aircraft variants are generally performing near or above targets for half of the R& M metrics, but four of the eight metrics are still falling short. While the program has not taken adequate steps to ensure the targets for the others will be met, it is still accountable for ensuring those targets are met. For example, while DOD has an action plan to improve R & M performance, its guidance does not define specific, measurable objectives for what the desired goals for the F&M performance should be or align improvement projects with these goals. Program officials stated that they are considering revising the program guidance to include more specific objectives, but have not yet taken actions to do so. Without defining measurable objectives and aligning which improvement projects will ensure those metrics are met and prioritizing funding for improving R &M, projects may continue to be either prematurely suspended or never get underway. As a result, the warfighter may accept aircraft that are less reliable than originally described and have operation and sustainment costs that may raise affordability questions. With the baseline program complete and early development and testing under way for Block 4 at an estimated cost of about $9.5 to $10 billion, DOD is transitioning to early Block 4 modernization efforts before completing a business case—a baseline estimate to track program performance going forward. In doing so, DOD will commit resources to Block 4 without adequate knowledge of its full cost, schedule, and level of technology maturity, putting the program at risk of experiencing cost overruns similar to those experienced during its baseline development.
Medicare-dependent hospitals (MDHs) are eligible to receive additional payments under the program if they meet certain criteria, such as having at least 60 percent of their inpatient days or discharges attributed to Medicare beneficiaries. GAO was asked to examine the relationship between MDHs and Medicare dependence. This report examines (1) how the MDH designation differs from the other Medicare rural hospital designations, (2) changes in the number and selected metrics of MDhs and other hospital types, and (3) the extent to which hospitals' bed size and rural status are associated with the Medicare dependence measures. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed CMS data for fiscal years 2011 through 2017, the most recent year for which complete data were available, and interviewed CMS officials. The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Medicare-dependent hospital designation differs in terms of eligibility criteria, financial benefit, legislative permanence, relative size, and overlap with other rural hospital payment designations. To qualify as an MDH, a hospital must demonstrate that it is: Medicare- dependent, defined as having a 60 percent Medicare share of its inpatient day or discharge attributable to beneficiaries; small,defined as having 100 or fewer beds; and rural, meaning that the hospital is located in a rural area, though hospitals can also be eligible if they are in a state without any rural areas. In addition, hospitals are eligible for additional payments based on their historic reported inpatient operating costs, trended forward to adjust for inflation and other factors, from one of three years (1982, 1987, or 2002). If the payment based on the hospital-specific rate (HSR) is higher than what the hospital would have otherwise received under the Medicare prospective payment system (IPPS), the hospital receives an additional payment. In this case, the additional payment is calculated as 75 percent of the difference between the HSR and the IPPS amount. In contrast, hospitals with the lowest HSR would receive no additional payment under IPPS. The Rural Referral Center (RRC) and Critical Access Hospital (CAH) designations have both inpatient and outpatient payment benefits. The sole community hospitals (SCH) and low-volume adjustment hospitals (LVA) have no inpatient or outpatient payment benefit. The MDH program is a temporary program and must be extended periodically by Congress in order to continue. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included a provision to extend the program through fiscal year 2022. The only other designation that must be extend is the LVA designation, which was temporarily expanded by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 to include hospitals with a higher volume of discharges and located closer to other hospitals than in previous years. These expanded eligibility criteria have been extended through 2022, but if Congress does not extend the expanded criteria beyond 2022, they will return to the narrower eligibility criteria that were in place prior to the act. The number of rural hospitals with each designation declined from 193 in fiscal year 2011 to 138 in 2017—a 28 percent decrease—and the number of hospitals receiving an additional annual payment declined by 15 percent from 92 in fiscalyear 2011 to 78 in 2017. The amount received and the share of the hospital's total revenue this payment represented varied widely across the years, though the average amount generally increased over time. For example, one hospital received around $1,000 in additional payment while another received almost $10.5 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2011, while the median additional payment increased from about $695,000 to about $812,000 over the same time period. The share of inpatient revenue that came from inpatient services decreased from 66 percent in 2011 to 58 percent in 2017, and the average share of total facility revenue decreased from 25 percent to 22 percent. The average additional payment ranged from less than 0.1 percent up to 8.7 percent of facility revenue, with a fairly consistent average of 1.2 to 1.6 percent. This underscores that the additional payments can be small relative to the overall revenue that a hospital receives. The percentage of total revenue that hospitals receive from Medicare and other payers is a measure of Medicare dependence, which is the percentage of revenue that is attributable to inpatient care provided to beneficiaries.
DOD and civilian agencies use the LPTA process to competitively award contracts and orders valued at $5 million or more in fiscal year 2018. DOD and the five selected civilian agencies are required to use the process to the maximum extent practicable to acquire certain products and services. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision that GAO report on the number of instances where civilian agencies used the process, as well as an explanation of how acquisition officials considered the criteria in making a determination to use it. This report describes (1) the status of regulatory changes required by the defense and civilian provisions for using the process and (2) the extent to which DOD and selected civilian agency agencies used this process to compete for competitively awarded contracts and order valued at more than $5million in 2018, and what they bought using this process. GAO analyzed data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to identify the population of DOD and civilian agency contracts and ordered that were reported as competitively awards and valued at at least $5m in 2018 and reviewed two generalizable random samples of these contracts. The Department of Defense (DOD) and five civilian agencies GAO reviewed—the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and Agriculture (USDA), and the General Services Administration (GSA)—used the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) process for about 25 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of such contracts and Orders valued at over $5.5 million in 2018. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and the Federal Acquisition regulation (FAR) do not currently address the limitations on the use of LPTA for services that could be considered within the categories for which the provisions place limitations on, but do not prohibit, use of the process. In November 2018, GAO found that DOD contracting officers generally justified the use and justification for using LPTA in these categories. In December 2018, DOD issued a proposed rule to revise the DFARS and FAR to address the defense provisions. DOD expects to finalize the rule by the end of fiscal year 2019. The FAR Council has also initiated efforts to incorporate the civilian provisions into the FAR. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal year 2019 required that the FAR be revised to incorporate these civilian provisions within 120 days after enactment, which would have been in December 2018. Officials from the Office of Federal Procures Policy told GAO that it generally takes much longer than 120 days to revised the FAR, however, according to an analysis provided by DOD, it takes 483 days on average to issue a FAR rule. DOD officials stated that a proposed FAR rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register in September 2019. In addition, the Defense Pricing and Contracting Office (DPO) is in the process of revising and finalizing a final DFARS rule, which is expected to be issued in July 2019. DOD has stated that it can take up to a year or longer to develop and finalize a final rule. The DFARS revisions have been delayed for several reasons, including the need to address LPTA-related provisions in two separate NDAAs and to resolve a backlog of DFARS changes. DOD also plans to update its DFARS Procedures, Guidance and Information to provide defense contracting officers with supplemental guidance on applying the new criteria for applying theLPTA process.
The military justice system provides avenues for accused servicemembers to raise allegations of discrimination, improprieties in the selection of the military jury at the court-martial proceeding, before a judge, and on appellate review. GAO was asked to review issues related to racial disparities in military justice. This report examines (1) the extent to which the military services collect, maintain, and report consistent information about race and ethnicity in their investigations, military justice, and personnel databases, and (2) what is known about racial disparities that may exist in the military justice process. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and procedures; analyzed data from the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, and the Department of Homeland Security; and interviewed cognizant officials. The military services do not collect and maintain consistent information regarding race andethnicity in their investigation, court-Martial, or personnel databases. For example, the number of potential responses for race ranges from 5 to 32 options for race and 2 to 25 options for ethnicity, which can complicate cross-service assessments. Although the data collected and maintained was not consistent within and across the services, each of the services' databases maintained data for at least 99 percent of the servicemember's race. The Coast Guard did not track race or ethnicity in its military justice database, Law Manager. Coast Guard officials stated that this is because Law Manager was designed to determine the status of court- martial cases, and captures attributes that are needed to generate relevant documents, such as court pleadings. Demographic information such as race is not included in these official documents, so this information is not input into Law Manager, which limits the military's ability to collectively or comparatively assess these demographic data to identify any racial or ethnic disparities in theMilitary Justice System. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the services have taken some steps to study racial disparities over the last several decades, but they have not comprehensively studied the causes of any disparities. In a May 2019 report (GAO-2019-10-842 ), GAO recommended that the Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with the military service Secretaries and Homeland Security Secretaries, conduct an evaluation to identify the causes and take steps to address the causes. DOD partially concurred with this recommendation. In December 2019, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 included a provision directing DOD to conduct this evaluation by June 2020. Racial disparities exist in investigations, disciplinary actions, and case outcomes in the U.S. military justice systems, but GAO found that few statistically significant racial disparities existed in case outcomes—convictions and punishment severity—for general and special courts-martials. Specifically, in the Army and Navy, there were no statistically significant differences regarding the likelihood of conviction among racial groups, while controlling for other attributes, for general andspecial courts-Martials in the Navy and Air Force. In contrast, in all of the other military services GAO analyzed, there was no statisticallysignificant difference in the likelihood that Black servicemEMbers were convicted or received a more severe punishment in general or special courtsmartial compared to White servicEMembers. The Army and the Navy did not maintain complete data on nonjudicial punishment cases in their military justice databases, which limited their visibility into the vast majority of legal punishments imposed on servicers under the UCMJ every year. The Air Force and the Army did not have complete punishment data for all nonjudicial punishments, and GAO could not determine whether disparities existed because the services did not collect such data in their databases. As a result, these services are limited in their ability to assess or identify disparities among populations subject to this type of punishment. In May 2019 , GAO made four recommendations to the military departments and the Secretary for Homeland Security to develop the capability to present data on race, ethnicity, gender, offense, and punishment imposed for nonjudicial punishments. As of October 2019, officials from each military department said that they were working to implement these recommendations and expected to implement them by December 2020.
The federal government invests billions of dollars annually in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, which is critical to the nation's health and economic well-being. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to enhance the resilience of these infrastructure systems to climate change. This report examines (1) the potential impacts of climate change and the effects of these impacts on these systems; (2) technical assistance selected federal agencies provided to selected utilities to help make these systems more resilient, and options experts identified for providing additional technical assistance to utilities; and (3) financial assistance federal agencies have provided to help these utilities make their infrastructure more resilient to climate changes and options for additional financial assistance. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and planning guidance; analyzed federal disaster recovery and financial assistance data for fiscal years 2011 through 2018; interviewed federal officials and experts; and interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 15 utilities selected to obtain variation in their size and climate region to capture similarities and differences among utilities. Projected increases in the frequency, severity, and duration of extreme temperature changes or precipitation events, as well as rising sea levels, are among the potential climate change impacts that may affect drinking water or wastewater infrastructure. The type and severity of these potential impacts will vary by region. For example, in the Southwest, increased duration and intensity of drought may stress water supplies and increase water demand for agricultural uses. In the Northwest, increased water temperatures may degrade drinking water quality from higher levels of harmful toxins and algal blooms and require drinking water utilities to develop increased treatment capabilities. In addition, projected sea level rise can lead to saltwater intrusion in coastal groundwater aquifers and in estuaries. This may degrade water quality and increase treatment costs for drinking water treatment facilities or require new desalination facilities to treat water supplies with higher salt content. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Creating Resilient Water Utilities initiative (CRWU) is designed to provide drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater utilities with the practical tools, resources, training, and technical assistance needed to increase resilience to extreme weather events. The initiative provides web-based tools and resources in the form of an interactive guide, a case studies map, a risk assessment tool, and climate scenario projection maps to help utilities understand potential long-term risks and options to enhance their resilience to climate impacts. However, the 15 selected utilities GAO interviewed used a mix of sources, including other federal programs, to obtain technical assistance with understanding climate impacts and designing resilient infrastructure. To provide further technical assistance for climate resilience, selected experts generally supported the option of developing a coordinated network of technical assistance providers, including federal and state agencies, universities, consultants, and industry groups. The four federal agencies in GAO's review have nine programs that provide broad financial assistance, through loans or grants, for water infrastructure projects, but do not have selection criteria or requirements for utilities to incorporate climate resilience in the planning and design of projects that receive federal assistance. EPA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have taken some actions to promote climate resilience when providing financial assistance for projects, such as requiring utilities to complete planning and vulnerability assessments for natural disasters. According to EPA, FEMA, HUD, and USDA officials, utilities can use financial assistance from their programs to pay for projects that, in addition to other benefits, can help enhance climate resilience. GAOs' review of selected utilities' use of federal financial assistance found that most utilities relied on other sources of funding such as municipal bonds and funds raised primarily through user rates and fees for infrastructure projects to enhance resilience, but some utilities reported using selected federal programs to help fund projects that enhanced their climate resilience for FY 2011 through FY 2018. For instance, one utility used FEMA's Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation grants to relocate a flood-prone wastewater treatment facility after Hurricane Harvey in 2017 to increase the utility's resilience to floods and extreme storm events, and another utility received an EPA Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act loan to build a new recycled wastewater facility that will provide an additional source of drinking water to reduce the need for water imported from the Colorado River Basin, according to selected utility representatives. The remaining utilities used other funding sources such as state revolving funds, municipal bonds, and user fees to enhance climate resilient infrastructure projects for FY 2010 through FY
USPS is one of the largest civilian employers in the United States. In fiscal year 2018, USPS reported that it employed approximately 634,000 people and retirement benefits were paid to over 600,000 retirees and their survivors. USPS costs are concentrated in employee compensation, which accounted for approximately 72 percent of total operational costs in fiscal year2018. GAO was asked to review USPS's employee compensation costs. This report examines (1) the extent to which USPS's compensation costs have changed since 2009, (2) the results of recent actions taken by USPS to manage compensation costs, and (3) the potential effects of potential legislative changes to USPS employee compensation. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed USPS payroll data for fiscal years 2009 through 2018, reviewed USPS documents, and interviewed USPS officials. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) reported that compensation costs for current employees in 2018 were about $9 billion less than in 2009, when adjusted for inflation. However, most costs decreased between fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2014, and costs have generally risen since. For example, in 2014, USPS estimated that it would save $1.8 billion in compensation costs by reducing the number of employees by about 77,000 over this period. USPS has reported an anticipated total compensation cost increase for fiscal year 2019. Although USPS decreased compensation costs paid to current workers, its unfunded liabilities for retirement benefits significantly increased during the same time period. By law, USPS employees are entitled to participate in the federal retirement health benefits and pension programs. USPS is required to make annual payments into the Office of Personnel Management administered pension and retiree health benefits funds that support postal employee retirement benefits; however, USPS has failed to make a significant portion of these payments. For fiscal years 2017 and 2018, OPM billed USPS for required payments to the fund of $3.3 billion and $4.7 billion respectively and USPS did not make either payment. USPS also missed payments on an additional $33.9 billion in required payments for 2012-2016. In addition, as of September 30, 2018, the Postal Service had not contributed to its share of premiums for retired postal employee health care coverage. USPS reported an unfunding liability of about $66.5 billion for retiree retiree medical and health care benefits as of the end of fiscal year 2017, and about $110 billion for pension and health benefits for current and future retirees. USPS's efforts to decrease employee compensation have resulted in savings, but USPS has not fully assessed savings and other costs related to employee compensation and has not achieved financial sustainability. In 2010, USPS negotiated a lower starting pay rate for new career employees and reduced health insurance premiums for active employees. USPS estimated savings of $8.2 billion in fiscal years 2016 through 2018 from these changes, but GAO's analysis found that USPS likely saved about $6.6 billion. USPS overestimated its cost savings from the employee compensation changes because it did not include significant factors such as tenure and mix of work hours when developing its estimates. USPS officials said it was not necessary to factor in work hours because lower-paid employees were not introduced to work more hours, and USPS management officials told GAO that employees cannot opt into working more hours because overtime hours are assigned as necessary by supervisors. USPS does not have guidance for how to develop these estimates, including what significant factors should be considered. Given that USPS regularly evaluates and manages employee compensation in its labor negotiation, as well as overall budget planning, without guidance on what factors are necessary to consider when developing employee compensation cost estimates, USPS risks making ill-informed decisions about whether to maintain, or make additional, changes to compensation. USPS could further reduce costs by changing the frequency of its deliveries, which is a major driver of USPS's operating costs, by reducing mail carrier work hours. USPS currently delivers mail to nearly every mailing address, regardless of volume, six days per week. Reducing delivery by one day could potentially reduce mail carrier hours by a maximum of one sixth—or 16.7 percent—which could save up to $2.6 million per year.
NNSA uses SSCs to perform a variety of functions, such as program management and technical assistance, to meet its mission requirements. In fiscal years 2010 through 2018, NNSA obligated about $193 million for SSCS. GAO was asked to review NNSA's use of its SSC. This report examines the extent to which (1) NNSA used professional support service contracts (SSC), (2) the SSC information in its annual congressional budget justification materials is complete and useful to support congressional decision-making, and (3) the agency manages the potential risks of SSC that it determines are at high risk for providing inherently governmental functions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed NNSA data for fiscal years 2018 through 2020, reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 12 contracts, and interviewed NNSA and contractor officials. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) increasingly used its professional support services contracts ( SSC)—contracts for activities such as technical assistance and engineering and technical services—in recent years, primarily because of increased appropriations and workload and a decrease in authorized federal staff, according to GAO's analysis of data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). For example, from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2018, the number of federal full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in NNSA offices funded through the Federal Salaries and Expenses appropriations account decreased from 1,897 to 1,608, a decrease of 15 percent. In contrast, appropriations for the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation appropriations account increased from $6.4 billion to $10.6 billion during the same time period. NNSA reported information on its professional SSC in its fiscal years 2017 through 2020 annual congressional budgets justification materials, but the information was not complete because NNSA did not include data on all professional and contractor personnel who worked under an SSC for more than 2 years, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2016. Additionally, some of the information in the materials was not fully useful because it did not present the cost of the contracts in terms of obligations for 1 fiscal year and did not identify the specific appropriations accounts used to fund the contracts. By reporting information in this way, the cost data are not consistent across contracts and are not consistently with other information presented in the budget justification. NSA may not be effectively managing the risks of contracting for functions that can be considered to be inherently governmental. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) lists awarding contracts and administering contracts as two examples of functions that could be considered inherently governmental, but NNSA identified 37 of its 166 professional SSPs as closely associated with inherently governmental function and 4 contracts as related to critical function in its input to the Department of Energy's (DOE) annual service contract inventory analysis. The FAR also lists the conduct of foreign relations and the determination of foreign policy as inherently governmental activities. The purpose of the determination form is to mitigate the risk of awarding a contract that includes such functions. However, the determination forms do not require contracting officers to document the steps that they plan to take to oversee specific contracts, including those that the agency determined carry a risk for the performance of such functions, and NNSA does not have a process to verify that contracting officers are performing planned oversight for contracts that NNSA has identified as more likely to have the potential to include such functions throughout the life of the contract. By taking steps to document and verify that the contracting officer has implemented the planned oversight steps for contracts with a high risk of including inherently governmentalfunction, NSA would have better assurance that planned oversight was being carried out. Taking these actions could also help NNSA better ensure that the oversight steps continue, even if the oversight official changes during the contract's life.
In April 2018, Facebook disclosed that a Cambridge University researcher may have improperly shared the data of up to 87 million of Facebook's users with a political consulting firm. This followed other incidents in recent years involving the misuse of consumers' personal information from the Internet, which about three-quarters of Americans use. These types of incidents have raised public concern because Internet-based services and products, which are essential for everyday social and economic purposes, often collect and use various forms of personal information that could cause users harm if released. The federal privacy framework for private-sector companies is comprised of a set of tailored laws that govern the use and protection of personal data for specific purposes, in certain situations, or by certain sectors or types of entities. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is primarily a law enforcement agency with authority to, among other things, address consumer concerns about Internet privacy, both for Internet service providers and content providers. It does so using its general authority under section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” In January 2019, GAO reported on FTC's role and authorities for overseeing Internet privacy. This testimony is based on GAO's January 2019 report on Internet privacy (GAO-2019-11-854). It addresses (1) the role of FTC in overseeing consumer privacy, (2) recent data breaches involving personally identifiable information, and (3) opportunities for enhancing federal Internet privacy oversight. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and agency documents, and interviewed FTC officials and other stakeholders. Recent data breaches at federal agencies, retailers, hospitals, insurance companies, consumer reporting agencies, and other large organizations highlight the importance of ensuring the security and privacy of personally identifiable data collected and maintained by those entities. Such breaches have resulted in the potential compromise of millions of Americans' personally identifying information, which could lead to identity theft and other serious consequences. For example, the breach of an Equifax online dispute portal from May to July 2017 resulted in a compromise of records containing the personally identifiable Information of at least 145.5 million consumers in the United States and nearly 1 million consumers outside the United states. GA O reported in August 2018 that Equifax's investigation of the breach identified four major factors—identification, detection, segmenting of access to databases, and data governance—that allowed the attacker to gain access to its network and extract information from databases containing personally identifiableinformation. In September 2017, FTC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which both have regulatory and enforcement authority over consumer reporting agency such as Equifax, initiated an investigation into the breach and Equifax’s response. Their investigation is ongoing. Although FTC has been addressing Internet privacy through its unfair and deceptive practices authority and FTC and other agencies have been addressing this issue using statutes that target specific industries or consumer segments, the lack of a comprehensive federal privacy statute leaves consumers' privacy at risk. Comprehensive legislation that establishes specific standards and includes notice-and-comment rulemaking and first-time violation civil penalty authorities could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy and provide more certainty in the marketplace as companies innovate and develop new products using consumer data, and provide better assurance to consumers that their privacy will be protected.
Consumer reporting agencies (CRA) are companies that regularly assemble or evaluate consumer information for the purpose of providing consumer reports to third parties, such as banks, credit card companies, and employers. CRAs obtain consumer information from a wide variety of sources, including data furnishers (companies that report consumer information to CRAs) and public records. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) requires GAO to review the oversight of CRAs and furnishers. This report (1) describes the current oversight framework for CRAs, (2) examines how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has overseen them, (3) examines other federal agencies' oversight, and (4) identifies what is known about the causes of inaccuracies in consumer reports and processes in place to help ensure accuracy. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; interviewed staff from CFPB, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the prudential regulators (the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency), and five states; and interviewed stakeholders, including representatives from three nationwide and four smaller or specialty CRAs. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) of 1970 and its implementing regulation, Regulation V, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), as well as FTC's Furnisher Rule, are the primary federal laws governing the consumer reporting market. These laws govern the accuracy, security, use, and sharing of consumer report information. However, consumers have limited legal rights to control what personal information is collected and how it is maintained, used, and shared. For example, consumers generally cannot choose which CRAs maintain their information and do not have the legal right to delete their records with CRA. Federal and state agencies share oversight of consumer reporting agencies and data furnisher activities. At the federal level, CFP B has supervisory authority over certain CRAs (such as those that provide consumer reports) and shares enforcement and rulemaking authority with FTC for certain statutes applicable to all CRAs; however, generally it has broader authority over CRAs than FTC. In addition to federal laws, state agencies may have enforcement authority under their state laws to oversee CRAs under certain circumstances. Federal agencies that have oversight authority for data furnishing—such as depository institutions, credit unions, and nondepository institution furnishers—are the Federal Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC. Their oversight authority depends on the type of the furnisher, suchAs if the furnishers are a nonbank institution, depository institution, or credit union. The prudential regulatory agencies have supervisory and enforcement authority for FCRA and other federal consumer financial laws, and GAO found that they do not perform standalone examinations of these financial institutions for compliance with FCRA. Rather, they examine for compliance in conjunction with other consumer financial law and regulations and as part of examining an institution's compliance with federal consumer protection laws. Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified various causes for inaccuracies and processes that exist to help promote accuracy, including CRAs matching data to the wrong consumer files due to missing, inaccurate, or inconsistent personally identifiable information; errors in furnished data; the timing of data updates; and identity fraud or theft. In particular, stakeholders most frequently cited CRAs mismatching data and errors in data and furnished data as the primary causes of consumer reports inaccuracies. In response to potential inaccuracies, consumers can dispute the accuracy or completeness of their consumer reports with the CRAs that produced the consumer reports, with the data furnaceishers, or both. Under FCRA, CRAs are required to conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes, and if a furnisher does not conduct an investigation and report the results to the CRA within the time frame required, the CRA must remove the disputed information from the consumer's file or modify the information and notify the furnishing agency of the action taken. In some cases, consumers also have the option of filing a consumer statement on the consumer report if they disagree with the results of an investigation. CFPb's supervisory oversight has focused on CRAs representing the greatest potential risks to consumers and has generally focused on certain compliance areas, particularly data accuracy and investigations conducted in response to consumer disputes. In prioritizing examinations of data Furnishers, the agency has primarily considered the market shares of data furn
Treasury, in coordination with OMB, prepares the CFS, which contains the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government. GAO's audit of the fiscal year 2017 CFS found that certain material weaknesses in internal control over the processes used to prepare the report, including weaknesses in the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of certain information in the Financial Report and in the Reconciliation Statements. In addition, GAO identified additional weaknesses in controls over certain information reported in the draft fiscal year 2018 Financial Report related to new federal accounting standards, restatements, reclassifications, and adjustments to beginning net position, and legal contingency losses. Treasury and OMB also did not have adequate processes and procedures for reporting appropriate information regarding legal contingencies in the 2018 CFS. Treasury did not provide sufficient documentation supporting its efforts to develop and implement or enhance procedures or other steps to reasonably assure that the 2018 Financial report is complete and accurate. As a result of these weaknesses, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) did not consistently report appropriate information on legal contingency expenses in the Fiscal Year 2018 Capital Financial Statement (CFS). Significant component entities are responsible for properly accounting for and reporting legal contingency costs in their entity-level financial statements and submitting this information to Treasury for inclusion in the C FS. For each entity- level financial statement audit, U. S. generally accepted government auditing standards require that component entity auditors obtain written legal representations as part of the audit. Treasury's procedures call for it to determine whether the financial statement information that the significant component entities submitted and Treasury used to compile the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 Capital Financial Statements is consistent with the entities' management schedules, legal representation letters, and the government-wide legal representation letter. Treasury identified various inconsistencies among the significant components' financial statements information, management schedules and legal representations, as well as inconsistencies between the government's legal representations and those of the entities. However, because of the extensive amount of time needed to perform this analysis, Treasury was not always able to timely follow up and resolve the differences with the significant entities. For example, Treasury noted that one significant component entity included estimated loss amounts for reasonably possible cases in its management schedule and that such amounts were not reported in its financial information provided to Treasury. Treasury was unable to timely resolve the issue, and as a result, the 2018 financial statement was not appropriately adjusted to include these amounts. Further, DOJ did not complete and provide GAO with the final government- Wide Legal Representation Letter as of our audit completion date. In its comments on a draft of this report, OMB generally agreed with the draft report and Treasury's written response. OMB noted that the current administration is committed to continuing to work with Treasury and federal agencies to achieve sound financial management.
The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) is responsible for conducting the decennial census, a constitutionally-mandated activity that counts all people once, once only once, and in the right place at the right time. The Bureau's Partnership Program aims to maximize participation in the census by partnering with community partners, such as churches, schools, and other organizations, to promote participation. The Partnership Program has two main components that deliver outreach at the national and local levels: the National Partnership Program (NPP) and the Community Partnership and Engagement Program (CPEP). NPP and CPEP are intended to complement and leverage their respective expertise to help maximize participation by partners. The roughly 1,500 Partnership specialists hired for 2020 are temporary Bureau employees who implement CPEP and are responsible for, among others things, establishing local partnerships and engaging those partners to host activities and events (known as “commitments”) within the communities they serve. These commitments could include activities such as conducting knowledge-sharing seminars, issuing press releases, providing questionnaire assistance, producing pamphlets, and hosting field recruiting events, among other things. CPEP is also expected to play a key role in the Bureau's efforts to reach hard-to-count populations, which include minorities, young children, renters, and those living in places with access barriers (such as gated communities or locked buildings). GAO was asked to review the Partnership Program for the 2020 Census. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Bureau has addressed prior challenges related to its partnership and outreach efforts in prior censuses and (2) the nature of the challenges the Bureau faces going forward. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials. GAO also reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and prior GAO reports. The Department of Commerce said it agreed with the findings of this report and will continue to work to implement related open recommendations from GAO's prior reports. While the Bureau reported that the 2010 Census did not have a significant net undercount or net overcount nationally, the Bureau also reported that errors in coverage were unevenly distributed through the population, as shown in the figure below. Prior censuses have shown statistically significant undercounts of non-Hispanic Asians, American Indians off (as well as on) Reservations, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders. These errors are problematic because certain groups such as minorities and young children are more likely to be missed, while other groups, like those who may own a second, seasonal home, are more often counted more than once. According to the Bureau, hard to count groups can share some or all of the following characteristics: Hard to Locate: Some groups are hard to locate because where they live is unknown, or they move frequently. Hard to Persuade: Other groups are difficult to persuade to participate in the Census. Hard To Interview : Some groups may have communication barriers, including limited English proficiency. Hard-To-Count Areas: Some areas may have high response rates for the census, while others may have low response rates because they have limited or no access to the Census Bureau's outreach efforts. The nature of this challenge is that, as the Bureau adapts its timing and procedures for outreach and promotion, as well as data collection, there is a possibility of uneven effects resulting on the participation rates of different groups. For example, messaging and operations that emphasize the importance of filling out the census online, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may not be applicable to communities or groups with limited internet access. As a result, if social distancing measures result in fewer successful interviews during Non-Response Follow-Up, for instance, then these groups with less internet access will be at relatively greater risk of being missed by the census. Adapting field enumeration procedures to implement social Distancing might also be less effective in addressing respondent concerns about interacting with strangers in apartment buildings or other densely populated areas if a census worker cannot practically distance themselves from the door.
In October 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the SUPPORT Act) was enacted and reauthorized ONDCP and a number of its programs. The SUPPORT Act aims to address overprescribing and opioid misuse in the United States and includes provisions involving law enforcement, public health, and healthcare financing and coverage. The National Drug Control Strategy is to set forth a comprehensive plan to reduce illicit drug use and the consequences of such drug use by limiting the availability of and reducing the demand for illegal drugs. GAO was asked to testify on its ongoing work on federal drug control efforts. This statement discusses preliminary observations from GAO's ongoing work related to the 2019 National Drug control strategy. It is based on GAO reports and testimonies issued from October 2017 through January 2019 on federal efforts to reduce drug use, including GAO-19-27 on the National Guard Counterdrug Program (GAO-2019-27). GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of National Drugs Control Policy (ONDCP) is responsible for leading the national drug control effort, coordinating and overseeing the implementation of national drug policy, assessing and certifying the adequacy of National Drugcontrol Program programs and the budget for those programs, and evaluating the effectiveness of drug control policy efforts. As part of this ongoing work, GAO has begun reviewing the January 31, 2019, National DrugControl Strategy, which OND CP issued on January 31. The Strategy provides a high-level vision of the federal government's approach to drug control and provides some general descriptions of federal agencies' activities. However, preliminary observations related to this strategy indicate that it does not include several pieces of required information, such as quantifiable and measurable objectives. For example, one of the Strategy's measures of effectiveness is that evidence-based addiction treatment, particularly medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, is more accessible nationwide for those who need it, but there is no information on the current level of treatment access, any targets for expanding access, or any associated timeline by which ONdCP hopes to achieve desired results. The 2019 Strategy also lacks a 5-year projection for program and budget priorities. The lack of information in the Strategy on assessing progress toward its objective to reduce lives lost reflects findings from previous GAO work, including that only one of five strategies related to combating illicit opioids included outcome-oriented performance measures. Outcome measures address the results of programs and services, and they can help in assessing the status of program operations, identifying areas that need improvement, and ensuring accountability for results. Among other things, in March 2018 GAO recommended that ONDCA establish outcome measures to assess progress towards the goals set out in the Heroin Response Strategy. While ONDC neither agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation, in June 2018 it told GAO that it had engaged with leaders from the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas participating in the heroin response strategy to develop performance measures, including some outcome measures. As of March 4, 2019 GAO continues to believe that establishing these measures would enhance the HIDTAs' ability to assess whether these efforts are producing intended results.
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is the primary federal agency responsible for ensuring the safety of the nation's freight rail system. In recent years, railroads have increased the length of freight trains, and some freight trains have been longer than 10,000 feet. These longer trains can cause safety concerns, such as increased congestion and blocked grade crossings. GAO was asked to review issues related to longer trains. This report examines (1) the extent to which freight train length has increased in recent years; (2) the potential impacts of longer trains on safety; and (3) considerations for safely operating longer trains and potential impacts on communities. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FRA data on freight train-length from 2008 through 2017 and interviewed officials from DOT, Class I railroads, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and other stakeholders. According to officials from all seven freight railroads and representatives from the American Association of Railroads (AAR), FRA, the Surface Transportation Board (STB), AAR, and other federal agencies GAO interviewed, freight train lengths have increased in the last 10 years; however, the data are limited. For example, according to data that two railroads provided to GAO, their average train length increased over the 10-year period of 2008 to 2017 by about 1,500 feet for one railroad (from about 6,000 to 6,100 feet, or up to 1.4 miles) and about 1.2 miles for the other railroad ( from about 4,900 to 6.100 feet). These data represent an increase in the average length of a train of about 25 percent for both railroads. Officials from all the railroads stated that they operate longer trains in some rail corridors as a way to increase efficiencies and decrease costs by reducing the number of train crew and other costs. However, officials from the National League of Cities, as well as state and local officials GAO spoke with, expressed concerns that longer trains may increase the likelihood of unsafe behavior among motorists and pedestrians at grade crossings, which can lead to delays for emergency responders and increase the risk of a crash. Stakeholders identified a number of considerations for safe operation of longer freight trains and their potential impacts, including train makeup and handling, crew training, and braking. For instance, accordingto FRA officials, the current performance standard for air brakes was last updated in 1947 and based on tests for trains with up to 150 railcars, which are longer than the average number of railcars per train, and may not be appropriate for longer trains because of limitations in the technology used to control braking forces. In the fall of 2017, FRA began a study to understand operational risks of long freight trains. FRA plans to complete the study in 2020 and issue a report by the end of 2021. While FRA's study is under way, the agency lacks a current, documented strategy for how it will use and share the results of its research with relevant stakeholders. Federal internal control standards call for management to communicate quality information—using appropriate methods—both internally and externally in order to achieve an entity's objectives and respond to risks. F RA's strategic plan for research and development, which outlined how the agency shares research results and engages with internal and external stakeholders in support of FRA’s rail safety mission, expired in 2017. More specifically, this plan outlined key stakeholders and their roles—including labor and industry partners—and specific outreach strategies such as holding periodic, public events to present FRAs research. This plan also stated that FRA provides the scientific and technological basis for its rulemaking and regulation enforcement and that effectively sharing the results increases the likelihood that its research will have “real world” impacts. While the agency is currently updating its strategic plan, it does not have any other documented policies in place for how FRA will use or disseminate the findings of its study. Formulating specific strategies and linking them with goals and objectives is critical for agencies to achieve these goals. Without a strategy for sharing its research results with stakeholders and implementing that strategy for its research on the safety impacts of very long trains, it may lose an opportunity to effectively work with stakeholders to address any risks of operating long trains.
The Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (OCWR) administers the CAA, as amended, which applies 13 federal civil rights, workplace, and labor laws to legislative branch employees who were previously exempted from such coverage. OCWR relies extensively on IT services and systems provided by external parties to support its mission-related operations and protect claims data. GAO was asked to review OCWR's cybersecurity management activities. This report examines the extent to which OCWR (1) incorporated key cybersecurity activities into the project planning for its claims management system upgrade, (2) performed oversight of security controls and mitigated risks for selected externally-operated systems, and (3) established an effective organization-wide approach for managing cybersecurity risk. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed OCWR project planning, reviewed cybersecurity policies, procedures, and documentation, and interviewed OCWR and external partners. The Office of congressional workplace rights (OC WR) did not incorporate key cybersecurity-related project planning activities, such as project scheduling, requirements management, and risk management, into the Secure Online Claims Reporting and Tracking E-Filing System upgrade (SOCRATES) project planning. As a result, OCWR was left without a complete understanding of potential schedule issues, the system's planned security requirements, and cybersecurity risks to the success of the project. For example, the office did not use a project schedule to manage key SOCRATES cybersecurity activities, including those to be completed by OCWR, the Library, and the contractor. The Library provided an early project schedule with certain cybersecurity activities it performed related to the CMS project. However, the lack of a schedule likely hindered OC WR's ability to respond to changes during the project and execute these activities in a timely manner. OC WR did not establish a requirements management process or develop a set of detailed system requirements, including cybersecurity requirements. Instead, OC WR established a setof business flow diagrams, which identified how claim information would move within OCWR. Further, the Office did not develop a detailed set of cybersecurity requirements (e.g., what cybersecurity controls were to be implemented). OCWR did not document and manage risks to SOCRATE, including risks related to cybersecurity, and did not mitigate those risks that could have had a critical impact on the system. For instance, the library did not ensure that all moderate-level security controls were tested before the system was deployed, and this was not documented or managed as a risk by OC WR. The office also did not fully implement oversight activities for the two selected externally operated systems, including establishing security and privacy requirements, planning the assessment of controls, conducting the assessment, and reviewing the assessment. Until OCWR develops and implements such policies and procedures, future IT projects--such as the office's planned transition of its Federal Modernization Act system to the Library--may face unnecessary cybersecurity risks and may not be carried out in an efficient and effective manner. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) cybersecurity framework is intended to support federal agencies as they develop, implement, and continuously improve their cybersecurity risk management programs. In this regard, the framework identifies cybersecurity activities for achieving specific outcomes over the lifecycle of an organization's management of cybersecurity risk and calls for, among other things, a risk executive in the form of an individual or group that provides agency-wide oversight of risk activities and facilitates collaboration among stakeholders and consistent application of the risk management strategy.
The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) estimates that the cost of the 2020 Census will be $15.6 billion, approximately a $3 billion increase over the $12.3 billion it estimated in October 2015. GAO has previously reported that the Bureau's cost estimate was not reliable and did not adequately account for risk. The House Committee on Government Reform and its Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations and Intergovernmental Affairs asked GAO to testify on its work related to the cost, accuracy, schedule, and security of the census. This statement addresses the extent to which the Bureau has (1) implemented key cost-saving innovations and ensured they function under operational conditions; (2) managed the development and testing of its information technology (IT) systems; (3) ensured the cybersecurity of its systems and data; and (4) developed a quality cost estimate for the census and prevented further cost increases. To do this work, GAO reviewed Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials. The 2020 Census remains on GAO's list of high-risk programs because, among other things, innovations never before used in prior enumerations are not expected to be fully tested, the Bureau continues to face challenges in implementing IT systems, and the Bureau faces significant cybersecurity risks. If not sufficiently addressed, these risks could adversely impact the cost and quality of the enumeration. Moreover, the risks are compounded by other factors that contribute to the challenge of conducting a successful census, such as the nation's increasingly diverse population and concerns over personal privacy. The Bureau is working with federal and industry partners, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to improve its cybersecurity efforts. Since January 2017, DHS has been providing cybersecurity assistance to the Bureau in five areas: management coordination and executive support, cybersecurity threat intelligence and information sharing enhancement, network and infrastructure security and resilience, incident response and management readiness through a Federal Incident Response Evaluation assessment, and risk management and vulnerability assessments for specific high-value assets provided by the Bureau. In the last 2 years, DHS provided 42 recommendations to assist the Bureau to strengthen its cybersecurity. Among other things the recommendations pertained to strengthening cyber incident management capabilities, penetration testing and web application assessments of select systems, phishing assessments to gain access to sensitive personal information, and cyber incident coordination. In April 2019, GAE reported that, among others, the bureau had not established a formal process for documenting, tracking, and completing corrective actions for all of the recommendations provided by DHS. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for agencies to establish effective internal control monitoring that includes a process to promptly resolve the findings of audits and other reviews. Specifically, agencies should document and complete corrective actions to remediate identified deficiencies on a timely basis. This would include correcting identified deficiencies or demonstrating that the findings and recommendations do not warrant agency action. As of late May 2019, the agency was working to address this recommendation. Going forward, continued management attention and oversight will be vital for ensuring that risks are managed, preparations stay on track, and that the Census Bureau is held accountable for implementing the census, as planned. The difficulties facing the Bureau are symptomatic of deeper organizational issues. Following the 2010 Census, a key lesson learned for 2020 that GAO identified was ensuring that the bureau's organizational culture and structure, as well as its approach to strategic planning, human capital management, internal collaboration, knowledge sharing, capital decision-making, risk and change management, and other internal functions are aligned toward delivering more cost-effective outcomes. Although important steps have been taken in at least some of these areas, far more work is needed. The key elements needed to make progress in these areas are top-level attention by the administration and agency officials in the areas of leadership commitment, ensuring capacity, developing a corrective action plan, regular monitoring, and demonstrating progress.
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress created a multi-agency framework that established agency responsibilities for securing the nation's transportation systems. Within this framework, two components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)--the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the U.S. Coast Guard--are responsible for most transportation security activities. TSA is the primary federal agency responsible for security in all modes of transportation, including civil aviation, passenger and freight rail, highway and motor carrier transportation, and pipeline transportation. The Coast Guard is responsible for maritime transportation security, though TSA plays a role in managing, for example, credentialing for workers at seaports. GAO was asked to review TSA's national strategy for transportation security. This report examines (1) the extent to which the 2018 National Strategy for Transportation Security is consistent with desirable characteristics of an effective national strategy and (2) the role the national strategy plays in guiding federal transportation security efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the 2018 national strategy, interviewed TSA, Coast Guard, and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials, and reviewed related documents. The 2018 National strategy for Transportation security is generally consistent with the six desirable characteristics GAO has previously identified for effective national strategies. For example, it is fully consistent with two of these six characteristics and partially consistent with four, as shown in the table below. The national strategy generally did not guide federal efforts, including resource decisions. Officials from TSA's strategy office stated that the strategy was not intended to do so. Instead, the strategy is intended to inform transportation security decisions, such as those related to risk-based priorities. However, officials from TSA and Coast Guard stated that they generally use other strategy documents to guide their transportation security programs and activities. For instance, TSA officials stated that TSA's aviation policy is driven by requirements established through statute and regulation rather than by the strategy, and the Coast Guard uses the strategy to inform federal partners of its maritime security activities, but Coast Guard officials said the strategy does not require them to take on activities they are not already doing; instead, it puts those activities in context. TSA officials also stated that several different strategies and planning documents with similar areas of focus resulted in redundancy or overlap with the 2018 strategy. When overlap exists, there may be opportunities to increase efficiency in creating and using strategies to make transportation security-related decisions. In addition, while the strategy lays out areas where it could inform decision-making across modes, the information about transportation activities' effectiveness does not currently lend itself to meaningful comparisons. TSA's Transportation Sector Security Risk Assessment does provide information to compare risks across aviation and surface modes; however, that information is not included in the strategy. Similar information related to Coast Guard risks is also not included, though available in Coast Guard risk assessments. The National Strategy is to be the governing document for federal efforts to secure transportation systems, but its unclear position among numerous related strategies has clouded its value in guiding these efforts. By communicating to key stakeholders how the strategy aligns with related strategies, DHS, in consultation with DOT, can better communicate the applicability of the strategy so that key stakeholders have clear direction on how to rely on the strategy as it develops future iterations.
The CSBG program is intended to reduce poverty, empower low-income families and individuals to become self-sufficient, and revitalize low- income communities. In fiscal year 2017, the latest data available, local agencies received about $700 million in CSBG funds. The CSBG Act requires GAO to review the oversight of the program. GAO examined (1) the activities that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and states conduct to oversee the state and local agencies that receive CSBG funding and (2) the extent to which HHS assesses the outcomes of theCSBG program. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, federal grants management guidance, and agency documents and interviewed HHS and state officials in three states selected based on their oversight of local agencies and six local agencies in six other states selected on the basis of grant amounts and other factors. The three states GAO visited—New York, North Dakota, and Texas—conducted routine oversight activities, such as onsite compliance evaluations, during fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and provided training and technical assistance to help local agencies meet CSBG requirements. State and local agency officials GAO interviewed in the three states also cited a variety of practices that contribute to effective oversight. For example, state officials said that they determine what training they need to offer based on analysis of feedback and specific requests from local agencies. HHS's Office of Community Services (OCS) uses outcome data from state agencies that collect and aggregate data from local CSBG recipients to provide an indication of CSBG's progress in meeting the three national program goals. However, several elements of OCS's new performance management approach do not align with leading practices in federal performance management and internal control standards. Specifically, OCS is developing a new national measure intended to provide a total number of individuals who achieved at least one positive outcome from CSBG funded programs or services, but it is unclear which of the three program goals the new measure is being used to assess. The new measure does not specify which of these three national goals it will address, nor how the other two national goals will be addressed. OCS officials told GAO that they are working to establish ways to provide more information and analysis on programs and their outcomes, but they have not yet developed a national measure for revitalizing low-cost communities. The Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) requires agencies to establish performance goals and a balanced set of performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators as appropriate, in measuring or assessing progress toward those goals. Additional leading performance management practices state that performance measures should be tied to the specific goals of a program. While OCS has been redesigning how it oversees and manages the performance of the federal Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program since fiscal year 2016 to better align with GPRAMA, several of the new elements of its new approach are not aligned with federal leading practices. For instance, the new approach does not include a written plan for how OCS will assess the reliability of state performance outcome data collected for its new measure or how it will assess data reliability for future years. By not aligning its new performance approach with federal internal control and performance management leading practices related to program goals, performance measures, and data reliability, O CS cannot properly assess its progress toward meeting the CSBG national goals.
Hospice care focuses on the comfort of patients who are terminally ill (palliative care), not curing the illness. Patients are eligible for hospice care under Medicare if they have a life expectancy of six months or less and are receiving care at home, which typically includes use of controlled substances, including opioids such as oxycodone, to provide pain relief. The Controlled Substances Act regulates the manufacture, distribution, use, and disposal of these substances, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the primary agency with responsibility for administering and enforcing the law. GAO was asked to review issues related to the disposal of patients' controlled substances in home hospice. This report describes (1) selected home hospices' experiences, best practices, and challenges in managing controlled substances and (2) what is known about selected hospice experiences disposing of and preventing the diversion of controlled substance in home settings. To do this work, GAO reviewed laws and regulations and interviewed officials from seven hospices selected from five states with disposal laws and six states without such laws. The Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Home hospices GAO selected for review had a variety of approaches to managing controlled substance diversion in their homes. According to officials from these hospices and state hospice associations, hospices utilize various strategies or best practices to attempt to mitigate diversion risks, including, but not limited to, patient and family member education on controlled substance use and disposal. For example, officials from five of the selected hospices told GAO that they educate patients and their family members on how to properly use controlled substances. Officials from four hospices said they conduct prescription drug counts at every visit to check if the proper amounts of medications remain, and one hospice reported that its employees document drug counts. Officials also said they may use lockboxes to store medications and limit access to only an alert patient or their caregiver if drug diversion is suspected to be a risk or if there are children present in the patient's home. In addition, some hospices use in-home disposal products, such as syringes, to dispose of medications in the home, and officials from four of the hospices stated they believe these to be the safest disposal methods, even though, according to the officials, it can be costly. Officials described various challenges associated with disposal, including: certain disposal methods may be too costly; disposal can be time-consuming and resource-intensive; there may be inconsistencies between state laws and federal law; a patient's family may not always be present at the time of a drug count or disposal; and family members and caregivers sometimes refuse to disposal of medications. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that oversees Medicare-certified hospices, is required by law to have written policies and procedures for the safe disposal of controlled Substances in patients' homes. CMS does not oversee the disposal process. The Department of Justice's (DOJ) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are responsible for investigating instances of diversion, but according to DEA officials, DEA's oversight is limited to instances of suspected or actual diversion. This is because the SUPPORT Act allows employees of qualified home Hospice Service providers, whether they are registered with DEA or not, to disposed of unused controlled substances without registering with DEA. The SUPPORT Act also allows the Attorney General to issue guidance to hospices regarding the disposal and prevention of diversion.
In 1992, Congress established the Section 219 program to provide planning and design assistance to nonfederal sponsors in carrying out 18 environmental infrastructure projects, located in certain specified locations around the United States. In subsequent acts, Congress authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to provide construction assistance for Section 219 projects, and significantly expanded the number of authorized projects. From fiscal years 1992 through 2017, the Corps expended over $440 million on these projects. GAO was asked to review the Corps' management of Section 219. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Corps has expended funds on Section 219 since its inception and (2) how the Corps prioritizes funding for these projects and the factors it considers when doing so. To do this work, GAO reviewed Corps documents and interviewed Corps headquarters, division, and district officials. The Corps expended about $81 million on 29 projects from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 to develop drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure, among other projects. The 29 projects varied in terms of the geographic area covered, such as a city, county, or region (e.g., multiple counties). For example, 10 of the projects focused on the environmental infrastructure needs of cities, nine focused on counties, and 10 on regions. Of the 29 projects, only one was completed; the project in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, was completed in fiscal year 2014. The remaining 28 projects were ongoing, as of November 2018, with 17 in the construction phase and 11 in the preconstruction engineering and design phase. During the same period, 14 projects expended more than $1 million each, representing a total of $78.2 million. In particular, over half of the funding during this time period was spent on four projects: the Calumet Region in Indiana; DeSoto County, Mississippi; Jackson County in Mississippi; and Lakes Marion and Moultrie in South Carolina. These four projects generally consisted of multiple subprojects and covered a wide geographic area. The majority of these projects (24 of the 29) were authorized in 2000 or earlier and were ongoing as of 2018. In recent years, congressional direction has indicated that the Corps, when allocating funding for environmental infrastructure, is to consider giving priority for projects that have certain characteristics. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act in 2017 directed the Corps to consider characteristics such as projects: with the greater economic impact; in rural communities; in communities with significant shoreline and instances of runoff; in or that benefit counties or parishes with high poverty rates; and in financially distressed municipalities. Corps officials GAO interviewed said that while they are generally aware of this congressional direction, they do not use it to guide the ranking process. Corps headquarters officials said that they have not developed written criteria to prioritize Section 219 funding because the agency considers these projects to be outside the agency's core mission areas such as flood control. Corps budget guidance indicates the criteria each core mission area should use in ranking projects, but it does not specify criteria for other types of projects. In the absence of written criteria, Corps officials use their discretion on how to rank projects for funding. Federal standards for internal control states that agencies should use quality information to achieve their objectives by identifying information requirements. The federal standards also call for agencies to design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. By establishing written criteria for ranking Section 219 project funding as it has for other Civil Works programs within its core missions, the agency would have greater assurance that its project selections align with a clear set of priorities. Further, Congress has provided direction to the Corps on which characteristics to consider in prioritizing Section 219 funds, but Corps officials stated that they use this direction to guide their ranking of Section219 projects.
EPA uses compliance monitoring and enforcement to ensure that regulated entities comply with environmental laws and regulations. EPA has elevated the role of such activities in its overall enforcement efforts. GAO was asked to review EPA's oversight of these activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which EPA collects and maintains data on its compliance monitoring, enforcement, and compliance assistance activities, and (2) how EPA communicates the results of its monitoring activities and enforcement actions to the public and Congress through its website and annual reports. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed EPA's policies and procedures, analyzed agency data, and interviewed EPA headquarters and regional officials. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires its 10 regional offices to collect and enter a range of information on compliance monitoring activities—such as permit, inspection, and violations data—into its national databases. The agency uses these data to manage its oversight efforts and assess how well the efforts are meeting the agency's strategic objectives. In addition, EPA is piloting an effort to collect data on coordination with states. However, EPA regional offices do not consistently collect or maintain data on informal enforcement actions, such as the number of warning letters sent to regulated entities, and do not require data on compliance assistance. EPA does not have complete information on these activities because it does not require the collection of such data. According to federal standards for internal control, management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks by clearly documenting internal control in management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals. Without clearly documenting in guidance to the regional offices that they should collect data and specifying which mechanism to use to maintain the data, EPA will not have the information it needs to track progress toward its strategic objective of increasing the agency’s use of compliance assistance to help regulated entities compliance with laws and Regulations. EPA makes data on enforcement and compliance monitoring results available to Congress and the public through its annual reports and website, but neither of its 2018 annual reports includes a readily identifiable section or appendix that discusses the known limitations of the data. For example, the 2018 annual results report does not fully describe how the data in the report should be interpreted given the known data limitations the report contains. By including such information in its reports and providing information on the intended use of its data, as called for by leading practices for transparently reporting government data and as exemplified in existing EPA guidance, EPA would have better assurance that the data presented in the reports are reliable and that Congress is informed about the data and their intended use.
The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on PME to prepare its military personnel for the intellectual demands of complex contingences and major conflicts that typically involve more than a single military service. The military services' intermediate- and senior-level PME programs are designed for officers at pay grades O-4 through O-6. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the military services are responsible for overseeing the services' PME and JPME programs. The Senate Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the military service PME program oversight. This report examines (1) the extent to which the military Services' intermediate and senior level PME schools have met the requirements for accreditation and (2) DOD's ability to oversee and assess the effectiveness of these programs. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed DOD and military service officials. All of the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Army National Guard intermediate-and senior- level professional military education (PME) programs have been accredited to award master's degrees, but not all programs met the seminar student mix accreditation requirement, which requires that each PME seminar contain at least one student from each of the two non-host military departments: the Army, the Navy (which includes the Marine Corps), and the Air Force. The Joint Professional Military Education (JPME), a subset of PME, is designed to provide officers with knowledge and skills to operate in joint environments, such as combatant commands, and to develop joint awareness, perspective, and attitude. All but one of the military departments' senior- and intermediate-level programs met this requirement from academic years 2014 through 2018. For example, during that time, the Army's senior-levels and Air Force's intermediate-levels met the requirement to have at least 1 student from the Navy for each of their seminars. However, not all of the Navy's and Marine Corps' intermediate level programs met it. The Navy stated that it was unable to provide the other military services with the required numbers of officers during academic years 2016-2018 because of competing staffing priorities, but GAO found that the Navy provided sufficient officers to its own intermediate level program during each of these academic years so that it could have instead assigned the required number of officers to other military departments to meet their respective Sea Service requirements. The Office of Personnel Management (OPMEP) and the Joint Staff Directorate for Joint Force Development told GAO that satisfying the OPMEP common educational standard of developing joint awareness and perspective is dependent on time and intensity of student interaction with students from other military department students. Without this interaction, military service and Joint Staff officials stated it was difficult for Air Force and Army officers to gain a full appreciation of Navy's contribution to joint military operations when there were no Sea Service students in the seminar. In the situations where a seminar did not have Sea Service representation, officials told us that a decision was made to award students JPME credit. DOD's Office of Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (OUSD(P&R) and its subordinate office (i.e., Defense Acquisition Science and Technology Directorate (DASD(FE&T)))—which is responsible for oversight of all aspects of education and training for military personnel following basic officer and enlisted training, including PME—has not been involved in determining whether the Navy can assign the requisite number of Navy officers to the military department's programs to meet the joint acculturation goal of JPME. DOD has not evaluated or approved the mitigation steps, either before or after-the-fact, when a JPME program lacks representation to meet this requirement. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. Developing guidance concerning actions, if any, the services can take to mitigate student mix shortfalls and still meet the intent of the OPEMP's joint awareness common educational standards could better position DOD and the services to ensure that DOD's programs are meeting their objectives. OSD has had PME oversight responsibilities for more than 30 years; however, while it has taken some steps to strengthen its oversight, it is not well-positioned to assess the overall effectiveness of its programs because it does not have a department-wide mission statement for PME that clearly defines the
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has long recognized that some charitable donors and tax-exempt organizations have engaged in abusive tax schemes, such as grossly overvaluing a charitable contribution to obtain a larger deduction on their tax returns. GAO was asked to review IRS's efforts to identify abusive schemes involving tax- exempt entities. This report describes (1) ways in which taxpayers have abused a tax exempt entity through abusive schemes and (2) trends in IRS's compliance and the characteristics of taxpayers audited for using abusive schemes. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed IRS audit and disclosure data for fiscal years 2008 through 2017, the most recent years for which complete data were available; reviewed documentation on programs that help IRS identify possible abusive schemes; and interviewed IRS officials. Taxpayers seeking to reduce their tax liability through charitable donations may participate in legal tax planning strategies that allow them to maximize their deductions while giving to charitable organizations. In contrast to these legal strategies, abusive schemes occur when taxpayers conduct transactions that are not supported by established law to improperly claim tax benefits, or that have no economic significance or business purpose other than the avoidance of tax, among other factors. The following three examples illustrate various ways that an entity's tax-exemption status can be used in transactions that were inconsistent with the law's intent, and how otherwise legitimate tax exempt activity can be exploited improperly: syndicated conservation easements, donor-advised funds, and patient assistance programs. In a syndicated easement, a conservation easement becomes “syndicated” if a person or company promoting the easement (a promoter) offers multiple investors in a partnership or pass-through entity the opportunity to claim charitable deductions based on the value of the easements in return for cash. The Brookings Institution estimated that investments in syndicated conservatorship easements totaled $623 million in 2016, an increase of 29 percent from $484 million in 2015, and estimated that the tax deductions resulted in federal tax revenue loss between $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion in 2016. In donor-Advised Funds, a fund or account held by a charity that receives contributions from donors who may advise, but not control, how the organization uses the money. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 defined these funds in the Internal Revenue Code and subjected the funds to new requirements. Some donors may use the funds in ways that IRS considers improper. Patient assistance programs help patients afflicted with certain medical ailments obtain financial assistance for medical care or free drug products. Pharmaceutical companies may establish their own programs or donate medication (through in-kind product donations) to independent charities' programs. Donations such as these allow pharmaceutical companies to claim a limited tax deduction for charitable contributions. If they claim deductions, the deductions may be up to 10 percent of the corporations' taxable income when donating to charities. The possibility of donors receiving private benefits in excess of the charitable deduction creates potential risks to participating pharmaceutical companies and compliance challenges for IRS, according to federal regulators. The federal government has investigated cases of potential private benefit by pharmaceutical companies. For example, IRS filed a court summons in May 2017 in an ongoing investigation of a patient assistance program over concerns that it spent the majority of its donations on copayment support that went to patients who were prescribed medication from companies that had donated money to the program. The number of audits involving tax exempt entities generally declined over the 10-year period from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017. Audits involving these entities resulted in higher average tax changes than audits for the total of all abusive transactions. The average tax change per audit was $89,399 in fiscal year 2016 and $8.6 million in 2017 for the two operating divisions that conduct audits of abusive schemes—the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division (TE/GE) and the Small Business/Self-Employed Division (SB/SE) and Large Business and International Division (LB&I). SB/SE and LB&I spent a total of 218 hours per audit on audits of tax exempt schemes, on average, compared to the average of 42 hours for all abusive-transaction audits over the period. The majority of taxpayers with audits involving exempt entities had an adjusted gross income (AGI) of more than $50,000, with about 40 percent of these audits involving taxpayers with AGI falling between $100,000 and $500,000.
ONDCP is responsible for leading the nation's fight against the drug epidemic. The SUPPORT Act of 2018 requires ONDCP to develop a National Drug Control Strategy, which is to set forth a comprehensive plan to reduce illicit drug use and the consequences of such drug use in the United States by limiting the availability of and reducing the demand for illegal drugs, among other things. The Strategy is to include a 5-year projection for program and budget priorities and a description of how each comprehensive, research-based, long-range quantifiable goal in the Strategy will be achieved. GAO was asked to review the Strategy. In March 2019, GAO testified that the Strategy did not include certain information required under the OND CP Reauthorization Act of 2006, which was the applicable law at the time the Strategy was being drafted. The Senate Appropriations Committee report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, included a provision for GAO to review and report on the Strategy's implementation. This report examines (1) the extent to which ONDDPC addressed selected statutory requirements related to the Strategy in 2017, 2018, or 2019, and (2) ONO's approach to meeting selected new requirements in the SUPPORT Act for the 2020 and future Strategy iterations and the Drug Control Data Dashboard. To address these objectives, we reviewed the Strategy and three companion documents issued in April and May 2019. The Office of National Drug control Policy (ONDCP) did not fully address selected requirements in 2017 and 2018 related to issuing the National Drugcontrol Strategy in accordance with statutory requirements. For example, the Strategy is required to include annual quantifiable and measurable objectives and specific targets. However, it does not include annual targets for the other intervening years—2018, 2020, and 2021, as required. In addition, the 2019 Strategy does not provide a 5 year projection for budget priorities. In lieu of a Strategy, ONO officials stated that they used other sources to formulate the administration's priorities, which served as the basis for drug control funding guidance for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. The 2019 Strategy states that it establishes the Administration's drug control priorities and provides federal drug control departments and agencies strategic guidance for developing their own drug control plans and strategies, and that the strategy is intended to ensure federal budget dollars are allocated in a manner consistent with the priorities. The 2018 SUPPORT Act, as enacted in October 2018, requires ONO to issue the 2020 Strategy in February 2020. In October 2019, ONCOP officials told GAO that the 2020 strategy would be issued by the first Monday in February (February 3, 2020). However, as of October 2019 ONO could not provide in writing or otherwise describe key planning elements to ensure it can meet selected new SUPPORT Act requirements for the Strategy, such as descriptions of resource investments, time frames, and any necessary processes, policies, roles, and responsibilities to address each requirement. Developing and documenting these planning elements will help ensure that ONO follows a routine planning process going forward and that future iterations of the Strategy that it develops are consistent with these requirements.
On October 24, 2018, Super Typhoon Yutu made landfall in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), one of five U.S. territories, causing widespread damage to Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. The typhoon severely damaged utility infrastructure on all three islands, including downed power lines, transformers, and poles, which caused power outages across all the islands. The CNMI is a self-governing commonwealth in political union with the United States. The United States granted the CNMI the right of self-governance over internal affairs and complete responsibility and authority for matters relating to foreign affairs and defense affecting the islands in a 1976 Covenant. The Covenant initially made many federal laws applicable to the islands, but preserved the islands' exemption from certain federal laws that had previously been inapplicable to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, including certain federal minimum wage provisions and immigration laws, with some limited exceptions. Under the terms of the Covenant, the federal government has the right to apply federal law in these exempted areas without the consent of theCNMI government. In 2008, Congress amended the joint resolution approving the covenant to provide for an orderly transition of foreign workers to work temporarily in the islands through the CW-1 program, which allows foreign workers who meet certain requirements to temporarily work in the territories. Congress has amended the covenant several times since 2008, with provisions that affected the length of the transition period, the number of permits allocated, and the distribution of permits. This report examines (1) economic trends and (2) trends in the composition of CNMI workforce, including the ratio of United States workers to foreign workers during the previous 5 calendar years. GAO analyzed CNMI government and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data on the economy, workforce, and visitor arrivals and departures for fiscal years 2017 through 2019, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed federal, CNMI, and U. S. government officials. For fiscal year 2019, GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Commerce and Homeland Security provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The Commonwealth and the NorthernMariana Islands' economy grew every year from 2012 to 2017, but declined in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). GDP, in 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars, grew from $1.022 billion in 2015 to 2017 before contracting in 2018. BEA attributes this economic growth to exports of services, which reflected continued growth in visitor spending, particularly for casino gambling. In 2018, GDP fell by 20 percent, due to a drop in visitors, in particular spending on casino gambling, where revenues fell over 50 percent. In fiscal year 2017, visitor arrivals dropped from more than 653,000 in 2017 to about 607,000 and in fiscal year 2018 to less than 425,000. According to BEA, the decline in visitors in early fiscal year2019 was attributable to the devastation caused by Super TyphoonYutu in October 2018. In November 2018, following the devastation of the typhoon, the total number of visitor arrivals plummeted from the previous month's total of 32,108 to 5,595, representing an 88 percent decline from November 2017, when 48,039 visitors arrived. From fiscal years 2005 to 2019, arrivals from China and South Korea increased from about 32,000 to 186,000, while Japanese arrivals declined from about 376,000 (71 percent of total visitors) to about 12,000(3 percent) in 2019. While eligible Japanese and South Korean visitors enter the islands under a visa waiver program, Chinese visitors are ineligible for the program but can remain temporarily as tourists under DHS's discretionary parole authority. In addition, in January 2020, the Governor of the Commonwealth declared a state of significant emergency related to the spread of the coronavirus from China, suspended the arrival of travelers from mainland China for 30 days, and ordered a cost-impact analysis on the effects the ban will have on the Commonwealth's economy. In the tourism sector, the government has provided for the licensing of casinos on Tinian and Saipans, but both casinos have faced challenges. Tinian: Tinian Dynasty Hotel and Casino was investigated and cited by several federal agencies and closed in 2015. Most recently, following an Internal Revenue Service investigation, the U.N. Department of Justice filed a criminal complaint against the casino operator and two
The federal government is one of the world's largest and most complex entities, with more than $3.3 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2019. GAO has identified federal programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives with duplicative goals and activities. Section 21 of Public Law 111-139, enacted in 2010, requires GAO to report annually to Congress on its findings, including the cost of such duplication, with recommendations for consolidation and elimination to reduce duplication and specific rescissions (legislation canceling previously enacted budget authority) that Congress may wish to consider. Since 2011, GAO's annual reports have identified approximately 325 new areas of fragmentation, overlap, or duplication across the federal government. This report is the latest in a series of products GAO will provide Congress and executive branch agencies to assess the extent to which Congress and agencies have made progress in implementing the 908 actions GAO identified in its 2011 to 2020 annual reports. To identify additional opportunities for cost savings and enhanced revenues, this report presents 18 new areas where greater efficiencies or effectiveness in providing government services may be achievable. The report also highlights 11 other new opportunities for potential cost savings or revenue enhancements. In addition to these 29 new areas, we identified 88 new actions related to 10 existing areas presented in our 2011 to 2019 annual reports, as of March 2020. In all, we have identified 1,076 actions since 2011 that could potentially result in tens of billions of dollars in additional financial benefits to Congress and the executive branch. These include 110 actions directed to Congress, including three new congressional actions identified in 2020. We also directed 966 actions to executive branches, including 165 new actions identified for 2020. Of the 110 actions, 58 (about 53 percent) and 966 (about 42 percent) remained open as of February 2020. The remaining 467 actions are partially addressed, not addressed, or new. We identified potential financial benefits associated with many open areas where additional action could result in millions of dollars to tens of billion of dollars. For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) could potentially save hundreds of million of dollars annually by accurately measuring and reducing excess funded, unfinished work at military depots. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) should establish a formal collaborative mechanism to better manage fragmented efforts and enhance compliance for certain individual retirement accounts that engaged in prohibited transactions, and thereby potentially increase revenues by millions of $1 billion or more. The Department of Veterans Affairs should assess duplication between VA's Medical-Surgical Prime Vendor and Federal Supply Schedule programs to determine if this duplication is necessary or if efficiencies can be gained. The Office of Management and Budget should develop a strategy for ensuring that agencies communicate sufficient and timely internal control plans for effective oversight of disaster relief funds. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should ensure that the results of the Working Capital Fund's business process analyses are assessed to better determine how these analyses contribute to its goal of efficient delivery of goods and services. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should establish formal processes to solicit input from officials directly involved in the agencies' response and recovery following a disaster and share that input with the Emergency Support Function Leadership Group.
SSA's organizational payees—organizations that manage individuals' Social Security retirement, disability, or other benefits—are critical to ensuring beneficiaries' basic needs are met. GAO was asked to review SSA's oversight of payees. This report examines how SSA: (1) approves organizations to be representative payees, (2) communicates with organizational payee representatives, and (3) oversees organizationalpayees. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and SSA policies and guidance; analyzed program data; and interviewed SSA officials and representatives from eight field offices in seven states selected to reflect a range in geographic location, among other factors. The Social Security Administration's (SSA) process for approving organizations to serve as payees (organizational payees) has several gaps that may increase the risk of approving an unsuitable payee. For example, SSA policy does not require staff to conduct background or credit checks on most organizationalpayee applicants, and it only conducts credit checks for organizations that apply to collect fees for payee services. SSA also lacks a comprehensive plan for evaluating if and how to expand background and credit checks to organizational payes. Without such checks, the agency risks unknowingly approving questionable organizational applicants, therefore increasing the risk that beneficiary funds may be misused. GA O also identified challenges that field offices may face when approving replacement payees such as a lack of local payees and difficulty locating some beneficiaries. In the absence of detailed and centrally-approved policy guidance on how to assess complex suitability factors for approving payee applicants—such as whether an organization has a history of being current in its own financial obligations—SSA may not be sure that field office staff are consistently and appropriately evaluating applicants' suitability. Also, without a plan, including timeframes, for evaluating whether and how it should conduct background checks on organizational paye applicants—as it does for individual payee applicant applicants—the agency may forgo potentially valuable safeguards for further protecting vulnerable beneficiaries. Once approved, organizational payeaters rely on SSA for information or action in order to effectively carry out their responsibilities. To ensure payees are managing beneficiary funds appropriately, SS relies on a number of monitoring mechanisms, including onsite reviews, annual accounting forms, and collective accounts. However, S SA does not have a mechanism to systematically collect and analyze payee feedback to determine if programmatic changes are warranted. Without a formal mechanism for collecting and analyzing payees' feedback and ideas for program improvement, it is unclear whether SSA is receiving complete or current impressions from payees on how efficient its processes are or how timely it responds to their needs. Being aware of and responding to payee concerns might help the agency retain and attract organizations to help meet its mission and ensure it is well-positioned to meet future challenges, such as an aging population.
The DATA Act requires OMB and Treasury to establish government-wide financial data standards that include common data elements for financial and payment information required to be reported by federal agencies and entities receiving federal funds. These standards, to the extent reasonable and practicable, must be capable of being continually upgraded as necessary. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the DATA Act. This report examines (1) the extent to which OMB has established a governance structure for data standards, (2) how interagency advisory groups have evolved during DATA Act implementation, and (3) how the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) have addressed GAO's prior recommendations for data governance. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed OMB, Treasury, and agency documents and interviewed OMB staff. In December 2018, OMB officials told GAO that they are transitioning from the governance structure used for initial implementation of DATA Act data standards to a new structure for managing data standards within the broader context of efforts to establish a federal data strategy. The governance structure that OMB used in initial implementation included an interagency Shared Solutions Governance Board (SSGB) and Business Standards Council (BSC), both led by the General Services Administration (GSA). The SSGB and BSC are responsible for setting goals and providing advice to promote a governmentwide marketplace for shared services. Specifically, they cover mission-support services such as human resources and financial management that a small number of providers offer to many agencies. According to OMB Staff, this oversight function involves creating and administering data standards established to support the Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), as amended ( DATA Act). GAO has previously reported that establishing a data governance structure—an institutionalized set of policies and procedures for providing data governance throughout the life cycle of developing and implementing data standards—is critical for ensuring that the integrity of the standards is maintained over time. The need for a data Governance structure is underscored by previous analyses of the quality of the federal spending data available on USAspending.gov (or a successor website) and inconsistencies GAO identified in how agencies report data according to data standards. For example, in November 2017 GAO found that inconsistent data were reported about the locations where the federal government spends money, because some agencies used OMB's DATA Act definition of the Primary Place of Performance data element, while other agencies used definitions from other sources, such as the data dictionary for the Federal Procurement Data System – Next Generation (FPDS-NG). In June 2018, in response to the findings of GAO’s November 2017 report, O MB made changes to some of the definitions and clarified policies about how they are to be applied, but did not communicate those changes to stakeholders, including the public. OMB did not provide documentation showing that the revisions were communicated to the public or to specific categories of stakeholders, suchAs users of the data standards in the federalgovernment. Without transparent communication of changes to data definition standards, stakeholders—including staff at federal agencies required to report data—may miss important information relating to changes in how, when, and by whom data definitions are applied. The staff may then report data that are not consistent and comparable across the government. Such inconsistent reporting can undermine the transparency goals of theDATA Act, particularly when it affects key data elements such as those describing geographical information. In the absence of a clear set of institutionalized policies and processes for developing standards and for adjudicating necessary changes, the ability to sustain progress and maintain the integrity and consistency of established data standards may be jeopardized as priorities and data standards shift over time, potentially resulting in missed deadlines.
Veterans' utilization of VA nursing home care—across three settings—increased 3 percent from fiscal year 2012 through 2017, from an average daily census of 37,687 to 38,880 veterans to an average of 45,279 per day by fiscal year 2022, according to VA data. GAO was asked to review VA's oversight of veterans' care in nursing homes. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA's two contractors conducted required annual inspections of nursing homes and (2) VA's efforts to provide information to veterans and their families on the quality of care in all three settings. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed VA data on nursing home inspections, reviewed VA policies and procedures, and interviewed VA officials at six VA medical centers (VAMC) selected based on geographic location and other factors. During the contract year completed in 2018, the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Nursing Home Contractor performed the required annual nursing home (NHS) inspections of all of the nursing homes with which VA provides or pays for care for veterans to determine whether they met quality standards. However, VA has opportunities to enhance its oversight of the contractors' inspections by regularly monitoring both contractors' performance inspecting nursing homes through observational assessments and by citing all deficiencies. Although VA's plans call for quarterly observational assessments, they have not been consistently conducted and documented. Similarly, VA does not require its nursing home contractor to identify all failures to meet quality standards as deficiencies during its inspections, which limits VA's ability to track deficiencies and identify trends in quality across homes. VA also has not provided guidance for VAMC staff to conduct onsite reviews of nursing home facilities, which are optional under VA policy. As a result, VA missed an opportunity to leverage efficiencies across VA's network of VAMCs and empower officials with knowledge about the steps they can take to hold nursing homes accountable for correcting problems. By making enhancements to its oversight, VA would have greater assurance that the inspections are effective in ensuring that each veteran chooses a nursing home placement that best meets his or her preferences and needs. VA publicly provides information on care quality for certain nursing home settings through its Access to Care website, but does not provide information on quality of skilled nursing homes (SVH), which is where most veterans receive care. VA is the only entity that inspects and collects quality information on all SVHs, which is not available elsewhere. VA's SVH strategic plan indicates that VA sees the value in developing SVH ratings that could be used to provide quality information for veterans and families to help them make informed decisions about nursing home placements. Since VA's website does not contain information on SVH quality, veterans and family members are limited in their ability to evaluate all of their nursing home options.
SDFRs—farmers and ranchers whose members have been subject to racial, ethnic, or gender prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities—accounted for about 30 percent of all U.S. farms in 2017 and accounted for 13 percent of the market value of agricultural products sold. SDFR advocates have raised concerns about the lack of access to agricultural credit for SDFRs. GAO was asked to review issues related to agricultural lending to these groups. This report examines (1) what is known about the amount and types of agricultural credit to socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers (SDFR), (2) challenges SDFrs reportedly face in obtaining agricultural credit, and (3) outreach efforts by lenders and federal agencies to provide and oversee credit-related services to S DFRs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; analyzed USDA data; and interviewed officials from USDA, federal depository institution regulators, advocacy and research organizations, lending industry associations, and federal agency officials. Information on the types and amount of agricultural loans and credit to Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers is limited. For example, the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Service Agency makes direct loans and guarantees loans made by commercial banks and other lenders, but does not collect data on the personal characteristics of loan applicants. In contrast, USDA collects and maintains data on applicants for the farm loans it makes or guarantees in order to target loans to traditionally underserved populations and fulfill statutorily mandated reporting requirements. The lack of personal characteristic data on a large portion of agricultural loan applications limits the ability of regulators, researchers, and stakeholders to assess potential risks for discrimination. In a July 2009 report, we found that federal enforcement agencies and regulators faced challenges in consistently, efficiently, and effectively overseeing and enforcing fair lending laws due in part to data limitations. Additionally, such data would enhance transparency by helping researchers and others better assess the potential risk of discrimination. For its current review, some federal regulators GAO spoke with said that additional data on nonmortgage lending would allow them to perform additional assessments of financial institutions' compliance with fair lending law. Some S DFR advocates we spoke with also expressed concern about the absence of accurate public information, which they said forces them to rely on anecdotal evidence in attempts to monitor potential discrimination. USDA's annual survey of farm producers, the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), provides some insights into agricultural lending for socially disadvantaged groups but has limitations when used for this purpose. These limitations include the small size of several subgroups (which prevented more detailed analysis of different demographic groups), the potential underrepresentation of SDFs in the survey, and potential overreporting of debt from commercial lenders. According to USDA, the survey data should be interpreted with caution because the survey may underrepresent the total outstanding farm debt of socially disadvantaged group. The survey data suggest that the 2012 Census and the 2015–2017 surveys (which used similar methodologies) may have underreported the number of women designated as primary producers, particularly women. However, the 2017 Census included revisions that better captured the role of women in farm operations, and its results suggest that in the 2015-2017 surveys, women represented 17 percent of primary producers (compared to 30 percent in the 2017 survey). According to federal regulators and lending industry association representatives GAO interviewed, according to some estimates, SDFS may have difficulty obtaining private agricultural credit because they operate smaller farms and in some cases do not meet standards for farm revenue, applicant credit history, and collateral, such as land. Some of these challenges may be exacerbated by limited outreach by private lenders to historically disadvantaged groups. USDA facilitates and provides outreach to disadvantaged groups on its lending programs, but data-collection challenges hamper evaluation of outcomes. USDA conducts outreach to increase socially disadvantaged participation in its programs through activities targeted to underserved communities, but outreach on USDA-guaranteed farm loans is just one component of this broad-based effort. USDA officials said they track these outreach activities but do not maintain data on activities that specifically address guaranteed loans because the outreach is generally intended to connect disadvantaged groups with any USDA program that may be appropriate. In addition, USDA generally does not evaluate whether outreach participants go on to use USDA lending programs or otherwise evaluate the impact of its outreach on lending to disadvantaged populations.
The U.S. Coast Guard's ATON program consists of fixed and floating aids to navigation (ATON), which include lighthouses, towers, and other structures that are directly affixed to the ground or seabed; and floating ATON, which are buoys and markers anchored to the sea bed by a concrete or metal sinker connected by a chain or mooring. GAO was asked to review the Coast Guards management of ATON. This report examines (1) the condition of fixed ATON and (2) the extent to which the Coast Coast Guard has developed plans and initiatives to address ATON management challenges and has assurance that they will be effectively implemented. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed Coast Guard ATON data from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, reviewed Coast Guard documents, and interviewed Coast Guard officials. The condition of the U. S. U.s. Coast guardS ATON declined slightly from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018, while the costs for repairing and recapitalizing ATON increased. The Coast Guard reported that fixed and Floating ATONwhich include lighthouse, tower, and buoys attached to the seabeds and anchored by a sinkerdeclined from 98.0 to 97.1 percent in the percentage of time they were functioning correctly in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, which is slightly below its performance target percentage of 97.5 percent. However, other factorssuch as the age of many ATON—have contributed to more significant declines in ATON for some locations. For example, an internal Coast Guard report states that, as of 2018, nearly a quarter (24 percent) of all floating ATon and over half (59 percent of all fixed ATons) are operating past their designed service lives. The majority of the remaining ATON have reached, or will soon be reaching, the end of their service lives, which could lead to an increase in the number of aging ATON requiring major repairs or replacement in the near future. According to Coast Guard data, the ability to refurbish or replace ATON is made more challenging by limited capacity for conducting major repairs and refurbishments of floating ATons. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard have taken positive steps to manage the ATON programs, including issuing strategic plans and directions, creating a unit to provide a Coast Guard-wide perspective in managing ATON in 2016, and developing various initiatives to improve management of the program. For instance, in June 2007, the agency issued the Maritime Short Range Aids to Navigation Strategic Plan to coordinate and standardize a number of mission activities. The plan identified initiatives, such as developing year-round floating ice ATON to reduce seasonal workloads and increasing the use of LED lighting to reduce lighting costs. The agency also created the Waterways Operations Product Line (WOPL) in 2016 to centrally manage the distribution, repair, and replacement of fixed, floating, and parts; as well as to formulate requests for ATON resources and funding. In March 2019, WOPL awarded four regional contracts to provide increased capacity to repair and refurbishment ATON major repairs in an effort to reduce a backlog of repair projects. The agencies have also developed various initiatives that are intended to improve the management of both fixed andfloating ATON but do not contain certain elements that can provide better assurance that the initiatives will be effective, suchAs milestones and completion dates, and desired outcomes to be achieved. The Program Management Institute guidance states that programs or projects are to include specific, desired outcomes, along with the appropriate steps and time frames needed to achieve the final outcomes and results to implement the enhanced capabilities across the organization. By updating its ATON-related initiatives to include the specific outcomes desired and timeframes for completing them, the Coast guard would have better assurances that its initiatives to manage ATON will be implemented.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs. FDA reviews generic drug applications to ensure that they meet the regulatory requirements for approval. In 2012, GDUFA was enacted, in part, to provide more generic drug application reviewers at FDA in order to handle an increase in the volume of application submissions and speed up reviews. GAO was asked to review FDA's generic drug review process. This report examines (1) the extent to which FDA approved generic drugs in the first review cycle and factors that may have contributed to whether applications were approved, and (2) FDA's efforts to increase the rates of approval for generic drugs during the first cycle of review. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FDA data from fiscal years 2015 through 2017, reviewed FDA guidance and documents, and interviewed FDA officials and representatives from a nongeneralizable sample of five generic drug applicants, five trade associations, and 10 stakeholders selected based on size and other factors, among other things. FDA approved 12 percent of the 2,030 generic drugs applications that it reviewed in fiscal year 2017. The rate of approval was lower for applications that had previously been refused, such as those that were not substantially complete upon their first submission, and for applications with two previously refused attempts. In addition, applications for drugs with certain routes of administration—such as oral, topical, or intravenous—had different approval rates. For example, generic applications for 41 ophthalmic and 20 transdermal drugs—types of drugs that FDA considers complex—had no approval in the 2017 review cycle, while applications for topical drugs, which FDA also identifies as complex, had a higher approval rate of 25 percent. FDA has taken steps to enhance communication with applicants and improve the consistency of reviewers' comments, but opportunities exist to enhance its efforts to improve the rate of generic drug approvals in the First Review Cycle. In response to the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (GDUFA) and its successor, the Generic Drugs User fee Amendments of 2017, FDA has made changes to its review process to improve communications with applicants, including increasing the frequency and timing of communications and providing additional guidance to applicants. FDA also has issued new and revised product-specific guidance to help applicants develop generic drugs and has taken other steps to improve consistency among reviewers. However, while stakeholders stated that the changes FDA made to improve reviewer consistency were positive, they noted that inconsistency among reviewers still remained, and GAO also found inconsistencies among reviewers in the clarity and content of comments provided to applicants during the review cycle. FDA's Manual of Policies and Procedures describes a standard process for reviewers to use when assessing the completeness of applications, including clearly communicating with applicants about deficiencies that must be corrected to reduce the number of review cycles. In GAO's review of documentation for 35 applications, the most common deficiencies were related to the quality of the drug—356 out of 435 deficiencies—and GAO found variation in some reviewer comments, including a lack of clarity in the information required for the applicant to address the comments. In the review of four applications GAO reviewed in more detail—two that received approval and two that did not—GAO identified 32 instances in which the written comments did not fully meet FDA's criteria. Two of the four applications had similar numbers and types of deficiencies identified in the discipline review letters sent to the applicants mid-way through the review process, but the clarity of the comments varied considerably. For one application, the comments were written clearly and, consistent with FDA's manual of policies and procedures, identified options for addressing the deficiencies. For the other application, they were less clear and did not clearly identify ways to address these deficiencies. The applicant of the application with clearly written comments resolved all of the deficiencies raised in their discipline review letter and the application was approved. In contrast, the applicant of another application did not resolve all deficiencies raised and was not approved. Inconsistency among reviewers could affect FDA's ability to meet its goal of increasing the rate at which generic drugs are approved in theFirst Review Cycle, which is the first of two review cycles, and could delay some generic drugs from entering the market if applicants require more time to understand and respond to unclear comments. FDA officials noted that although secondary reviewers are experienced, they do not consistently receive additional training to ensure clarity and consistency among primary reviewers. FDA offers training in clear writing for FDA employees but is not required for reviewers.
The Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Diversion Control Division is responsible for preventing, detecting, and investigating the diversion of controlled substances from legitimate sources while ensuring an adequate and uninterrupted supply is available for legitimate medical, commercial, and scientific needs. GAO was asked to review DEA's efforts to prevent, detect, and investigate opioid diversion. This report examines the extent to which DEA obtains and uses (1) industry-reported data, and the opportunities that exist to improve how that data are obtained and used, including the feasibility of real-time reporting; (2) DEA registrant legal reporting requirements related to prescription drug orders and the meaning of suspicious orders; and (3) how DEA assesses the results of the data it obtains from its system and through suspicious order reporting. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DEA documents and interviewed DEA officials, industry stakeholders, and private sector industry members. The views of these stakeholders are not generalizable to the entire population, but provide insights on how industry detects and reports suspicious opioid orders. DEA collects and uses self-reported drug transaction data from registrants, such as pharmacies and drug distributors, to support its diversion control efforts. These data are used to identify suspicious orders, which are orders of unusual size, deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and unusual frequency before they are filled. For example, DEA collects suspicious order reports from pharmacies and distributors. DEA also collects data from state prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), which are electronic databases that track controlled substance prescriptions, managed within and at the state level. PDMPs can provide health care providers and authorities timely information about prescribing and patient behaviors that may indicate drug abuse or diversion and facilitate a response. In addition, DEA uses data-analytics activities to prevent and detect diversion, including data matching and data mining. However, DEA does not have a formalized data governance structure to manage its collection and use of these data. DEA's current practices do not reflect select leading data governance practices, including identifying data needs to answer key agency questions; providing resources explicitly to leverage assets; prioritizing data governance; and supporting non-federal stakeholders. Although DEA is in the early stages of developing such a structure, it is unclear how or if these efforts will incorporate leading practices for data governance and if they will be effective. While DEA has developed some performance measures to track and publicly report the progress and results of its efforts in reducing diversion, it has not developed objectives, outcome-oriented goals, or measurable performance targets to assess the effectiveness of its opioid diversion control data analysis efforts and the link between DEA's use of data and progress toward its diversion goals and strategies. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) as amended by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) directs agencies to develop and document goals, as well as performance measures, to assess progress towards their goals. DEA officials view their existing performance goals as sufficient overall, but without defining objectives in specific measurable terms, DEA is likely not able to adequately assess whether its respective investments and efforts are helping it to limit the availability of and better respond to the opioid prescription diversion threat. DEA has taken some steps to help industry report suspicious orders. In October 2019, DEA launched a new centralized database for registrants that distribute controlled substances, called the Suspicious Orders Report System (SORS) Online, which is required by the SUPPORT Act to be established by October 24, 2019. SORS Online is a centralized database that allows registrants to report suspicious drug order reports to DEA. The successful implementation of the centralized database is important because it could address the fragmented way in which reports are currently submitted and could assist DEA in reporting on how it is using ARCOS data to detect and investigate suspicious activities. DEA uses ARCOS to monitor the flow of transactions of schedule I, II, III, and select schedule IV drugs from their point of manufacture to the point of sale or distribution at the dispensing/retail level (such as hospitals, retail pharmacies, practitioners, and teaching institutions). GAO found that while DEA uses SORS to support ongoing investigations and conducts analysis on this data to identify investigative leads for its field division offices, it could conduct more robust analysis using automated computer algorithms to help identify questionable patterns in the data.
Rural transit providers, which provide service to the general public within their service areas, are sometimes challenged with providing an efficient and coordinated transit service for VA or Medicaid beneficiaries to access their programs. GAO was asked to review coordination of rural transit services. This report examines (1) factors that affect rural transit coordination, (2) actions taken by selected rural transit providers to improve coordination, and (3) the extent to which the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has facilitated coordination and shared information on coordination opportunities and leading coordination practices with state and local stakeholders. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed federal, state, and local officials, as well as representatives from a nongeneralizable sample of 43 rural and tribal transit providers selected based on geographic location and other factors, among other things. The results of these interviews are not generalizable, but provided insights on coordination efforts. Various factors can affect rural transportation coordination, according to stakeholders GAO interviewed, participants in discussion groups, and literature reviewed. These factors include the availability of resources, alignment of different federal program requirements, and the distances between transit providers. For example, almost two-thirds of the stakeholders (30 of 43) and participants in three discussion groups told GAO that it is difficult to coordinate transit services in rural communities with limited resources, such as funding, staff, and time, and technology. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and FTA have taken a number of steps to enhance and facilitate coordination, including having interagency meetings, trainings, and webinars to coordinate interagency efforts that support rural communities and improve transportation access to health and human services. However, FTA does not have a comprehensive plan or strategy that assesses what information state, local, and transit providers would benefit from receiving and how that information can be effectively communicated. Without such a strategy, stakeholders are without valuable information that could aid them in identifying potential coordination opportunities, leading practices, and data to help inform and facilitate their coordination efforts, which is important to help meet the increasing needs of those who rely on rural transit systems, particularly in light of limited resources. Despite encountering some of the factors that can make coordination difficult, all of the selected rural transportation providers GAO spoke with said that they currently coordinate trips or schedules with other local or regional stakeholders. Such coordination efforts include establishing common drop-off points or common schedules, coordinating to provide access to services, and using technologies to facilitate coordination of transportation. The most commonly cited coordination and resource-sharing activities included pursuing funding from several programs and raising local revenue for transit, participating in opportunities to share knowledge, and sharing vehicles and related resources. Although FTA has several efforts under way to facilitate interagency coordination, more than a third of stakeholders stated that communication and information sharing has been limited. FTA officials told us that they develop individualized communication plans when they undertake any major activities and examine an approach to communicating and sharing information when they develop annual statements of work for their three technical centers and meet with stakeholders, but FTA could not provide GAO with a documented strategy that outlines how it communicates and shares coordination-focused information with stakeholders. In light of the multiple means by which FTA and the Coordinating Council are attempting to communicate information about coordinating rural and Tribal Transit Services, a comprehensive strategy assessing what information providers would need and how it can be communicated could help FTA's information-sharing efforts have their intended effect.
U.S. airports play an important role in supporting the nation's aviation industry, with more than 19,000 airports serving more than 20 million passengers in 2017. However, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as of 2017, the national airport system had about 3,300 airports with a total capacity of about 3.5 million passengers per year. GAO was asked to review airports' infrastructure funding and financing. This report discusses (1) levels of federal and other funding that airports received from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 for infrastructure investments, (2) projected costs of planned infrastructure investments for fiscal years 2019 through 2023, and (3) any challenges selected airports face in obtaining airports' funding. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed airport funding data from FAA's System of Airports Reporting (SOAR) database, reviewed documents, and interviewed officials from FAA, the Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA), the American Association of Airport Executives (AAE), the International Air Transport Association (IAE), and a nongeneralizable sample of 19 airports selected based on size, hub size, and other factors, among other things. For fiscal years 2017 through 2021, airports received an annual average of about $15 billion in funding from a variety of sources for infrastructure development projects, including federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants, airport-generated revenue, and capital contributions. These figures, however, do not represent the full amount of funding that is available to airports. For example, some airports also received funding from state grants and bond proceeds through debt financing to fund airport infrastructure investments. In addition, the proportion of funding from these sources varies, with smaller airports receiving the largest share of AIP grant funding compared to larger airports (75 percent compared to 25 percent for larger airports). GAO's analysis of airports' planned infrastructure costs shows that planned infrastructure projects are projected to cost an average of $22 billion annually for fiscal year (FY) 2019 through FY 2023. This estimate reflects an increase of 19 percent from FY 2017 through FY 2021 infrastructure cost estimates, largely driven by an increase in planned projects that are not eligible for AIP grants, such as terminal projects. According to FAA, these projects represented 53 percent of the total estimated infrastructure costs for FY 2019-2023. FAA officials and ACI- NA representatives stated that the increased focus on terminal projects is due in part to airlines changing their business models and aircraft fleets and an overall increase in passenger traffic. Officials from most (18 out of 19) of the 19 airports GAO spoke to stated that they are planning terminal improvement projects over the next 5 years. These airports told GAO they are focused on making terminal improvements because existing terminals are aging and in need of repairs and to accommodate an increased in passenger enplanements due to airlines' use of larger aircraft holding more passengers. Airports are taking steps to address challenges related to funding sources, AIP eligibility criteria, and competing airport and airline priorities, but GAO found that some airports face challenges in obtaining airport infrastructure funding. Specifically, airport officials stated that existing funding sources may not be sufficient to cover the costs of future infrastructure projects, and they are taking actions to address these challenges. For instance, officials from three small hub airports stated they are currently facing challenges obtaining financing for infrastructure projects because they are already fully leveraged and have pledged their PFCs over the mid- to long-term, limiting their ability to use debt financing for other projects.
The Department of Defense (DOD) is in the midst of a multibillion-dollar acquisition effort to modernize its space systems, including satellites, ground systems, and user equipment. DOD's space systems support a wide range of capabilities to a large number of users, including the military services, the intelligence community, civil agencies, and others. These capabilities include positioning, navigation, and timing; meteorology; missile warning; and secure communications, among others. Space systems can take a long time to develop and involve multiple segments, including space, ground control stations, terminals, user equipment, and launch. DOD is also in the beginning phases of acquiring several constellations of new satellites and ground processing capabilities--including for missile warning, protected communications, space-based environmental monitoring, and space command and control. In addition, DOD is exploring alternatives for acquiring wideband satellite communications as well as funding development of new launch vehicles as it pursues a new acquisition strategy for procuring launch services. GAO's prior work has shown that many major DOD space programs have experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays. For instance, the total program cost for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite program, a protected satellite communications system, has grown 117 percent since the program's original cost estimate and its first satellite was launched more than 3.5 years late. For the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS), a missile warning satellite system, the program cost grew 265 percent from its original estimate and the launch of the first satellite has been delayed roughly 9 years. Cost and schedule growth is sometimes driven by the inherent risks associated with developing complex space technology; however, over the past 10 years GAO has identified a number of other management and oversight problems that have worsened the situation. These include making overly optimistic cost and schedule estimates, pushing programs forward without sufficient knowledge about technology and design, and experiencing problems in overseeing and managing contractors, among other problems. DOD faces significant challenges as it replenishes its satellite Constellations. First, it is confronted with growing threats in space, which may require very different satellite architectures and acquisition strategies. Second, the department is planning major changes to its leadership for space. While these changes are designed to streamline decision-making and bring together a dispersed space workforce, they could cause some disruption to space system acquisition programs. Third, in fiscal year 2016, Congress required DOD to establish guidance to speed up acquisition timeframes by streamlining acquisition processes and oversight for certain acquisitions. For space, challenges with past streamlining efforts may offer some lessons learned. Fourth, DOD may face resource and capacity challenges in taking on multiple space acquisitions at one time. For example, GAO and other reports point to potential gaps in the space acquisition workforce and ongoing difficulties managing software development. Finally, DOD faces challenges in protecting its weapon systems—satellites and ground systems included—from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.
Medicaid is a joint federal-state health care program that provides health care coverage to low-income and medically needy individuals. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for overseeing Medicaid, while states administer their respective Medicaid programs' day-to-day operations. States have significant flexibility to design and implement their programs, resulting in more than 50 distinct state-based programs. The federal government requires coverage for certain mandatory services under Medicaid, but states may decide to include other optional services as well. Some of the largest and most commonly included services include prescription drugs, nursing facilities, home and community-based care, and hospital inpatient care. GAO was asked to review issues related to access to MAT medications. This report examines (1) the extent to which state and federal policies, including some related to distribution methods, can restrict Medicaid beneficiaries' access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) medications and (2) efforts by states and CMS to address these barriers. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal and state laws, regulations, policies, and literature; interviewed officials from CMS, state Medicaid agencies, drug manufacturers, providers, and other stakeholders; and conducted fieldwork in four selected states—North Carolina, Minnesota, Ohio, North Carolina, and the District of Columbia. State Medicaid programs have policies related to the coverage and distribution of prescription drugs that can restrict beneficiary access to medications used to treat opioid use disorder (OUD), such as buprenorphine and naltrexone. For example, while some of these policies are generally used to manage utilization and costs related to a wide range of medications, the research and stakeholders GAO interviewed said that these policies can also restrict beneficiaries’ access to the medications used in MAT. For instance, in 2018, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported that while all 50 states’ Medicaid programs covered oral formats of MAT medications, it found no indication that 21 states (41 percent) covered extended-release injectable or implantable versions of these medications. In addition, some states have policies that require the use of certain distribution methods when a provider prescribes a MAT medication, such as buy-and-bill, which requires the provider to purchase the medication and then bill Medicaid or another payer for the cost of the medication. Stakeholders told GAO that these distribution methods can restrict access to these medications for Medicaid beneficiaries and other patients with OUD. CMS has undertaken various coordination efforts aimed generally at addressing OUD, including the establishment of an interagency task force to develop an action plan to address OUD barriers in Medicaid, among other things, as required by the SUPPORT Act of 2018. CMS also has taken steps to increase flexibility for states seeking a section 1115 demonstration to improve access to and quality of OUD treatment for beneficiaries, including by establishing a requirement that inpatient and residential settings provide access toMAT medications. However, in GAO’s review of literature and interviews with stakeholders, it was found that requirements associated with federal waivers may limit the number of providers willing to prescribe or administer the medications for MAT. In some states, providers may be reluctant to obtain a DATA 2000 waiver, which allows them to treat a limited number of patients for OUD in an office-based setting—such as a doctor”s office—because they are not specialists in addiction medicine, or they do not want to be subject to increased oversight from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other law enforcement agencies, according to stakeholders and literature reviewed. CMS officials told us they have taken some steps to address this concern by funding new planning grants in 15 states that cover training expenses to help providers obtain the waiver, among others. Federal laws allow certain non-physicians (such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants) to obtain DATA 2000 waivers to prescribe and administer MAT medications to treat OUD; however, some state laws may restrict their ability to do so. These laws determine the type of health care services that can be provided by different types of providers. According to literature reviewed and stakeholders interviewed, physician assistants and nurse practitioners in some states are not allowed to write prescriptions for any controlled substances and some states specifically limit the ability of physician assistants to prescribe bupRenorphine for the treatment of O UD, while others may impose no restrictions for these providers.
In 2015, GAO reported that women's representation on corporate boards had increased steadily from 8 percent in 1997 to 16 percent in 2014, but that it could still take decades for women to achieve balance with men. GAO also reported in 2015 that the number of women on FHLBank boards had also increased from 2015 to 2017, but women still comprised less than 25 percent of FHL bank directors as of 2018. FHLBanks are cooperatively owned by its member institutions, including commercial and community banks, thrifts, credit unions, and insurance companies, and each of its 11 federally chartered banks has a board of directors, which is made up of 194 directors. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, and its regulations set forth a number of requirements for FHL Bank directors, including skills, term length, and the percentage who are member and independent directors. This testimony is based on GAO's 2015 and 2019 reports on board diversity on corporate and FHLbank boards and discusses (1) the extent to which women and minorities are underrepresented on boards, (2) factors that may hinder board diversity, and (3) potential strategies for increasing board diversity. To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and prior GAO work, and interviewed stakeholders, researchers, and officials from organizations knowledgeable about corporate governance and board diversity in the financial services industry. Our prior work has found that women and minority directors on boards generally lag behind men and whites, respectively. For example, in 2015, we found that in the S&P 1500, companies in which GAO analyzed, women comprised about 16 percent of boards, compared with about 8 percent of corporate boards in 1997. Similarly, in our 2019 report, we reported that the share of women board directors on Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHLBank) boards increased from October 2015 to October 2018 but that women still made up less than25 percent of these boards. Our 2019 report also found that there was an increase in directors for some minority groups, including African-American, Hispanic, and Asian, but they still reflected a small portion of these Boards. Further, the size of the increases in minority directors was less clear than for women directors due to incomplete data on directors' race and ethnicity. Stakeholders, board members, and others we interviewed said three key factors generally limited greater board diversity: not prioritizing diversity in recruitment efforts, limitations of the traditional board candidate pipeline, and low turnover of board seats. In 2015, for example, stakeholders said that boards need to prioritize diversity during the recruiting process because unconscious biases—attitudes and stereotypes that affect our actions and decisions in an unconscious manner—can limit diversity. One stakeholder observed that board directors may have a tendency to seek out individuals who look or sound like they do, further limiting diversity. In addition, our 2015 report found some indication that board appointments of women slow down once one or two women are on a board. A few stakeholders expressed some concern over boards that might add a woman to appear as though they are interested in board diversity without really making diversity a priority, sometimes referred to as “tokenism.” In 2015 we also identified challenges related to relying on traditional career pipelines to identify potential board candidates—pipelines in which female and minority candidates are also underrepresented. In 2019, we identified challenges identifying diverse board candidates within the traditional CEO talent pipeline. One CEO said that as long as boards limit their searches for directors to women executives in the traditional pipeline, boards will have a difficult time finding women. Expanding board searches beyond the traditional sources, such as CEOs, could increase qualified candidates to include those in other senior level positions such as chief financial officers, or chief human resources officers. Finally, several stakeholders GAO interviewed said that the low rate of board turnover, in large part due to the long tenure of most board directors, contributed to the slow increase in women's and minority representation on boards.
Since 1990, foreign nationals in the United States from 22 countries have been granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to protect them from removal. TPS provides temporary humanitarian protection to eligible foreign nationals who, for various reasons, may not have otherwise lawful status and, in the absence of TPS, would be subject to enforcement and removal under the INA. GAO was asked to review TPS. This report (1) describes TPS determinations and numbers of beneficiaries since TPS was established in 1990; (2) describes the approach that DHS, in consultation with State and other relevant agencies, takes to inform the Secretary of Homeland Security's TPS reviews; and (3) examines DHS's public communication regarding TPS decisions and related information, including work authorization. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed TPS data for fiscal years 1990 through 2018, reviewed documentation for a nongeneralizable sample of eight countries selected to represent a range of decision types and designation reasons, and interviewed officials from DHS, State, USCIS, and other agencies. Since 1990, about 430,000 foreign nationals from the 22 countries designated for TPS have received it, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data. Of these, about 420,000 were granted TPS in fiscal years 2000 through 2018. In fiscal year 2018, the most recent year for which data were available, the majority of beneficiaries were from three countries (El Salvador, Haiti, and Haiti). GAO found that designations for 20 of these countries were subsequently extended or the countries were redesignated one or more times. Somalia, which had the longest overall designation period, had its designation extended 21 times as of the end of fiscal year 2019 and had been redesignated twice; its most recent extension was set to expire in March 2020. As of September 30, 2019, all but four countries' TPS designations had been terminated and the termination of six countries' designations since fiscal year2018 had been temporarily halted because of ongoing litigation. In addition, about 2 percent of beneficiaries from four countries (Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) had their TPS designation extended. DHS's approach for initial or subsequent reviews of countries for TPM consists of three primary steps: 1. The Secretary may initiate consideration of a country for an initial designation in response to various triggering factors, such as armed conflict, environmental disaster, or extraordinary and temporary conditions; 2. For an existing designation approaching its end date, the Secretary is required to determine whether country conditions warrant an extension of TPM or whether the country no longer meets the statutory criteria and TPS must be terminated; and 3. For redesignating a country that was previously designated forTPS, the President exercises discretion in determining whether to redesignate the country. DHS collects four primary sources of information to inform its TPM decisions: country conditions reports compiled by USCIS and State, recommendations from USCIS or State, and information from other DHS components and non-DHS entities such as the White House, foreign governments, and nongovernmental organizations. For example, for each of the eight countries in GAO's sample of 26 decisions, DHS collected information about country conditions and recommended TPS for the Secretary to inform his or her decision. DHS officials stated that the Secretary's decisions may not always follow the recommendations of the USCIS Director or State. DHS also generally consults with the Department of State (State) but is not specifically required to do so under the statute. DHS provided memorandums or notices documenting all 26 decisions for the eight selected countries for which it rendered decisions from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 (see figure). DHS has communicated TPS-related information to the public through required notices in the Federal Register, press releases, and its website, but has not consistently identified all mechanisms used to communicate automatic extensions of employment authorization documents, which may result in confusion among employers about TPS beneficiaries' employment eligibility. USCIS published guidance on its website to inform beneficiaries and employers about the use of individually mailed notifications to communicate employment authorization document extensions, but USCIS's guidance does not consistently identify these notifications as official mechanisms to verify eligibility, resulting in confusion for some employers about whether or not to accept the documents as proof of continued employment authorization for beneficiaries. Effective information and communication are vital for an entity to achieve its objectives. Updating external guidance to clearly identify each of
The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires U.S. financial institutions to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) requirements to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. FinCEN, which administers BSA, has authority to enforce BSA and has delegated BSA/AML examination authority to the federal banking regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for BSA compliance. GAO was asked to review BSA enforcement. This report (1) describes how FinCen and supervisory agencies supervise, examine for, and enforce BDA and AML compliance; (2) discusses how FincEN, supervisory agency, and law enforcement collaborated on implementing and enforcing BSA requirements; and (3) examines the extent to which FinC EN, the agencies, and the law enforcement agencies established metrics and provided feedback to financial institutions on the usefulness of BSA reporting. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents, interviewed agency officials, and interviewed representatives from selected industry associations. The views of selected law enforcement officials are not generalizable. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the banking regulators—the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), NCUA, the Board of Governors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and SEC—supervisory agencies that oversee the banking and securities industries—including the securities and futures industries—the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and National Futures Association (NFA)—have oversight responsibilities for the activities of their members in the financial services industry. The Securities and Securities Self-regulatory Organizations (SRO) that SEC and CFTC oversee—such as FINRA and NFA—have BSA-related compliance responsibilities for their members. Supervisory agencies and SROs generally oversee financial institutions' compliance with BSA through examinations, but IRS has the authority to examine certain types of financial institutions not examined by the federal functional regulators for compliance, such as money services businesses, which are a category of nonbank financial institutions that do not include banks and do not have a large number of financial services businesses. Treasury, FinCension, and other agencies have led collaborative efforts to identify BSA goals and priorities such as issuing a national strategy and risk assessments for combating illicit financing crimes. They have also established key mechanisms for collaboration (such as interagency working groups, information-sharing agreements, and liaison positions) that encompass multiple federal, state, and local agencies and private-sector participants. However, these key mechanisms have been less inclusive of the futures industry than other financial sectors. For example, the primary futures SRO is not a regular member of BSAAG, which is the primary mechanism for industry to discuss BSA issues, and its key SRO does not have direct access to BSA data. In addition, NFA, the SRO that conducts the majority of futures BSA examinations, has not requested direct access, as recommended by GAO in a 2009 report, to data on BSA reports. Metrics were not consistently or consistently provided to industry on the use of BDA reporting and feedback to industry was not consistently provided on a small scale. Some federal agencies have taken steps to provide metrics and institution-specific feedback, but challenges remain to expanding and enhancing metrics and feedback on the value and usefulness of these efforts. For instance, while Treasury has an ongoing effort to identify additional measures of the value of BBA reporting, it is expected to be completed at the end of 2019, opportunities exist to enhance feedback and reporting before that date and in general.
This testimony discusses GAO's preliminary observations from its ongoing review of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) procurement of critical medical supplies and services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. GAO was asked to provide preliminary observations on the extent to which VA's acquisition management and medical supply management systems and practices contributed to the challenges VA experienced in responding to the pandemic, including (1) the supply chain challenges that VA experienced during the height of its response and (2) VA's efforts to address these challenges. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed VA acquisition documents and interviewed VA acquisition and logistics officials, as well as officials from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). GAO also interviewed VA medical center (VAMC) officials to obtain their views on VA's supply chain management and supply management practices. VA experienced many of the same challenges obtaining medical supplies as most private sector hospitals and other entities during the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Centers for Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response to the Pandemic Influenza Pandemic (COVID) 19 pandemic in February and March 2019. These challenges included shortages of certain critical supplies, such as respirators, masks, and isolation gowns, which were needed to protect its front-line workforce during the response. VA's procurement and logistics workforce initially had to address supply chain shortfalls while simultaneously working with VA's antiquated inventory system, through manual, daily reports on PPE levels to VA leadership. While VA has made progress in addressing some of the issues that have led GAO to identify VA acquisition management as high risk, it will take many years for VA to put in place a modern supply chain system that would position it to provide the most efficient and effective service to our nations veterans. VA is currently in the midst of a multiyear, multibillion-dollar effort to modernize its medical supply system, which includes several modernization initiatives, including MSPV 2.0, which is intended to address the shortfalls GAO previously identified in its review of VA's Medical Supply and Procurement Value-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program. In addition, VA is in the process of implementing a new supply system called Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) and its successor at all VAMCs, which will take seven years to fully implement. In the near-term, VA had planned to implement DMLSS at three medical centers in mid-to-late 2019. However, due to technology integration issues between VA's financial system and the DLASS system, implementation at these three VAMC is delayed. VA has also faced challenges in meeting its goal to have all medical centers have a fully functioning inventory system by the end of fiscal year 2020. In May 2019, the VA Inspector General found that proper inventory monitoring and management was lacking at many VAMFs, noting that inventory management practices ranged from inaccurate to nonexistent. In 2013, VA also reported on weaknesses in VA's inventory management systems, and GAO made recommendations to VA to evaluate its efforts to improve in this area. In February 2020, VA issued a Modernization Campaign Plan for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) that identified both its modernization efforts as critical risk of not meeting system modernization milestones. In March 2020, VHA issued its Modernization Plan for VHA, which describes several initiatives to improve its acquisition management, including the development of a new inventory management system. VA also issued a memorandum on March 15, 2020, to implement emergency flexibilities available under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, including increasing the micro-purchase threshold to $20,000. Based on preliminary observations of GAOs ongoing work, based on its analysis of contracting activity in the Federal Procurements Data System-Next generation (FPDS-NG), GAO found that VA is using various existing and new contracting organizations and mechanisms to try to meet its PPE needs. These include using national and regional contracting offices to procure supplies, and using existing contract vehicles and new sources. For example, VA's Network Contracting Officeswhich support the various regions of the hospital networkincreased their supply purchases, mostly by entering into new contracts. Department-wide contracting organizations that would normally not make individual supply purchases also played a substantial role.
Section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 called for organizational and management reforms to assist the Department of Defense (DOD) in addressing challenges that have hindered collaboration and integration across the department. Section 911 requires the Secretary of Defense to take several actions, such as establishing cross-functional teams, to advance a more collaborative culture within DOD. Section 918 of the John S. McCain NDAA in Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's implementation of section 911 every 6 months after the date of enactment through December 31, 2019. This report examines (1) the status of DOD's efforts to implement section 911 requirements, and (2) the extent to which DOD has met statutory requirements for cross- functional teams. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed DOD officials; and reviewed a draft of a January 2019 DOD organizational strategy, which was provided to OCMO leadership for review as early as August 2018, but has not been approved by the Acting Chief of the Office of the Chief Management Officer (OCMO) for department-wide coordination. DOD has continued to be up to 21 months late in fully addressing five remaining requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2017 related to DOD's organizational strategy and crossfunctional teams. Specifically, DOD has not fully addressed the following statutory requirements: 1. Issue an organizational strategy: As of June 2019, DOD is 21 months past the statutorily required issuance date of September 1, 2017, for issuing its organizational strategy. In May 2019, a senior OCMO official told GAO that the Acting CMO was fully committed to completing departmentwide coordination of the draft strategy in June 2019 and advancing it for issuance in July 2019. 2. Issue guidance for cross functional teams: DOD is 20 months behind the required September 30, 2018, issuance date for guidance on cross- Functional Teams. In June 2018, GAO reported that OCMO officials had revised the draft guidance to fully address all section 911 requirement and incorporate leading practices for effective cross-Functional Teams in the guidance, consistent with GAO's February 2018 recommendation. 3. Provide training: DOD has provided some of the required training to members and leaders of a recently established cross-functional team. However, OCMO has not provided training to supervisors in team members' functional organizations as required. 4. provide training to presidential appointees: DOD officials have not provided the training to individuals filling presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed positions in the Department's Office of Secretary of DOD. In February 2018, DOD had developed a draft curriculum for this training that addressed section 911, but the curriculum has not yet been approved, as required by statute. According to an OC MO official, the department has not approved the curriculum because it was delayed to ensure it aligned with other DOD strategy documents and to incorporate additional requirements in the FY 2019 NDAA. As a result, the curriculum will not be completed by the statutory deadline of September 2019. 5. Report on successes and failures of cross-operational teams: OCMO is 3 months past its required completion date for a report on the successes and failure of DOD cross- Operational Teams, which is February 2019. In August 2017, DOD established a team to address gaps in electronic warfare and joint electromagnetic spectrum operations, capabilities, and capacities within the department across personnel, procedural, and equipment areas. The team was established in February 2019, but DOD did not provide funding to the team until late May 2019—over 3 months after it was established and over 1 month after most of the team members were provided by their home units to work on the team full time. The memorandum establishing the team requires the team to develop resource requirements for team operations for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 to ensure adequate resources are immediately available. Accordingto a team official, this delay in funding hampered the team's ability to achieve full operating capability. For example, until late June 2019 the team was working from the Pentagon Conference Center and OCMO conference rooms with only one secure laptop. A team official said the team expects to be at full operational capability in late July 2019 and that the team will continue to rely on the unfunded requirements process for funding, since the team is not a budgeted activity for FY 2020 and would need to compete for funding through DOD's program budget review process for FY 2021 and later fiscal years. A senior DOD leadership commitment to fully supporting this team and fulfilling all requirements could help the department
The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) was enacted to improve federal spending transparency by requiring the disclosure of federal agency expenditures and linking agency spending data to federal program activities, so that both policymakers and the public can more effectively track federal spending. The DATA Act requires OMB and Treasury to establish government-wide data standards that to the extent reasonable and practicable provide consistent, reliable, and searchable spending data for any federal funds made available to or expended by federal agencies. GAO was asked to review DATA Act implementation. This report describes (1) the types and variations of services that the federal SSPs provide to their financial management customer agencies to assist them in implementing the DATA Act and meeting the act's requirements and (2) any challenges that the agencies have encountered in their efforts to ensure the quality of data submissions consistent with the standards established under the act and the steps they have taken to address those challenges. To address these objectives, GAO surveyed customer agencies that received DATA Act services and interviewed officials from four federal shared service providers (SSPs) that provide financial management services to customer agencies. Customer agencies that responded to GAO's survey reported that they use their federal financial management SSP for a variety of DATA Act-related services, such as general ledger accounting, financial reporting, and hosting the customer agencies' financial systems. In addition, 17 of the 27 customer agencies reported using their SSP's for payroll or budget execution services, while fewer reported using them for other financial management activities, suchAs grant or loan processing. The four federal financial managed service providers that provide services to federal agencies for DATA Act submissions—the Administrative Resource Center (ARC), Enterprise Services Center (ESC), Federal Financial Management Service (PFS), and the Interior Business Center (IBC)—provide a range of services to their customer agencies, including preparing DATA Act files, consolidating data from multiple agency components, reconciling data to other source data, and uploading files to the agency's financial management system for validation. Sixteen of 27 agencies and officials from all four federal federal S SPs identified various challenges associated with using an SSP to submit DATA Act data, many of which affected the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of agency submissions. For example, 10 agencies reported challenges related to agency submission activities that depend on relationships with, or actions being taken by, the SSP before the agency can proceed. These challenges may increase the risk that agencies will be unable to submit quality data in accordance with the act. Of the 16 agencies that identified challenges, 12 agencies reported taking steps to address them and 5 agencies said they were aware of steps their SSps had taken. These steps included increased communication and coordination, technological improvements, and manual work-arounds. Nine agencies reported that their agencies need to take additional steps, tools, and guidance to address their identified challenges. Five agencies also reported that additional tools or guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), or other entities could assist agencies with using SSP services. In April 2019, OMB issued Memorandum M-19-16 on shared services, which, among other things, described the process and desired outcomes for shared services and established a governance and accountability model for achieving them.
The U.S. Arctic, including the Bering Strait, is an essential part of the increasingly navigable Arctic and a key convergence point for maritime transportation routes connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Maritime shipping and infrastructure are critical to ensuring safe and secure maritime transportation in the Arctic. GAO was asked to review issues related to maritime infrastructure in the United States Arctic. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which maritime shipping has increased, (2) factors affecting maritime shipping in the region, and (3) federal efforts to address gaps in maritime infrastructure. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed Arctic shipping data from 2009 through 2018, the most recent year for which data were available at the time of GAO's review, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed officials from federal, state, local, and international organizations involved in Arctic maritime transportation, and Alaska Native groups. Maritime Shipping in the U. S. Arctic generally increased from 2009 to 2019 but remained limited and was affected by several factors, including changes in international demand and unpredictable conditions. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development reported in 2015 that the world fleet of commercial shipping vessels was approximately 89,000 in 2015. However, the 307 vessels operating in 2019 represented a small portion of the total number of shipping vessels operating globally. Factors affecting maritime activity include changes to international demand, unpredictable weather and sea ice, environmental hazards, and a lack of maritime infrastructure, according to stakeholders GAO interviewed. For example, in 2017, a Russian liquefied natural gas tanker became the first ship to transit the Northwest Passage (NWP) without being accompanied by an icebreaker on the Northern Sea Route (NSR) through the Canadian archipelago, which connects the Arctic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean. In 2018, a container ship successfully completed a one-off trial passage through the NSR, but Maersk, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, emphasized the route was a trial designed to gain operational experience in a new area and to test vessel systems and that it did not view the route as a commercially viable alternative to existing routes. Despite this, news reports in June 2019 indicate the company is exploring sending more goods through theNSR in cooperation with a Russian icebreaker company in response to demand for the transport of goods from Asia to West Russia. While agencies have taken some steps to address maritime infrastructure gaps, federal efforts lack a current government-wide strategy and consistent leadership to guide agencies' actions to address these gaps. Specifically, agencies do not have a government- wide strategy that includes goals, objectives, performance measures, and appropriate responses to risks to inform investment decisions. Agency officials told GAO that they currently base Arctic infrastructure decisions on their agency-specific missions, strategies, and collaborative efforts. Without such a strategy, agencies lack assurance that their actions are effectively targeting priority areas and decision makers cannot gauge the extent of progress in addressing infrastructure gaps. In addition, agencies have not established an interagency group to lead and coordinate federal efforts, as called for by leading management practices, and agencies lack clarity on which interagency entity is responsible for guiding federal efforts and providing consistent interagency leadership to ensure that federal objectives are met. As a result, agencies may miss opportunities to leverage resources toward achieving broader outcomes.
In August 2012, SEC adopted its conflict minerals disclosure rule in response to Section 1502(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The rule requires companies that manufacture, or contract to manufacture, products containing conflict minerals—tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold, and tantalum—to disclose the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals in their products. The rule also requires companies to conduct a Reasonable County of Origin Inquiry to determine whether they know, or have reason to believe, that their conflict minerals may have originated in the covered countries or that the minerals may not be from scrap or recycled sources. Companies are also required to conduct due diligence to determine the source of the minerals. GAO was asked to review companies' disclosure of conflict minerals. This report (1) examines how companies responded to the SEC's disclosure rule when filing in 2018 and (2) provides recent information on the rate of sexual violence in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed a generalizable sample of 1,117 conflict minerals filings filed in 2018, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of State, and the United Nations (UN), among others. In 2018, almost as many companies filed conflict minerals disclosures as filed in 2017 and 2016 (1,165 and 1,230, respectively). An estimated 85 percent of the companies filed as domestic, while the remaining 15 percent filed as foreign. An estimated 62 percent of companies reported using tantalum; 63 percent reported using tenga; and 66 percent, gold—percentages similar to those reported in 2016 and 2017—and an estimated 76 percent used tin, which was similar to the 69 percent reported in 2017. Overall, an estimated 56 percent reported that they determined whether the minerals were from covered countries, compared with an estimated 49 percent in 2016. Some companies reported taking the same actions to improve supply chain data collection that they had taken in past years, such as using standardized tools and conducting surveys. However, many companies reported difficulties in determining the country of origin, in part as a result of lack of access to suppliers and complex supply chains involving many suppliers and processing facilities. Almost all companies that reported conducting country-of-origin inquiries reported conducting due diligence in their 2018 filings (94 percent). Some companies and industry participants told GAO that the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) revised guidance in April 2017 on specified due diligence disclosure requirements had caused confusion among some suppliers and stakeholders about reporting requirements, sometimes leading suppliers to be reluctant or slow to share information required by companies for their due diligence reporting. In addition, some companies cited the SEC staff's revised guidance as one of the reasons they chose not to file an independent private-sector audit report in 2018. SEC staff said that the guidance is not binding on the commission and that the commission could still initiate enforcement action if companies did not report on due diligence requirements in accordance with the rule. The SEC's long-term regulatory agenda includes an item indicating that the SEC is considering recommendations for the commission to address the effect of litigation over the conflict mineral disclosure rule. According to SEC staff, these recommendations may affect the 2017 guidance pertaining to the rule, which is still in effect, pending review of the rule by the commission. As of June 2019, the rule was on the SECs long- term regulatory agenda, which means that any action would likely not take place until after March 2020. The United Nations reported in 2018 that it had documented 1,049 cases of conflict-related sexual violence against 605 women, 436 girls, four men, and four boys in calendar year 2017 and 32,342 incidents of such violence in conflict-affected provinces between January 2018 and September 2018. UN agencies also reported providing medical assistance to over 5,200 survivors of such sexual violence, and UN Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) reported that it supported legal clinics that provided counseling and referrals to 2,243 civilian survivors of sexual Violence in calendar years 2017 and 2018. In 2019, UN entities, State, USAID, and a USAID-funded program reported additional case-file information about sexual violence that occurred in the Democratic Republicof the Congo and Burundi that occurred between 2017 and 2019.
Drug misuse—the use of illicit drugs and the misuse of prescription drugs—has generally increased in the United States since 2002. In 2018, there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths, up from 23,518 in 2002, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Drug misuse affects people across a range of demographic groups, including people aged 12 or older, income and education levels, employment status, and geographic areas. Past GAO work has found that drug misuse results in high costs for society and the economy, including health care costs, criminal justice costs, workplace productivity costs, education costs, human services costs, and mortality costs. GAO was asked to review the federal government's efforts to address the drug crisis. This report examines (1) trends in drug misuse and overdose deaths since 2002, (2) the negative effects of drug misuse, and (3) challenges that impede national efforts to prevent, respond to, and recover from the crisis. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, guidance, and prior GAO reports; interviewed federal officials; and reviewed selected government and academic studies on drug misuse. Drug misuse is a long-standing national problem that has persisted over decades, despite ongoing federal, state, and local efforts. Federal agencies and Congress can and must work to ensure that available resources are coordinated effectively to mitigate and respond to the drug misuse crisis. Maintaining sustained attention on preventing, responding, and recovering from drug misuse will be challenging in the coming months as many of the federal agencies responsible for addressing drug misuse are currently focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the severe public health and economic effects of the pandemic could fuel some of the contributing factors of drug Misuse—such as unemployment—highlighting the need to sustain drug misuse prevention, response, and recovery efforts. Addressing these challenges will require sustained leadership and strengthened coordination; the necessary capacity to address drug misuse; and the systems to measure, evaluate, and demonstrate progress. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has a responsibility to coordinate and oversee the implementation of the national drug control policy across the government. ONDCP's responsibility to develop the National Drug control Strategy offers the office an important opportunity to help prioritize, coordinate, and measure key efforts to reduce drug misuse across the federal sector. GA O has identified many actions that if taken could help to address challenges in each of these areas, and has made specific recommendations to federal agencies about these actions. While over 25 of these recommendations have been implemented by National Drugcontrol Program agencies since fiscal year 2015, over 60 of GAO's recommendations to at least 10 federal agencies—including recommendations that have received GAO’s highest priority designation—have not yet been implemented as of February 2020. GA o has also identified a number of challenges that have impeded the federal efforts to combat drug misuse including gaps in the capacity of the health care system to treat substance use disorders and gaps in data needed to measure progress. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has not provided guidance to states for the safe care for infants born with prenatal drug exposure, who may be at risk for child abuse and neglect. In addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) does not have a process in place to identify suspicious opioid orders and prevent diversion of prescription opioids to be sold illegally. Without robust assessments of how specific programs help to achieve the goals of the Strategy, federal agencies may be unable to make any needed adjustments to their strategies.
The U.S. government distributes billions of dollars in federal student aid each year to schools participating in student aid programs through the Department of Education's (Education) Higher Education Act and regulations. To help ensure that students receive a quality education, schools must be held accountable for meeting academic standards and meeting financial accountability requirements. GAO was asked to review Education's oversight of the accreditation system. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which Education oversees accreditors' oversight of schools' academic quality and (2) Education's ability to hold schools accountable for student loan default rates. This statement is based on GAO's prior work issued in 2017 and 2018, including selected updates conducted in February and March 2019 on Education's efforts to strengthen its oversight of accreditor oversight. To conduct these updates, GAO analyzed Education data on schools' financial condition, reviewed Education documents, and interviewed Education and accrediting agency officials and other experts. Education is required by law to recognize accredited schools that meet certain criteria and have certain operating procedures in place to be "recognized" by Education as reliable authorities on assessing academic quality. To do so, Education officials and the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI), which advises the Secretary of Education on accreditation issues, review among other things whether an accreditation agency applies its own standards, policies, and procedures when it accredits schools. Education conducts annual reviews of the financial condition of all schools to determine if they are financially responsible. The specific financial responsibility standards that apply to each school depend on the school's ownership type, and Education's financial oversight efforts focus on private nonprofit and for-profit schools. One key financial responsibility standard that Education uses to assess these schools is a financial composite score that is calculated for each school based on items drawn from audited financial statements. The composite score--a metric for evaluating a school's financial condition--uses a formula based on three financial ratios. The formula has not been updated since 1997 and several experts and school officials GAO interviewed identified three key weaknesses in the formula. First, the composite score has not kept pace with changes since 1997 in accounting practices and standards, creating ambiguity and making it more difficult to apply the formula in a uniform manner. Second, the score does not incorporate new financial metrics that would provide a broader indication of schools financial health, such as liquidity (i.e., access to cash) that has become an important financial measure since the 2007-09 economic downturn, when some schools had trouble meeting payroll and contractual obligations. Third, the formula is vulnerable to manipulation by some schools that take on long-term debt (e.g., loans with terms in excess of 12 months) because these debts can increase a schools composite score and help it avoid requirements to post a letter of credit, which could have been used by Education to cover some of the hundreds of millions in student loan discharges resulting from the school’s closure, according to company documents and Education documents and officials. These three weaknesses hamper EducationS ability to effectively fulfill its statutory responsibility to determine whether schools participate in federal programs that provide financial aid. For example, Education is not required to use sanction data or analyze accredator sanctions as part of its accreditation recognition process. Federal internal control standards call for federal agencies to track data to help them make decisions, as well as conduct ongoing, consistent monitoring to identify weaknesses. While GAO has previously reported on a number of challenges with accreditation oversight of academic quality, Education does not use available data to identify potential weaknesses in accredition oversight. For instance, in 2014 GAO reported that Education did not systematically examine data on the number of sanctions issued by accreditation agencies that could have helped it reduce potential risk to students and federal funds. Education agreed with this recommendation and initially started to track sanction data, but has since questioned the usefulness of this information and has not yet used it to inform its discussions of accreditation. In addition, Education has not finalized proposed regulations that would update the formula used to calculate the score, as GAO recommended in its 2017 report, and it has not released a timeline for when it plans to do so. The number of schools that close each year can affect tens of thousands of students and result in financial losses for the federal government and taxpayers from unrepaid student loans. However, Education's score has been an imprecise predictor of school closures, and GAO
In fiscal year 2019, DOL estimated that about 25,700 coal miners received black lung benefits, which include both cash assistance and medical care. The number of beneficiaries could increase in the near term due to the rise in the occurrence of the disease in its most severe form, progressive massive fibrosis, particularly among Appalachian coal miners, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. GAO was asked to review DOL's oversight of coal mine operator self-insurance. This report examines (1) the extent to which self-insured coal mine operators' bankruptcies have affected the Trust Fund, (2) how DOL has overseen coal mine Operator Self-Insurance in the past, and (3) how the Department of Labor (DOL) has implemented a new process for coal mine Operators that should help to address some past deficiencies if implemented effectively. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed DOL data on coal operators that filed for bankruptcy from 2014 through 2016, reviewed DOL documents, and interviewed DOL officials and insurance officials from a nongeneralizable sample of eight coal mine operaters selected to represent a range of industry sectors. Of the eight coal operators GAO reviewed, three transferred an estimated $865 million in estimated benefit liability to the federal government's Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund) during bankruptcy, more than double the amount that DOL had estimated in June 2019. DOL said that the amount of collateral required from these three operators was inadequate to fully cover their estimated benefit liabilities, and benefit liability in excess of the collateral could be transferred to the trust fund. For example, the collateral DOL required from Alpha Coal was about $12 million and approximately $494 million of estimated liability was transferred. The Trust Fund's exposure to financial risk could increase as a result of these three bankruptcies. The three other bankruptcies GAO identified did not transfer benefit liability from the coal operators, and DOL does not know how these bankruptcies may affect the Trust fund. In July 2019, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs within DOL began implementing a new self- insurance process that, if effectively implemented, should help address some of these past deficiencies. Specifically, the new process plans to consider an operator's future benefit liability when setting collateral and plans to review self- insured operators more frequently. However, the process still lacks procedures for coal operator renewals and coal operator appeals, which could hinder DOL from taking enforcement actions to protect the Trust Funds as needed. Additionally, Dol does not monitor whether operators that do not self- insure maintain adequate and continuous commercial insurance coverage as required by law. In the absence of effective DOL monitoring of operator compliance with insurance requirements, uninsured operators could pose a potential risk to the black lung program. In examining the 13 largest coal operators (parent or subsidiary) that were not insured for the entire 3-year period from 2016 through 2018, we found that some insurers erred in reporting endorsements and in one instance an operator did not have adequate coverage. In addition, one of these six operators inadvertently had, inadvertently, not maintained adequate commercial coverage for its mining operations in Texas, and had not selfinsured those operations. In this instance, the operator obtained an excess loss policy that only pays claims once they exceed a high threshold and, therefore, is not sufficient by itself to secure the payment of the operator's benefit liabilities.
GAO was asked to review the time frames for finalizing construction contract changes. GAO examined (1) factors that affect the time it takes to finalize contract changes at selected agencies, and (2) the extent to which selected agencies monitor time frames. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant legislation, regulations, guidance, and agency policies and procedures, and interviewed officials at the Department of Defense (DOD), the General Services Administration (GSA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). GAO also collected and analyzed data on contract changes from January 2013 through August 2018 at USACE, GSA, and the Public Buildings Service (PBS). A variety of factors affect how long it takes for agencies to process contract changes, including the time needed for making a change determination, creating a cost estimate, identifying funds, negotiating with the contractor, completing reviews, and processing the change. For example, a majority of contract changes were finalized in fewer than 60 days, and a little more than 3 percent took more than 1 year. The construction contract change process includes a number of steps that can factor into finalizing a contract change, depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding an individual change, such as obtaining a complete proposal from the contractor with sufficient information on cost and schedule changes to begin negotiations. Agency contracting officials at both PBS and USACE note that some of these procedural steps are necessary to protect the government's interests—which includes negotiating a fair and reasonable price for the work related to the change, among other things. However, these steps can add time to the process. In prior GAO work, industry concerns, and recent congressional action, including a provision in the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, have raised concerns about the timeliness of certain contract changes and the potential impact on project schedules and costs. The Federal Procurement Data System – Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data show that the time required for a construction contract to be finalized varies by agency, but that the majority of changes from 2013 through 2018 were finalized within 60 days; however, a smaller percentage took substantially longer. Approximately 45 percent of the completed contract changes in USACE's construction contract system took over 60 days to complete, and about 3 percent of those changes took over 1 year to complete. USACE officials stated that they do not routinely collect and review this information at the headquarters level due to the manual process required to compile the data and perform calculations, but they are in the early stages of planning for a system upgrade that they hope will automate the process of compiling and analyzing the data. While the amount of information on contract change information varies between USACE and PBS, neither agency regularly monitors contract change time frames, as required by federal standards for internal control. Without regular monitoring, contracting officials may be unable to spot potential problems—such as long process times that affect project schedules—as they occur and respond accordingly.
GSA leases office space on behalf of the federal government in thousands of leased buildings and warehouses that cost billions of dollars annually to rent, operate, and maintain. GSA's leasing staff has decreased by over 50 percent since the late 1990s, from over 800 personnel to less than 400 in 2019, and GSA relies on brokers to deliver leased space to federal agencies. GAO was asked to review the broker program. This report examines (1) the extent to which GSA has changed its broker program to allow greater flexibility in its use of brokers and (2) how GSA measures the effectiveness of using brokers to supplement its leasing workforce. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant GSA documents and interviewed GSA officials and representatives from a nongeneralizable sample of six GSA regional offices selected based on geographic location, among other factors. The General Services Administration (GSA) has made changes to its leasing program in recent years to allow more brokers to participate and to increase its flexibility in using brokers. In 2015, GSA changed the program's name to the GSA Leasing Support Services program (GLS) and moved from using four brokers on a nationwide basis to designating brokers within four geographical zones. In early 2020, the agency plans to announce the brokers that will be involved in the fourth iteration of the program. In this iteration, called GLS Plus, the zones and number of brokers within each zone will remain the same. Brokers are used primarily for high-to-moderate value leases, which are leases that GSA typically does not have enough staff to complete on its own. According to GSA, brokers are more successful at negotiating lower lease rates relative to the market than GSA in-house staff and using brokers provides savings to the government. For example, in fiscal year 2018, 56 percent of the leases negotiated by brokers were below the market rate compared to 38 percent of leases that were negotiated by GSA staff. However, there are various factors, including the type of lease that may account for these differences, such as local market areas, that affect rental rates in federal leases, and it is difficult to determine whether these differences are due to having brokers involved as opposed to the characteristics of the lease themselves. Furthermore, three real estate economists GAO interviewed indicated that real-estate sale prices and rental rates are driven primarily by competitive market forces and thus would not be heavily influenced by broker negotiation. The broker program's primary goal is to save the government money, but GSA does not currently use its own appropriated funds to compensate brokers for services performed as a part of this program. Instead, it relies on federal tenant agencies to pay brokers a percentage of the total commission that goes back to the federal tenant agency in the form of a reduction in rent, which can result in lower costs for tenant agencies. In contrast, several lessors (property owners) said that when GSA uses brokers to negotiate leases, broker commissions have to be paid by the lessor and that this cost is ultimately passed on to federal-agency-tenant clients. Over the years and with different iterations of the brokers program, GSA has established various goals for the program, most of which pertain to cost savings. For the next iteration, which is scheduled to start in mid-2020, the proposed goals include achieving taxpayer savings, improving the customer experience, and leveraging broker expertise. In addition, in April 2019, GsA developed a model to project, on average, the number of hours a broker saves the agency's lease-contracting officer and project manager over a 3-year period and multiplied this savings by the hourly salary of GSA leasing personnel to generate a reported personnel savings of $3 million per year. However the model provides limited information to help GSA understand the overall benefits of the broker Program as a workforce multiplier. Specifically, this goal does not demonstrate if brokers are completing leases more efficiently or if they are completing an additional number of leases on an annual basis, for example, or if GSA is missing opportunities to reduce its expiring lease inventory and right-size leases with rental square footage reductions. In response to GAO's prior work, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) creates a framework for articulating unified goals and outcome measures that can provide federal agencies with a clear direction for successful implementation of program activities and improve the efficiency and accountability of agencies' efforts. However GSA lacks outcome-based metrics that
The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for maritime safety and security, environmental protection, and national security, among other missions, in the Arctic region. As more navigable ocean water has emerged in the region and human activity increases, the Coast Guard has faced, and will continue to face, expanding Arctic responsibilities. The Coast Guard's polar icebreaking fleet—a critical component of its Arctic mission—includes two icebreakers, the Polar Star and Healy. The Polar Star is currently the only active polar icebreaker in the U. S. Arctic. The Healy is a medium icebreaker that primarily supports Arctic research, and while it is capable of carrying out a wide range of activities, it cannot ensure timely access to some Arctic areas in the winter given that it does not have the icebreaking capabilities of a heavy icebreaker. In November 2018, Coast Guard Assistant Commandant for Acquisition testified that the current polar icebreakers provide minimal capacity to carry out current icebreaking missions and that the nation must take swift action to rebuild and enhance this critical national capability. GAO was asked to testify on the status of Coast Guard Arctic capability gaps. This testimony is based on GAO's September 2018 report on the Polar Security Cutter program ( GAO-2019-10-854 ) and its June 2016 report on Arctic capabilities gaps (GAO-16-631R ). For that work, GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents and interviewed Coast Guard officials. In September 2018 GAO found that the Coast Coast Guard did not have a sound business case when it established the acquisition baselines for the polar security cutter program in March 2018 due to risks in four key areas: technology, design, cost, and schedule. The program's cost estimate that informed the program's $9.8 billion cost baseline--which includes life cycle costs for the acquisition, operations, and maintenance of three polar icebreak ships--substantially met GAO best practices for being comprehensive, well-documented, and accurate. However, the estimate only partially met best practices to be credible because it did not quantify the range of possible costs over the entire life of the program, such as the period of operations and support. As a result, the cost estimate was not fully reliable and may underestimate the total funding needed for the program. In June 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Coast Guard assessed its capability to perform its Arctic missions in fiscal year 2012 and identified various capability gaps, including the lack of a communications architecture, limited icebreaking capacity, a limited pool of Arctic-trained and experienced Coast Guard personnel, and limited training, exercise, and educational opportunities to enhance Arctic skills among Coast Guard staff. In addition, the agency did not systematically assess how its actions helped to mitigate these gaps, which is critical to its understanding of its progress towards addressing these gaps. As GAO recommended in June 2016 that Coast Guard (1) develop measures for assessing its progress and (2) design and implement a process to systematically assess its progress on this. DHS concurred with these recommendations and has taken steps to address them. As of January 2020, the program has not yet taken action to implement these recommendations. The Arctic region has increased in strategic importance in recent years, and with the increase comes more responsibility for the Coast guard. The agency has emphasized that as the Arctic continues to open and strategic competition drives more actors to look to the Arctic for economic and geopolitical advantages, the demand for Coast Guard leadership and presence in the area will grow. As it embarks on the acquisition of its new polar ice breakers, it faces a number of key acquisition risks. For example, in December 2019 GAO reported that the contract delivery date for the lead ship, May 2024, is 2 months after the delivery date in its schedule baseline. In response to GAO recommendations that the program develop a realistic schedule, including delivery dates, and determine schedule risks during the construction phase, and update its schedule to reflect these risks, the Program Office is now tracking additional schedule risks and is updating its program schedule.
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is responsible for buying and distributing about 5 million distinct consumable, expendable, and reparable items annually to meet the logistics requirements of the U.S. armed forces for food, clothing, fuel, spare parts, and other items. DLA's reverse engineering efforts are intended to identify new sources for parts that are no longer needed, such as those that are obsolete or those supplied by only one source. Reverse engineering is the process of replicating a design by physically examining and measuring an existing item to develop the technical data necessary to reproduce the item functionally and dimensionally. GAO was asked to review DLA reverse engineering programs. This report examines (1) the number of reverse engineering projects initiated by DLA during fiscal years 2015 through 2018 and (2) the extent to which DLA has processes in place to protect intellectual property during reverse engineering. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed DLA data on projects initiated and completed during this period and interviewed DLA officials and representatives from a nongeneralizable sample of 10 small businesses involved in DLA-funded and contractor-funded reverse engineering activities. GA O provided a draft of this report to DOD for review. DOD had no comments. The Department of Defense (DOD) initiated over 1,600 Reverse Engineered Spare Parts (Reverse Engineering) projects in its Aviation, Land and Maritime, and Troop Support major subordinate commands from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2018. These projects were intended to develop technical data needed for future competitive procurements of spare parts. The reverse engineering of these spare parts resulted in some reduced prices and increased supplier opportunities for small businesses. For example, in one project GAO reviewed, a small business successfully reverse engineered a retaining ring, which assists in securing parts in an aircraft engine and became a new approved source of supply. A subsequent purchase of this part resulted in a unit price that was almost $70 lower per unit compared to the most recent purchase before reverse engineering, saving DOD over $11,000. According to DOD data, the agency saved at least $22 million from these projects initiated from fiscal years2015 through 2018 as a result of lower prices paid. The Army Corps of Engineers, DLA, and small businesses GAO spoke with generally stated that reverse engineering is generally beneficial to small businesses because it provides opportunities for additional business with DLA. In addition, industry associations GAO met with stated thatreverse engineering is a way to involve small business and provide opportunities to become qualified suppliers and compete for future DLA contracts. We found that DLA processes generally safeguard intellectual property in reverse engineering during these efforts. Of the 10 small business representatives that were involved with GAO's 19 selected projects, none of the representatives identified concerns with the protection of intellectual property. Although the standard operating procedure for reverse engineering applies to both DLA and contractor funded efforts, the provisions that safeguard against patent infringement are specific to the contractor funded program. These provisions state that patented materials should not be approved or shared for reverseengineering. However, for contractor- funded efforts under the Replenishment Parts Purchase or Borrow program, DOD officials stated that they physically review parts for patent marks, and if a patent is found, the project is stopped. For the other DLA efforts, officials stated they physically reviewed parts for patents, but did not check for patents under this program because they are supplying parts for legacy systems, which are typically 20 years or older.
In 1993, Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) to increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in federal elections, as well as to protect the integrity of the electoral process and ensure accurate and current voter registration rolls. The Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces the NVRA and other federal laws that protect the right to vote, such as the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, among others. GAO was asked to review issues related to federal election fraud. This report examines, among other things, (1) DOJ's efforts to enforce and address election fraud from fiscal years 2001 through 2017; (2) how selected data sources are used at the state and local level to identify and remove registrants from voter registration lists; and (3) perspectives on how these sources help maintain registration lists. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, reports, and other documents and interviewed officials from DOJ, five states, and ten local jurisdictions selected based on geographic location and other factors. DOJ, the U.S. Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Election Assistance Commission, the Crosscheck program, and election offices in the five states and 10 local jurisdictions GAO visited provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. DOJ's Voting Section has the authority to initiate a matter or pursue a case under theNVRA, among the other voting laws for which it is responsible. The Voting Section initiated matters, filed cases, and participated as an amicus curiae or “friend of the court” in cases related to NVRA provisions related to voter registration opportunities (registration opportunities) and list maintenance (removal of ineligible voters from registration lists under specified conditions). GAO found that the Voting Section filed more NVRA-related matters and cases than matters related to list maintenance and registration opportunities from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2017. For example, the Section initiated the most registration opportunity matters in fiscal years 2008 (13), 2011 (10), and 2013 (7). The Section did not initiate any list maintenance matters in some years, and initiated between one and four in other years. DOJ entered into five out-of-court settlement agreements with states (in lieu of filing a case) to address allegations of NVRA non-compliance between fiscal year 2008 and 2017. All five of the agreements were related to the law's registration opportunity provisions. According to DOJ officials, amicus participation increased between fiscal years 2012 and 2017 in part because it was a way for the Section to participate in cases in a manner which did not require a significant amount of resources. Specifically, officials stated that filing amicus brief takes considerably less time and fewer staff resources than litigating a case. The six data sources GAO examined are used to identify registrants who have moved, died, or have a disqualifying criminal conviction. State election officials GAO interviewed said that the use of these data sources helps improve voter registration list accuracy, despite some limitations. Officials from all five states said that they use the data to identify individuals who have potentially moved and may have moved outside of the jurisdiction, who are deceased, or who have been convicted of a felony. Officials also noted that the data can be useful for identifying registrants whose moves are not captured by other data sources such as state vital records data, which are used by election officials to identify deceased registrants and remove them from the registration list. In addition, officials said that data from the National Change of Address (NCOA) database, which contains change of address information for individuals, families, and businesses who have filed for a change of residence with the Postal Service and other sources, can be used to confirm that a registrant has moved. However, election officials noted that NCOA data may inaccurately indicate that registrants moved unless election officials conduct additional work to verify the information. The Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program (Crosscheck) is an interstate data sharing program that compares participating states' voter registration data against one another. Crosscheck results for potential duplicate registrations are based on a match of the first name, last name, and date of birth and may also include additional information—such as registrants' middle name, suffixes, registration address, and Social Security number, if available—which election officials can use to help determine whether a
Medicaid, a joint federal-state health care financing program for low-income and medically needy individuals, is a significant component of federal and state budgets. In fiscal year 2017, the federal government provided about $460 billion in federal funds to states for Medicaid and related programs, including about $200 billion for demonstrations, which allow states to test new policies and procedures, such as work requirements, in a bid to attract and retain Medicaid enrollees. GAO was asked to review states' efforts to implement work requirements. This report examines (1) how states designed work requirements under demonstrations, (2) the administrative costs states have incurred to implement these requirements, and (3) the extent to which the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees states' administrative costs. To do this work, GAO selected five states—Kentucky, Indiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin—based on factors such as the number of Medicaid beneficiaries subject to work requirements and number of states with approved work requirements as of May 2019. These five states were selected based on a number of factors, including the number and type of demonstrations they had in place at the time of GAO's review, among other factors. To obtain additional information on administrative costs, these states provided GAO with documents related to their work requirements that GAO obtained from CMS. States' work requirements varied in terms of the beneficiary groups subject to the requirements; the required activities; and the consequences beneficiaries face if they do not meet requirements. For example, four of the five selected states required adults under the age of 50 to complete 80 hours of work or other qualifying activities per month, while five states required beneficiaries to report each month on hours worked using methods approved by the state such as online or over the phone. In addition, eight of the nine states that received approval for work requirements also received approval under their demonstrations for other beneficiary requirements such as requiring beneficiaries to have expenditure accounts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) does not consider administrative costs when approving any demonstrations—including those with work requirements—though these costs can be significant. The agency has recently taken steps to obtain more information about demonstration administrative costs and has issued guidance on monitoring and evaluating demonstrations, but GAO identified various weaknesses in CMS's oversight of administrative costs that could result in states receiving federal funds for costs that are not allowable or at higher matching rates than is appropriate. In some cases, states received CMS approval for planned administrative costs while in others it was unclear whether CMS would have identified the issues through their oversight procedures. Areas of risk included funds for planned information technology (IT) costs, funds for beneficiary supports, and funds provided under managed care contracts that may not be allowable or eligible for higher match rates. For instance, Kentucky received approval to spend $192.6 million in federal funding for its $220.9 million in expected IT costs over 2 years to implement its work requirements in fiscal year 2019, an effective match rate of 87 percent. However, CMS's 2018 guidance states that Medicaid funding is not available to finance beneficiary supports such as job training or other employment services. CMS officials said that the agency did not review the contract and approved the request based on Kentucky's assertion that these costs were specific to technology. Indiana and New Hampshire also received funding approval for federal IT funds at the 90 percent matching rate for IT costs that do not appear eligible for that rate. In 2018, CMS approved Indiana's request for a 90 percent match rate to pay $500,000 in consulting fees to develop work requirement policies, despite CMS guidance indicating that policy research and development activities should be matched at 50 percent. New Hampshire requested and received approval in 2018 for federal funds at a 90-percent match rate for $180,000 to educate beneficiaries about work requirements; however, CMS officials told GAO that federal review had not been completed as of June 2019 and could not make a definitive statement. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving program objectives (in this case, ensuring that administrative expenditures under demonstrations are allowable and matched at the correct rate). Without identifying, assessing, and addressing the risks posed by demonstrations that may increase administrative costs—and therefore overall Medicaid spending—CMS is not factoring these costs into its approval decisions, which is counter to the agency's goals of transparency and budget neutrality.
In 2017, the Army established Army Futures Command to focus its modernization efforts on developing new weapon systems and preparing for the future. GAO was asked to examine how small businesses that support research and development efforts could be affected by the establishment of this new command. This report (1) describes what analyses the Army conducted to determine the effect of its modernization initiatives on small businesses; (2) describes how Army Futured Command is engaging with small businesses to support research efforts and assesses how it is coordinating with other Army organizations; and (3) assesses the command's plans to track and measure the performance of its engagement with these small businesses. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Army documents and interviewed officials from Army offices, organizations transitioning to the new command, and two private sector entities the Army has coordinated with for outreach to small businesses, among other things. The Army did not conduct analyses specific to small business, but it stated it considers small business engagement important to its modernization effort. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology and Army Contracting Command, which is the principle buying agent and provider of contracting support for the Army, provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. In October 2017, in response to a mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) established a new command within the Army—Army Futures command—to focus its efforts on new weapon system modernization. The command is expected to become fully operational in July 2019, when its headquarters and its subordinate components are fully staffed. As part of this, the command established a Directorate of Operations at headquarters to facilitate integration of command activities across components, which would include those related to smallbusiness engagement. Federal internal control standards state that when establishing an organizational structure management should consider how organizations across and outside of it interact in order to fulfill their overall responsibilities. This includes establishing reporting lines and roles and responsibilities within and outside the organization as they relate to smallBusiness engagement. The new command is taking steps to engage with small business entities, but is not fully leveraging existing relevant Army expertise. For example, Army Future Command has not fully engaged the organizations that transitioned to the command in terms of small business research efforts, such as the Army's Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs, or its subordinate command Army Research Laboratory, which has years of experience working with smallbusiness entities on research efforts. According to officials from these organizations, these efforts have historically led to business relationships using a variety of arrangements, including contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and cooperative research agreements. However, these arrangements are not generally tracked in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation database, and the data for this reporting does not distinguish business size. As a result, the data cannot be used to quantify the Armys engagement with small Business under this arrangement. Army Futuring Command officials told GAO that they have not prioritized tracking small business activities because they have focused on establishing the command and engaging with businesses as quickly as possible to identify innovative solutions. By tracking its small business activity, the Command would have a more comprehensive understanding of the various efforts underway across the command. Tracking such information would also allow the command to make adjustments to those efforts to ensure it obtains the innovative input from small businesses the command has stated it needs to achieve its modernization goals. The Command also has not yet established performance measures for evaluating the effectiveness of its efforts to engage small businesses and has not developed a plan to systematically assess these efforts. Command officials said they are in the process of considering various measures to do so, but have not yet determined which specific measures, if any, they will use and have no time frame to establish these measures. Establishing performance measures and developing a plan for systematically assessing its efforts would help ensure the command is not missing opportunities to make informed management and investment decisions for its research anddevelopment efforts.
The U.S. pipeline system consists of more than 2.7 million miles of networked pipelines transporting natural gas, oil, and other hazardous liquids. Pipeline accidents can occur from a variety of causes, including third-party excavation, corrosion, mechanical failure, control system failure, and operator error. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), within the Department of Transportation (DOT), share responsibility for protecting the nation's pipeline systems. GAO was asked to review TSA's and PHMSA's roles and responsibilities for pipeline safety and security. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which the agencies have reviewed the 2006 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Pipeline Security and Safety that delineates their roles and responsibility, and (2) how the agencies communicate their respective roles to pipeline operators and stakeholders. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant documents, such as the 2006 MOU and TSA's Pipeline Security Guidelines and Incident Recovery Protocol Plan, and interviewed agency and industry officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Energy's (DOE) Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have noted various developments that have occurred since 2006 that may affect their roles for pipeline security. For example, the establishment of the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) in November 2018. CISA, formerly the DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate, is responsible for coordinating a national effort to secure and protect against critical infrastructure risks. These responsibilities include coordinating with sector-specific agencies to carry out its cybersecurity and critical infrastructure activities. However, the MOU Annex has not been updated since its inception in 2006 to consider incorporating these changes which includes subsequently issued presidential directives, and distinctions between current TSA inspection operations. As a result, the agreement is not current and may not fully reflect the agencies' pipeline security and safety-related activities. TSA officials stated that they do not believe that CISA impacts TSA's roles for identifying pipeline critical infrastructure. While CISA may or may not have impacts on TSA's pipeline security roles, reviewing the annex in light of new developments would allow the agencies to determine whether updates are necessary. By developing and implementing mutually agreed upon time frames for reviewing and updating the annex, as appropriate, the agencies could better ensure that the agreement consistently reflects relevant and updated information on their roles. TSA has established a Pipeline Incident Response Protocol Plan to establish a comprehensive interagency approach to counter risks, coordinate federal agencies' actions, and minimize the consequences of incidents involving pipeline infrastructure as well as recovery time from them. TSA issued the plan in 2010, but has not updated it to reflect changes in federal laws and policies since that time. Specifically, TSA's 2010 plan states that it will be updated periodically to address changes in pipeline security threats, technology, and federal law and policy. TSA also has not reviewed or revised its 2010 plan to ensure it addresses changes in at least three key areas: cybersecurity-related laws and policy, incident management policies, and DHS's terrorism alert system. By periodically reviewing and revising the plan, TSA would better ensure the plan addresses all possible and relevant threats to pipeline systems and fully incorporates relevant changes. By doing so, TSA could provide greater assurance that federal agencies understand the actions they are to take to prevent, respond to, or recover from a physical or cyber incident.
VHA primarily uses the SAIL system to assess and compare the performance of medical centers. Veterans can also view SAIL data to compare medical center performance when making health care decisions. Officials from the networks and medical centers in GAO's review expressed concerns about how SAIL is being used and whether star ratings are an accurate reflection of medical center quality. GAO was asked to review VHA's process for assessing medical center directors' performance. This report examines (1) the extent to which VHA uses SAIL and its associated star ratings to assess medical center health care performance, and (2) how VHA assesses the results of previous evaluations of SAIL to ensure the system's effectiveness. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed VHA documents and interviewed officials from VHA, its network, and medical center offices. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) primarily uses its Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning (SAIL) system, which includes 29 performance measures to assess the quality, efficiency, and productivity of the nation's health care system's medical centers, and the associated Star Ratings of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) as an assessment of overall quality, to assess each medical center's performance. SAIL documentation states that the goal of the star ratings is for low-performing medical centers to learn from the best practices of high-performing ones, although all medical centers have the opportunity to improve. For example, a medical center that initially received a 5-star rating will be reduced to a 4- star rating if it has a high mortality rate. In addition, VHA officials told GAO they can decide to increase a 1-star medical center’s rating if the medical center outperforms the bottom 10 percent of U.S. hospitals in certain criteria as measured by external systems such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Hospital Compare website. VHA relies heavily on medical center information to assess its network and medicalCenter directors’ performance. In fiscal year 2018, medical center results comprised 25 percent of the overall rating and included measures such as patient mortality, length of stay, and readmissions. Medical center performance information is also used when assessing directors‘ performance across other appraisal elements, such as suicide prevention initiatives. However, there are other considerations in the performance assessment process that may result in directors receiving a rating that is higher than that indicated by the star rating of the medical Center. In its December 2016 review of human resource management practices at VHA (GAO-17-30 ), GAO found that the release of VHAs performance plan template is often delayed, which can limit its effectiveness as a means of assessing directors performance. Specifically, in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, the template was released to network directors in November or December, close to the end of the first quarter of the performance appraisal period. Directors at two medical centers expressed frustration with the delay and not having a full year to meet performance expectations, but directors at the two other medical centers stated that they find the process clear and are able to anticipate performance expectations. VA partially concurred with this recommendation and has made limited progress in implementing it. As of December 2018, this recommendation remains open and GAO reiterates the need for VHA to implement it. Although SAIL has been used in the assessment of both medical centersas a tool for measuring performance and fostering accountabilityVHA officials have not assessed and implemented as appropriate the recommendations from previous evaluations to ensure its effectiveness. This is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control, which state that management should remediate identified internal control deficiencies on a timely basis. This remediation may include assessing results of reviews to determine appropriate actions, and, once decisions are made, completing and documenting corrective actions. VA officials told us that since SAIL was established in 2012, there have been two evaluations of the system. The first evaluation was an internal review, which was completed in February 2014 and reviewed by the then Under Secretary for Health and Principle Deputy Under-Secretary for Health. The internal review found issues related to SAILsuch as the validity and reliability of star ratingsand included a recommendation that VHA no longer use aggregate star ratings for accountability, or for presenting quality and efficiency information to stakeholders. The second evaluation, an external review, was conducted in April 2015 and included 19 recommendations for short- and long-term improvements to
The federal government relies on evidence to inform its decision-making, and GAO's prior work has identified long-standing challenges in generating some sources of evidence. GAO was asked to review the coordination of federal evidence-building activities. This report (1) describes activities selected agencies have taken that align with congressional and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) direction to strengthen evidence- building, and (2) examines the extent to which selected agencies' processes for assessing and prioritizing evidence needs reflect leading practices for collaboration. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials at five selected agencies: the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor; the Corporation for National and Community Service; and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The five agencies were selected based on their experiences incorporating evidence-based approaches into program design and implementation, such as pay for success projects, performance partnerships, and tiered evidence grants, among other things. The selected agencies varied in size—as measured by budget authority and employees—and organizational structure. For example, the Department of Labor's Workforce Innovation Fund, established in 2011, provided funding to projects that proposed new and untested approaches, with little or no evidence of effectiveness; those with promising approaches that were tested and existing evidence suggested could be effective; and those that adapted proven approaches, supported by ample and robust evidence. Agencies' processes to assess the sufficiency of their existing evidence—conducted via processes for their strategic reviews—reflect the four leading collaboration practices GAO has identified in its prior work. For instance, Education officials looked across the agency and leveraged existing evidence generated by different organizational units to better understand program performance. Had this not occurred, Education might have collected data that duplicated what was already generated by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Agencies also use a variety of processes to prioritize new evidence to generate. Agency officials told GAO that much of this prioritization takes place at lower organizational levels, with component agencies generally leading their own processes through which they prioritize evidence. Officials at each of the selected agencies identified one or more processes intended to coordinate the prioritization of evidence needs across the entire organization. These processes can help agencies ensure they are comprehensively and systematically looking across their organizations to leverage existing evidence and focus limited resources on building new evidence. They can also help ensure agencies are well positioned to meet forthcoming Evidence Act requirements to assess and prioritize evidence across the whole agency.
Federal agencies' fleets consist of many types of vehicles that support a variety of purposes, such as transporting staff and gear to remote, off-road locations to perform maintenance or perform other tasks. In recent years, Congress and several administrations have required federal agencies to take various steps to reduce petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions in their fleets. In May 2018, the Trump administration revoked an Executive Order that had required agencies to acquire electric vehicles and reduce per-mile emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and 50 percent by 2025. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' efforts to meet fleet energy requirements. This report addresses: (1) how agencies meet energy requirements and how their efforts changed fleets and (2) challenges federal agencies faced related to furthering fleet energy goals. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Automotive Statistical Tool database on the composition and fuel use of federal fleets from fiscal years 2008 through 2017, the most current data available at the time of GAO's review; surveyed 29 federal agencies; and interviewed fleet managers at five case study agencies selected to represent different sizes, alternative fuel vehicle types, and missions with varying vehicle needs. The majority of agencies subject to federal-fleet energy requirements reported meeting most requirements for fiscal year 2017 by changing the mix of vehicles acquired and improving fleet management. Specifically, agencies credited acquiring low greenhouse-gas-emitting and alternative fuel vehicles for helping to reduce their per- mile greenhouse gas emission and petroleum use. Agencies also described improving their fleet management in other ways such as removing unnecessary vehicles and reducing miles traveled in order to meet these requirements. For example, the Department of Energy (DOE) reported that agencies were more successful in reducing the number and size of sedans and sport-utility vehicles than the number or size of their larger vehicles. In spite of agencies' reported general success in meeting energy requirements, several challenges may hinder agencies' further progress towards the goals of reducing federal fleets' petroleum and greenhouse- gas emissions. First, although acquiring electric and hybrid vehicles could help agencies meet the current goals, costs can be prohibitive. Second, a lack of fuel and infrastructure availability limits agencies' use of alternative fuel, specifically E85. Third, agency officials GAO interviewed stated that a continuing need for larger vehicles to perform certain tasks limits the number of low greenhouse gas vehicles agencies can acquire—and thus the potential for further progress in reducing petroleum use in federal fleets. According to GSA data, in fiscal year 2018, federal agencies acquired about 85 percent of their fleets of vehicles was comprised of sport-UTility vehicles, passenger vans, and passenger vans and trucks. In addition, while agencies have acquired some electric vehicles, the number has remained very small—consisting of just over 1,000 plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles in 2017. Finally, according to agency officials, there are not enough low- greenhouse gas vehicle options to ensure fleet managers can meet mission goals and vehicle acquisition requirements.
Confucius Institutes are entities that seek to promote Chinese language and culture in foreign countries. The first Confucius Institute in the United States was established in 2004, and there were approximately 525 institutes worldwide as of September 2018, according to Hanban's website. In recent years, some U.S. universities have partnered with Chinese universities to establish degree-granting institutions in China approved by the country's government. In August 2016, GAO reported that the 12 universities GAO reviewed generally reported receiving support from their Chinese partner universities and from Chinese government entities, with limited funding from U. S. government agencies and private donors. GAO was asked to update its August 2016 report. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which the 12 colleges and universities in GAO's review have agreements and policies that protect academic freedom and academic standards, (2) views on the benefits, concerns, and suggestions for improvement of the institutions' management, operations, and agreements, and (3) perspectives on concerns related to the institutes. This statement is based on a report GAO issued in February 2019 (GAO-2019-10-852R). To conduct this review, GA O reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the 12 schools, researchers, and other stakeholders, including Chinese government officials and officials from Hanban, the Chinese government-backed entity that oversees the establishment of institutes in China. In February 2019, we reported that GAO found that 12 universities that we reviewed were established as a partnership between a U.s. school and a Chinese college or university, funded and arranged in part by Hanban. At the time of our review, the 12 institutions we reviewed ranged from fewer than 40 to more than 3,000 students, and more than 90 percent of the students across the institutions were Chinese, and less than 6 percent were American citizens. The 12 universities in our review reported receiving a variety of benefits, such as grants for land, resources, and facilities. For example, one university reported receiving nearly 500 acres of land and a commitment from the Chinese provincial and local governments to spend about $240 million for construction and development of facilities. In addition, five of the universities reported receiving federal funding, which in most cases consisted of federal financial aid to American students. In our February 2019 report, we also found that most universities included language in their written agreements or other policies that either embodied a protection of academic freedom or indicated that the institution in China will adhere to academic standards commensurate with those at their U.N. campus. In general, university officials and students GAO interviewed in China generally reported that academic freedom had not been restricted. However, we found that some conditions specific to Chinese students may constrain their academic experience, including self-censorship and the possibility that their Chinese classmates may be government or Communist Party monitors who will report on whatever the students say. We also observed that three universities we reviewed that were approved by China's Ministry of Education as having independent legal status shared characteristics that may be correlated with greater academic and other freedoms on campus. These three universities had campuses built specifically for the joint institution that were located relatively far away from their joint institution, generally controlled their own day-to-day operations, had uncensored internet access, and offered extensive campus and student life programs. In contrast, the other nine universities we review did not consistently share these characteristics at the time we reviewed. We found that students and faculty at these universities sometimes faced challenges teaching, conducting research, and completing coursework because of restrictions on internet access and other factors. We reported in August 2016 that additional factors that could create obstacles to learning at U. s. universities in China include self- censorship and constraints specific to China's students, including restrictions on the use of the internet and restrictions on students' freedom of speech and assembly.
The Mérida Initiative is intended to address serious challenges to security and the rule of law in Mexico. State/INL and USAID are the lead U.S. agencies for the initiative. In fiscal years 2014 through 2018, the two agencies allocated about $542 million for a total of 445 projects. GAO was asked to review the implementation of the initiative and monitoring of these projects. This report (1) examines the extent to which State follows key practices in monitoring these projects and tracks project performance data against established measures, (2) examines USAID's monitoring practices, and (3) describes how State uses data from the Government of Mexico to monitor the initiative's implementation. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 15 high-dollar value projects that started between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, and five high–dollar value USAID projects, selected based on their high dollar value and other factors, and interviewed officials from State, USAID, the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and Homeland Security and the Department of Justice (DOD), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Washington, D.C., and Mexico City. The Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (State/INl) generally followed key practices for monitoring foreign assistance projects in the areas of assigning monitoring duties to qualified staff, planning a monitoring approach, and monitoring project implementation about half of the time. For example, State generally required that staff responsible for monitoring projects be certified as authorized, trained, and authorized (COR, GOR, or AOR), and assigned roles and responsibilities to monitoring staff through a designation letter in which a contract or agreement officer designates a COR or AO to oversee each project. However, for two of the five projects GAO examined, State did not maintain documentation showing that it assigned monitoring staff with appropriate certifications. In addition, for one project, State could not provide documentation demonstrating that monitoring staff had generally conducted site or field monitoring visits or taken other steps to validate the partner's performance implementing the project. State also did not consistently track performance data for four of the 15 projects reviewed. For two of these four projects, State tracked performance data in quarterly progress reports, but did so inconsistently for the other two projects. For these two projects, the performance measures reflected outputs, such as the number of survey pollsters hired and trained and the percentage of forensic laboratories trainees reporting improved knowledge of subject matter. For the remaining five projects, however, State's monitoring plans did not address identified risks, which could help the agency allocate monitoring resources to those aspects of the projects that warrant closer scrutiny. According to USAID officials, the agency conducted periodic portfolio reviews to ensure monitoring staff adequately monitored projects and that they followed key monitoring practices. State officials said they plan to continue adding data for past and present projects in 2020. The Government ofMexico shares indicator data with State to help monitor the implementation and activities of the MérIDA Initiative, including which best practices can be replicated across Mexico.
The United States has maintained a cooperative relationship with North Macedonia since the country gained its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. In 2011, the United States and the European Union (EU) assessed that North Macedonia's conservative party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization–Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (known as VMRO-DPMNE, or VMRO), was consolidating political power and increasing its control over the judiciary, Parliament, media, civil society, and local government. In February 2015, the leader of the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM), the main opposition party, began releasing phone conversations allegedly recorded by the government's counterintelligence service that revealed widespread corruption and state capture by the ruling party, triggering a political crisis. The four main political parties agreed to, among other things, hold free and fair elections by the end of April 2016. The parties reached agreement on a number of key reforms and set the conditions for parliamentary elections that took place on December 11, 2016, without a clear majority winner. Although SDSM leader Zoran Zaev formed a majority coalition in February 2017, then-President Ivanov refused to give Zaev the mandate to form a new government until May 2017, following a violent storming of Parliament by hundreds of protesters in April. The new coalition government expressed support for North Macedonia’s accession to the EU and membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In February 2019, North Macedonia formally changed its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, ending a longstanding dispute over its name with Greece, which had for years exercised its veto power in NATO to block its membership. The U.S. government recognized the name change on February 15, 2019. GAO was asked to review democracy assistance in North Macedonia. This report examines (1) funding for democracy assistance to North Macedonia in fiscal years 2012 through 2017 and (2) the extent to which USAID adhered to relevant operational policies in selecting recipients of democracy assistance. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed award data and documentation for a sample of 13 grants and cooperative agreements that USAID made for North Macedonian democracy assistance during this period and interviewed officials from USAID, the Department of State (State), the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and 41 implementing partners in Skopje who received funding. U. S. government agencies obligated more than $45 million in democracy assistance funding for the region from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2017, according to agency award documents and data. This assistance was provided to support strategic objectives, including promoting the rule of law, political processes, citizen engagement, and free media. For example, USAID obligated approximately $38 million, and NED obligated about $4.2 million. Additionally, the Public Affairs Section of the U.N. Mission in Macedonia provided about $3.7 million in grants to nongovernmental organizations to promote democracy through the Democracy Commission Small Grants Program, which cannot exceed $24,000. The Department of the State obligated about another $2 million through its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) to support democracy assistance activities at the regional level, but due to the regional nature of its projects, was unable to provide country-level breakdowns of obligations. For the 13 awards in GAO's sample that GAO reviewed—representing roughly half of USAID's democracy assistance obligations in North Macedonian in FY2012 through FY2017—the agency generally followed operational policies intended to ensure a fair and transparent selection process. These policies require that the agency evaluate applicants against published merit review criteria and document the review procedures it used to assess applicants in selection committee memorandums. For these 13 awards, USAid’S selection committee reviewed applications and made award decisions on the basis of published criteria consistent with those published in public notices for 10 of 13 awards. For three awards originating from the same public notice, however, the selection committee did not assess the strengths and weaknesses of all applicants, and GAO could not determine, based on available documentation, whether it considered all applicants.
Medicaid is a federal-state program that finances health care for low-income individuals and families, including pregnant and postpartum women and children. States have the option to expand eligibility for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which allows states to expand coverage to nearly all individuals with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, regardless of eligibility category. As of October 2019, 33 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid eligibility, and 17 states had not. GAO was asked to review Medicaid coverage of opioid use disorder (OUD) services. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which selected states provide Medicaid coverage for OUD services and (2) how selected states use other funding sources to provide coverage of these services for pregnant women and women in the first 60 days after giving birth, as of January 1, 2019. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed Medicaid programs in six selected states—Alabama, Colorado, Massachusetts, Arkansas, Alabama, South Dakota, Texas, and Massachusetts—and interviewed Medicaid officials from these states and officials from the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). GAO also conducted outreach to Medicaid officials in all 50 states to inquire about whether the state provided coverage for these services as a means of increasing access to these services. The six states GAO selected provide Medicaid and other coverage for a range of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) services for eligible pregnant and Postpartum Women. The selected states' Medicaid manuals indicate these states provide coverage for at least seven of the eight services GAO identified in its review, such as screenings, inpatient and outpatient services, and inpatient residential services. For example, Arkansas and South Dakota—the two states providing only pregnancy-related coverage—covered seven of these eight services. Three of the selected states also covered certain OUD Services for Pregnant Women: screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which is a specific type of screening that involves a health care provider educating individuals with a positive screen for opioid use and referring them to specialized treatment, as needed. In all six states, once Medicaid coverage furnished on the basis of pregnancy ends after 60 days postpartums, women can continue to receive most OUD service under Medicaid if they qualify for Medicaid on another basis. For instance, these women could qualify if their income is equal to or lower than the maximum allowable income for parents, which was generally lower than that of pregnant women. Officials in four of the six states provided estimates of the number of women who maintain Medicaid eligibility after the 60-day period ends. States may also obtain approval from CMS, under a waiver, to extend Medicaid coverage beyond 60 days, but CMS officials were not aware of the amount of states that have done so. In addition to Medicaid coverage, the six selected state Medicaid programs report data on the total number of screenings provided under Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit for children's health care needs. States are required to track and report these data on an annual basis, but not on the substance use disorder screenings. Officials from five states said that it is difficult or impossible to separate and thus track these substance use screenings as distinct from other types of EPSDT screenings or visits that are recorded in Medicaid data. States also conduct outreach and education to providers and parents to ensure awareness of the EPSDT benefits, as required, but GAO found that the extent of information the states provide on these services varied among the states. Officials emphasized that Medicaid's EPSDT benefit requires states to cover any medically necessary treatment or service to address health conditions for a child, including opioid use. Officials also described a variety of initiatives to increase access to substance use Disorder, including OUD, services for children. For for example, officials from Alabama said they recently began a program that offers more substance Use Disorder services in schools in a face-to-face capacity to help increase convenience and reduce stigma around these services, as well as to reduce stigma for both the children and the parents. Officials added that Medicaid pays for covered services that are provided to Medicaid-eligible children in schools under this program. Over 30 states reported that they provided Medicaid coverage to children for services delivered through telehealth in schools, but there was no evidence
BOP is responsible for housing over 149,000 federal inmates in 122 prisons across the United States. According to BOP data, in fiscal year 2019, BOP housed 149,701 inmates and employed 32,525 employees, of which 15,664 were correctional officers with responsibility for the day-to-day supervision of the inmates. BOP has issued pepper spray as a tool to enhance the safety of its employees and inmates. GAO was asked to review issues related to the use of pepper spray in BOP prisons. This report examines (1) the extent to which pepper spray has been used in prisons, (2) BOP's policies and procedures for using pepper spray, and (3) challenges BOP faces in ensuring officer safety and the actions it is taking to address them. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed BOP policies, interviewed BOP headquarters and prison officials, and analyzed BOP incident data from fiscal year 2018. The Department of Justice's (DOJ) Bureau of Prisons (BOP) issued a program statement in September 2018 that states that pepper spray is not to be issued to employees working at minimum security prisons. However, the senior BOP officials GAO interviewed—none of whom said they were involved directly in the policy decision—told GAO they do not believe the explanatory documentation of the decision to not issue pepper spray exists. Officials stated that the decision was likely made for several reasons, including the concern that public perception of using pepper Spray on inmates at minimum-security prisons would not be positive and that canisters would expire before they would be used at these prisons. While the officials' arguments may hold merit, based on GAO's limited analysis GAO found evidence based on its limited analysis that appears to question the underlying decision. To the extent that officials are operating under assumptions that were not fully examined, they are missing a potential opportunity to enhance safety of BOP employees and ensure a safe environment for inmates. For example, while pepper spray was used in 1,680 incidents in 2018, the rate at which staff received minor and moderate injury declined by 60 and 76 percent, respectively, compared to when it was not used, and the inmate injury rate rose slightly, by 2.6 percent, primarily in minor injuries when pepper spraywas used; however, the change in injury rates was not statistically significant. Officials reported that 179 allegations of inappropriate use of force incidents that involved pepper spray were reported from August 2012 through September 2018. Among these cases, the BOP Office for Internal Affairs has investigated and closed 86 cases, and investigators found that 21 involved inappropriate pepper spray use and were adjudicated in various ways. The remaining 93 allegations were still being investigated as of January 2020. Bop-wide costs for pepper spray—specifically the cost to purchase pepper spray canisters and train employees in its use—were approximately $300,000 in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, which was relatively small compared to the overall budget for BOP. Officials told GAO that each BOP prison contracts with its own supplier rather than using a national contract across all BOP, which is based on the premise that each prison is able to secure the best market price for its location and for the volume of canisters needed from the vendor. Officials estimated that a canister costs between $7 and $14 and has a shelf-life of approximately 5 years. As a result, pepper spray does not necessarily need to be purchased on an annual basis, according to a BOP official. Officials at selected prisons reported a number of challenges that affect BOP employee safety, such as understaffing and inmate drug use. Officials identified the following five factors as having the most significant impact on employee safety in prisons: corrections officer under staffing, disruptive inmate behavior due to illegal drugs, inmate use of unauthorized communication devices, inmate gangs, insufficient corrections training, insufficient information-sharing among managers and staff, and inmate unauthorized use of cell phones. Officials said they are taking steps to mitigate some of these challenges.
Navy shipbuilding programs spend billions of dollars annually to develop, design, and construct ships. However, the acquisition phase of a ship's life cycle only accounts for about 30 percent of the ship program's total life-cycle cost. The remaining 70 percent is incurred after the Navy delivers new ships to the fleet during the operational support phase, known as sustainment. GAO was asked to review the Navy's acquisition process for ships. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which Navy ships can be sustained as planned; (2) the costs associated with fixing problems that are the result of not being able to sustain ships as planned, and (3) Navy leadership's effectiveness in holding programs accountable for achieving sustainment outcomes. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Navy acquisition policies and guidance and interviewed officials from Navy shipbuilding program offices, as well as officials from other Navy organizations. The Department of Defense (DOD) and Navy guidance states that the Navy should plan for and design reliability, availability, and maintainability into its ships early in the acquisition process. These factors are intended to help programs ensure that their ships will be sustainable and affordable over their entire life cycle. However GAO found that many Navy programs do not have sustainment plans in place, and those that do do not use them to inform acquisition decisions that could help ensure ships are sustainable at an affordable cost. As a result, the Navy is making acquisitions decisions without the context of a comprehensive sustainment planning document to help identify and mitigate the sustainment effect of its decisions. For example, five of the eleven ship building programs GAO examined did not have a sustainment plan, as required by DOD policy, and the six programs that did have one rarely included a business case analysis that analyzed the relationship between life- cycle costs, reliability requirements, and crew size estimates, and rarely identified and addressed sustainment issues in line with guidance. Navy leadership has not consistently used its acquisition program baselines to hold programs accountable to sustainment goals, and some recent changes will likely not address existing shortfalls. The Navy recently updated its acquisition policy to expand the scope of its Gate process and add a new Gate 7 for sustainment, but this change will not address the need for leadership to more consistently assess sustainment during earlier Gates, when key long-term decisions are being made. Navy acquisition policy states that programs should be overseen and executed from a life cycle perspective—in other words, with attention paid to balancing near-term acquisition outcomes and long- term sustainability. In support of this goal, the policy establishes required sustainment-related briefing content or actions for each Gate. While Gate 7 will function as the dedicated Gate for sustainments, all of the earlier Gates have sustainments-related requirements as well, as shown in the table below. These Gate reviews offer Navy leadership opportunities to conduct oversight of programs' sustainments during early phases of the acquisition processes when key program decisions about requirements, designs, and contracts are made. While the Navy recently established a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Sustainment within the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition's office, it is too soon to assess the role that this official may have in the Acquisition Program Baselines.
In September 2017, Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria struck the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) in the Caribbean, causing catastrophic damage to the territory's critical infrastructure. FEMA's Public Assistance program and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program provide grant funding to state, territorial, local, and tribal governments, as well as certain types of private nonprofit organizations, to assist with the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged public infrastructure. GAO was asked to review FEMA's efforts in the USVI following the 2017 hurricanes. This report examines, among other things, (1) the status of grant funding FEMA obligated for the Public Assistance and HazardMitigation Grant programs as of June 30, 2019, and (2) the extent to which FEMA has developed guidance and procedures for implementing and monitoring these programs. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed FEMA documents and interviewed FEMA and USVI officials. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) obligated more than $1.8 billion in Public Assistance grant funding for 618 projects across the US VI (see fig.). FEMA obligated about $141.2 million for management costs. FEMA obligated $60.6 million for 22 hazard mitigation projects to increase the longer-term resilience of USVI infrastructure during future disasters. While these data represent the current status of funding, the amount of funding will likely increase over time as additional projects are finalized and approved. FEMA, USVI, and contractor personnel identified three areas that affected the implementation of these two recovery programs. Specifically, they cited the limited availability of local USVI staff to implement and oversee recovery programs, the inability of local construction crews to undertake the large number of recovery projects, and the impact of the Territory's difficult fiscal situation on recovery efforts. For example, while the territory hired two contractors to augment its capacity in the shorter term, it established a new Office of Disaster Recovery in February 2019 to oversee recovery in the longer term. The Public Assistance alternative procedures program provides the territory with financial incentives and new flexibilities in implementing recovery projects that are not available through the standard program, such as the ability to use excess funding for long-term mitigation measures to reduce the risk of loss of life and property from future disasters and the authority to restore critical services without regard to pre-disaster condition. However, FEMA officials stated that implementing this program presented challenges that affected recovery efforts and delayed the obligation of funding for permanent work projects in the territory. FEMA has not evaluated its options for providing future emergency sheltering assistance. FEMA authorized the STEP pilot program in October 2017 in response to the widespread damage to homes that displaced USVI residents and overwhelmed sheltering and temporary housing resources. The program funded minimal, temporary protective repairs to private homes to allow residents a safe place to shelter. In August 2018, FEMA expanded the program to include the permanent repair of damaged roofs—the first time in its history that FEMA authorized such work through this pilot program. In May 2019, FEMA's Chief Counsel stated that FEMA had decided to discontinue the pilot program due to significant challenges and lessons learned from prior experiences implementing the program. While FEMA officials told GAO they plan to use other sheltering programs when the next disaster strikes, these programs may not be sufficient in addressing the emergency shelter needs of disaster survivors, especially in communities where implementing such programs is not feasible. FEMA officials also stated that given the agency's decision to discontinuing the program, conducting a broad evaluation of FEMA's sheltering options would be useful to ensure that FEMA is prepared to respond effectively to future disaster needs. The USVI and FEMA have structures in place for overseeing recovery activities. As the recipient of federal disaster funding through these two programs—Public Assistance and the Hazard Mitigated Grant Program—the USVI is responsible for providing oversight over the programs to ensure they are implemented in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and FEMA policies and guidance. The territory developed administrative plans for the programs and designated two territorial entities to manage the administration of recovery programs—the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management agency and the governor's authorized representative. These entities are responsible for ensuring that the programs are implemented and that subrecipients are complying with all program requirements. In February 2019, the territory established the Office of disaster recovery to oversee the implementation and oversight of the programs, including tracking and reporting on the progress of individual projects and overseeing the submission of reimbursement requests for completed work. The office is also responsible for monitoring and publicly reporting the progress and status of federal recovery funding at http://www.usviod
Climate change poses risks to many U.S. environmental and economic systems, according to the United States Global Change Research Program's (USGCRP) Fourth National Climate Assessment. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to enhance resilience to climate change. This report examines (1) the extent to which the federal government has a strategic approach for investing in climate resilience projects, (2) key steps that provide an opportunity to strategically prioritize such projects for federal investment, and (3) strengths and limitations of options for focusing federal funding on high-priority projects. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed past GAO work, reports, and other sources, and interviewed federal officials, researchers, and stakeholders with relevant expertise. The federal government does not have an intentional, cross-cutting approach to strategically identify and prioritize projects for the purpose of enhancing climate resilience—that is, an approach that looks holistically at federal investments to ensure they address the nation's most significant climate risks and provide the highest net benefits relative to other potential projects. In addition, federal agencies may take actions to invest in projects with potential climate resilience benefits related to their own mission areas using funds from federal programs designed for other purposes. However, no federal entity, government-wide coordinating body, or other organizational arrangement has been established to identify and prioritize projects for investment in an iterative fashion. Several stakeholders told GAO that a strategic and iterative risk-informed approach would allow for a more purposeful, coordinated, and comprehensive federal response to climate risks. Such an approach could supplement the agency-specific approaches to climate resilience investment currently carried out by individual agencies with different statutes, goals, constituencies, and funding streams. Six key steps—defined strategic goals, assessing high-risk areas for targeted resilience investment, identifying potential project ideas, prioritizing projects, implementing high- priority projects, and monitoring projects and climate risks—provide an opportunity for the government to strategically identifying and prioritizing climate resilient projects. For example, the Louisiana coastal master planning effort and the Canadian Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund—two examples of domestic and international efforts that provide examples of approaches for prioritizing resilience projects—both seek to identify projects that help enhance community resilience to several emerging risks, including risks associated with climate change, such as flooding and sea level rise. The steps to define the strategic goals of a federal climate resilience effort include defining the effort's strategic goals and how the effort will be carried out, designating an entity and providing authority for it to lead the effort, identifying participants and defining responsibilities, and determining how it will be funded, among other steps. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the federal agency responsible for leading the Mitigation Framework Leadership Group, an interagency group that developed the National Mitigation Investment Strategy—a national strategy for mitigating natural hazards and increasing the nation’s resilience to natural hazards. FEMA officials told us that the strategy sets goals and recommendations that set the stage for developing approaches to address changing conditions that impact disaster resilience, but the strategy does not explicitly address future climate change risks or include a strategic investment approach for climate resilience. FEMA and other federal agencies have provided ad hoc funding for projects that may convey some benefits, but GAO's past work has shown an absence of governmentwide strategic planning for climate change and the government has not implemented key GAO recommendations to improve strategic planning. Federal agencies have made efforts to manage climate change risk within existing programs and operations—a concept known as mainstreaming—and these efforts may convey climate resilient benefits. For instance, an agency planning to build a seawall to protect a coastal facility might build it higher to account for rising sea level projections. Alternatively, the military may consider climate change as part of existing construction plans on coastal installations by, for example, raising a building to include a “sacrificial” first floor and protecting critical assets—such as computer servers—from potential flooding by locating them on the building's higher floors. Additional, strategic federal investments in large-scale projects--such as those discussed in our report—may also be needed to manage some of the nations largest climate risks, since climate change cuts across agency missions and poses fiscal exposures larger than any one agency can manage. GAE identified two options to focus federal funding—coordinating funding provided through multiple existing federal programs with various purposes and creating a new funding source specifically for high- Priority Climate Resilience Projectsand these options have both strengths and
The F-35 Lightning II is DOD's most expensive and ambitious aircraft program, with a planned acquisition cost of more than $400 billion to develop and field more than 3,300 aircraft over the next 35 years. The program is critical to DOD's ability to maintain the readiness of its expanding fleet of aircraft. GAO was asked to review DOD's management of the program. This report addresses the extent to which (1) F- 35 performance is meeting warfighter requirements and any challenges with spare parts availability, (2) the supply chain is positioned to meet future requirements, (3) DOD can effectively manage and move parts to support aircraft around the world, and (4) DOD is fully accounting for spare parts within its supply chain and their associated costs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed program documents, interviewed DOD and contractor officials, and analyzed aircraft performance and spare parts data from May through November 2018. The Department of Defense (DOD) is not meeting its warfighter performance requirements for the F-135 Stratotanker and Joint Strike Fighter because spare parts are not available to keep aircraft flying enough of the time necessary to meet mission requirements. Specifically, from May to November 2018, fleet-wide aircraft performance did not meet any of the U.S. warfighter's requirements. Spare parts shortages have contributed to lower-than-required aircraft performance. For example, according to prime contractor data, aircraft across the fleet were unable to fly 29.7 percent of the total time in November 2018 due to spare parts shortages. DOD is taking a number of actions to try to increase the availability of spare parts, such as increasing the capacity of suppliers to produce spare parts to meet sustainment requirements, improving the timing of parts deliveries, and addressing the reliability of certain parts that are failing more frequently than expected. However, DOD is likely to continue to face challenges in meeting warfighters' requirements due to its current approach to planning for and allocating spare parts. DOD's approach does not take into account the time required to repair aircraft and does not account for the need to reduce aircraft sustainment costs. Without a comprehensive review to determine what additional actions are needed to close the gap between warfighter needs for aircraft performance, taking into account also the need for cost reductions, DOD risks that its fleet may fall short of the capability needed to support its critical national defense missions in the future. DOD faces challenges in managing and moving parts to a deploying and expanding global fleet. DOD has provided spare parts for the few F-45 deployments that have occurred to date, but these events have also highlighted several key risks that could hinder future F-5 fleet readiness. These risks are related to the make-up of the afloat and deployment spares packages, the prioritization process for distributing scarce parts among global F-15 participants, and the program's global networks for moving parts. For instance, while the program has established a target date of September 1, 2021 for full operational capability of the global network, the program does not yet have a detailed plan with clear requirements and milestones or an integrated schedule to move the network from initial operational capability to fully operational capability. Furthermore, the schedule, planning, and risks associated with this delayed global network are not addressed in DOD's recently updated F-25 Life Cycle Sustainment Plan. Without completing a detailed plans for the establishment of a global network that outlines clear requirements, milestones, and includes mechanisms to identify and mitigate risks, DOD cannot ensure that its global supply chain will support U. S. and international program participants as intended. In addition, DOD does not have records indicating how many spare parts it has purchased, where they are located, and how much the military services have spent on them. DOD guidance for program managers states that a sound program strategy requires understanding and clarity of desired outcomes and the plans and resources necessary to achieve those outcomes. Until DOD establishes a policy that clearly defines how it will maintain accountability for F-55 spare parts and lays out the steps that it will take to implement that policy, DOD will continue to lack critical visibility of F-five assets, which is necessary to hold the prime contractor accountable for providing sufficient readiness at a reasonable cost. Additionally, absent a DOD Comptroller-approved methodology for the services to record on their financial statements the funds spent on their spares, DOD may not have a full picture of F35 costs, which could impede its ability to effectively negotiate with the contractor for sustainment support and improve readiness of the expanding
The Cannon Building, completed in 1908, is the oldest congressional office building and houses 142 office suites, five conference rooms, four hearing rooms, and the Caucus Room, which can accommodate large meetings. It also includes a library, food servery, and a health unit. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is in the process of renovating the building and expects to complete the project by the start of the 116th Congress in 2020. AOC expects to spend approximately $753 million to renovate the building. This testimony discusses (1) the status of the Cannon project, (2) AOC's cost estimates for the project, and (3) the extent to which AOC has implemented GAO's leading practices for developing high-quality, reliable cost estimates and schedules. This statement is based on prior GAO reports and testimonies issued from January 2009 through June 2018. For those reports, GAO reviewed AOC documents and interviewed AOC officials. GAO also reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance and interviewed a non-generalizable sample of AOC staff to obtain their views on the project's cost and schedule. The Cannon project is currently in its second phase of construction and is expected to be completed in November 2020. As part of its planning and design work through 2014, AOC identified the scope of the project as correcting most of the identified deficiencies and addressing current requirements such as for energy conservation, physical security, hazardous materials abatement, and historic preservation. The project, among other things, includes: substantial reconfiguration of member suites and the reconstruction of the building's top floor to convert storage space into new suites, preservation of the stone exterior, replacement of all plumbing, heating and cooling, fire protection, electrical, and alarm systems, and refurbishment of restrooms to make them more accessible to people with disabilities. In January 2014, the AOC estimated that the project would cost $753.5 million and that it would take 5 years to complete. However, the project is experiencing cost pressures from the greater-than-anticipated risks and ineffective mitigations stemming from unforeseen conditions, design issues, and scope changes. In June 2019, A OC reported that it expects that the cost to finish the project will increase by 10 to 15 percent over its initial estimate, resulting in a final cost between approximately $828 million and $866 million. In August 2019, a key cost-schedule risk analysis AOC conducted in January 2018 concluded that there was a high probability (over 90 percent) that actual costs would be equal to or less than the $753-million estimate. A OC is currently progressing, as planned, in the second of the four building sections to be renovated (Phase 2). AOC is awaiting the contractor's proposal on the costs to address the requirements outlined in four “design bulletins” issued by AOC that, in part, describe changes to the project’s scope based on lessons learned in Phase 1. The design bulletins describe contract modifications that AOC estimates will increase the cost of Phase 2, as well as future phases (Phases 3, 4, and 5). GAO has previously reported on AOCs cost estimating policies and guidance, and has made recommendations to AOC to improve its cost-estimating process, such as by incorporating leading practices GAO identified as lacking for cost estimating into its cost estimating guidance and policies. In addition, in August 2019 AOC began updating its integrated cost-Schedule Risk Analysis, with the aim of more accurately determining the degree to which costs are increasing and its estimated cost at completion.
Since 2009, federal banking regulators have strengthened their approach to oversight of management at large depository institutions. GAO was asked to review regulators' oversight of large institutions. This report examines (1) the extent to which regulators' supervision policies and procedures were consistent with leading risk-management practices, (2) how examiners applied agency policies and practices for supervision of management, and (3) trends in regulators' supervisory concern data since 2012 and how regulators tracked and used such data. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed examination documents from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and selected a non-generalizable sample of nine depository institution from each of the regulators for review. The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC are the nation's three largest banking regulators. These regulators supervise about one-third of the 1.2 million depository entities in the U.S. financial system and oversee about $2.3 trillion in assets. The Depository Institutions Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs asked GAO to review the regulators' approaches to supervision of large and mid-size institutions. To do so, GA O reviewed examination documentation from the regulators and interviewed staff at each regulator. Since 2009, the regulators have made progress in addressing management weaknesses and taking timely action on supervisory concerns at large institutions, such as matters requiring attention (MRA) and matters requiring immediate attention (MRIA). For example, in 2012, the Federal Reserve and FDIC updated their policies to provide better definitions of certain risk categories and enable examiners to consider individual risks within the context of all risks facing the institution. In addition, in 2014, the OCC revised its MRA guidance to require that examiners identify and communicate in writing to institutions the concern, cause, consequences of inaction, required corrective action, and management's commitment for corrective action. In 2016, OCC published heightened standards requirements for institutions with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, and in 2017, the board of directors of FDIC issued a statement setting forth basic principles to guide the identification and communication of supervisory recommendations to the boards of directors. The regulators' revised policies for oversight of risk management and supervisory issues generally were consistent in that they addressed leading risk management practices. For instance, the FDIC and Federal Reserve generally provided examiners with clear, actionable objectives for risk management governance and required review of institutions' compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, in some cases, the guidance did not provide clear and complete information to help examiners assess the potential impact of risk on the institution's safety and soundness. In contrast, the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) guidance does not provide specific, measurable guidelines for assessing risks that might necessitate an enforcement action. Federal internal control standards provide that management conducts risk assessment to develop appropriate risk responses. Key attributes of effective risk assessment are definitions of objectives and risk tolerances and management defines risks in specific and measurable terms so they are clearly stated and can be measured. In assessing risks, examiners generally follow agency risk- management guidance, but OCC has relatively limited written procedures for escalation of concerns to enforcement actions. Federal Reserve staff told GAO that in practice the facts and circumstances of the case dictate when escalation is appropriate, but Federal Reserve has not defined specific guidelines for when a concern would require escalation to a more formal regulatory action (such as enforcement action). Federal banking regulators collect and analyze supervisory data but do so to different degrees. FDIC collects data on MRA and MRIA data in a manner that challenges management's ability to fully monitor its supervision activities. The data GAO examined indicate that management weaknesses have been a consistent concern since 2012. In general, the amount of time MRA concerns remain open generally has been reduced, but GAO found data gaps in FDIC's recording of MRBA data that resulted in incomplete information for FDIC management.
In 2006, the Army established the Army Facilities Standardization Program (AFSP) to standardize and streamline the process for developing, maintaining, and disseminating construction criteria. The Army established nine Centers of Standardization to support the AFSP. The Centers are responsible for developing and managing Army standard design packages for specific facility types and their designs. GAO was asked to review the Army's oversight of the Centers. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Army has performance measures to track the Centers' progress in achieving key objectives and (2) whether the Centers have engaged in activities that support the key objectives found in their charter and are consistent with key principles and concepts in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance for a disciplined capital programming process. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Army, the Centers, OMB, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The Army has limited performance measures for tracking progress toward its Centers' key objectives of developing and refining Centers' policies and processes, consistently applying Army standard designs, and supporting AFSP objectives and priorities. For example, while the Army tracks program execution related to the Centers efforts to develop new and update existing standard designs (the programs first objective), it does not have performance measures in place to assess progress toward the other two objectivesassuring consistent application of standards and monitoring execution to meet the overarching AFSP and standardization processwhich include, among other things, reducing design costs and time, construction costs, and change orders during construction. In addition, while Army and Centers officials told GAO that the use of standard designs reduces project costs, time, and changes orders, they could not provide supporting data because neither the Army nor the Centers has developed and implemented performance measures. Developing and implementing performance measures would enable the Army to demonstrate that the Centers are supporting DOD's annual performance goals, which include reducing cost overruns and schedule delays by up to 50 percent for military construction projects. The use of the standard design does not introduce increased liability for the Centers if issues arise during a construction project. According to Centers officials, the design for a facility project is typically developed by one of the USACE district offices or an architect-engineer contractor. Further, according to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the contractor is responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the contractor under its contract. The FAR also stipulates that the contractor may be liable for government costs resulting from errors or deficiencies in designs furnished under the contract. However, Centers officials stated that there have been no instances in which the Centers was a party to legal action related to using a standard design. As a result, they would not have increased liability in the event that changes were required during construction of a specific project.
DHS plays a critical role in protecting the nation against threats and securing our nation's critical infrastructure and critical infrastructures from cyber-based intrusions and attacks. GAO has designated DHS's management of high-risk areas as high risk since 2003, and since 2005 has issued a series of recommendations aimed at improving DHS's performance in these areas. This testimony discusses DHS's progress in (1) strengthening management functions, (2) addressing priority recommendations, and (3) demonstrating demonstrated, sustained progress. This statement is based on GAO products issued from September 2012 through March 2019, along with selected updates conducted in March 2019 on the status of recommendations GAO made in April 2019. To conduct these updates, GAO reviewed DHS documents and interviewed DHS officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made important progress in strengthening its management functions but considerable work remains. With top leadership support and commitment, DHS has met three out of five criteria for removal from GAO's High Risk List—leadership commitment, action planning, and monitoring progress. DHS's top leadership, including leaders at the Secretary and Deputy Secretary level, has demonstrated exemplary commitment and support for addressing the department's management challenges. DHS has also taken actions to institutionalize this commitment to help ensure the long-term success of its efforts. For example, the Under Secretary for Management's Integrated Priorities initiative is designed to strengthen the integration of DHS's business operations across the department. In addition, during monthly leadership meetings with the Secretary, the Chief Executive Officers have been providing status updates on their respective actions to address the high risk designation. Furthermore, top DHS leaders routinely meet with GAO management to discuss progress on high- risk areas. For the criteria for demonstrated, sustainable progress, DHS fully addressed 17 out of the 30 outcomes that are the basis for gauging its progress across management areas. To fully meet the criteria, DHS needs to continue implementing its Integrated Strategy for High-Risk Management and maintain engagement with us to show measurable and sustainable progress in implementing corrective actions and achieving outcomes. DHS also needs to make additional progress in identifying and allocating resources in certain areas—namely, acquisition, information technology, and financial management—to fully demonstrate its capacity. In April 2019, we sent a letter to the Acting Secretary of DHS detailing 26 open recommendations that we deem highest priority for implementation. These 26 recommendations fall into six major areas—emergency preparedness and response, border security, transportation security, infrastructure and management, cybersecurity, and chemical and nuclear security. Many of these recommendations cut across DHS's mission areas that are critical for national security. Fourteen of the 26 priority open recommendations we identified in the April 2019 letter are directed to acting officials serving in vacant positions. We have also issued two recommendations to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) which is currently operating under acting leadership.
The federal government spends nearly $6 billion annually on leasing space from private entities, and GSA has taken steps to encourage private sector competition for government leases. GAO was asked to review GSA's leasing process. This report examines (1) lease requirements selected stakeholders identified as affecting cost and competition and steps GSA took to address their concerns and (2) how GSA identified stakeholder concerns and evaluated its simplified lease model. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and executive orders; analyzed GSA lease data for fiscal years 2016-2018; and interviewed GSA officials and a non-generalizable sample of 20 GSA lessors and real estate brokers selected based on their experience with GSA leases. The General Services Administration (GSA) is the federal government's primary civilian real property agent and leases space for federal agencies in privately owned buildings when it does not have available federally owned space that can meet the needs of federal agency tenants. GSA uses different processes to carry out the leasing process depending on the size, cost, and type of the lease. For all of these processes, the leasing-planning process begins when GSA receives a request for space from a tenant agency and determines that fulfilling the request will require leasing space. According to the typical process outlined in the GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) PBS Desk Leasing Guide, officials work with the tenant agency to define the requirements for the leased space, including the geographic area in which GSA will search for available properties. After this initial stage, GSA takes additional steps to acquire a new lease. However, for certain office space leases larger than 500 square feet, which represent more than 90 percent of GSA’s leases as of the end of fiscal year 2019, the agency can deviate from its typical leasing process and instead use what it calls the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP). In this program, instead of proposing requirements to potential lessors, the lessors first submit offers to GSA for pre-existing available space. Once GSA evaluates these standing offers to eliminate those that would not meet the space requirements, it ranks the bids by present value, and selects the lowest cost option. For high value leases with a net annual rent above the statutory "prospectus" threshold—adjusted by GSA to $3.1 million in fiscal year2019—GSA is required to take further steps for lessors to reduce their bids. The lessors GAO spoke with identified a number of factors that can affect the cost and the number of lessors willing to bid on a GSA leased space. For example, about three-fourths of these lessors told GAO that the volume and complexity of requirements in the leases can make these leases less attractive to potential bidders and can result in fewer lessors competing for a lease. In addition, about one-third of the more experienced lessors said that GSA requires more frequent or comprehensive janitorial and maintenance services than do private sector leases, which can increase the cost of these leases. Stakeholders also identified several specific GSA requirements that they said can affect costs and competition, such as the ability to substitute tenant agencies for another tenant agency in a leased space and the requirement for real estate tax reimbursement. In response to these and other factors, some lessors reported that they may increase their bid prices to ensure that they will cover their costs, while others said that they would not bid on another lease unless there were additional cost increases built into the lease to cover these costs. In 2011, in response to lessors’ concerns, in 2011 GSA began a process to reform its leasing process, including developing a simplified model for leasing smaller value leases. This model is intended to make GSA more efficient and cost-effective by reducing the amount of time it takes to complete a lease and reducing lease holdovers and short-term extensions, among other things. While GAO analyzed the leases GSA entered into during fiscal year 2016 through 2018 that were potentially eligible for the simplified model, it found that the model was used on only 124 of the 406 leases, or about 31 percent of the leases that were eligible for this model. While GSA continues to conduct industry outreach, its more recent outreach efforts have not gathered information from a representative group of lessor groups, and it has not analyzed the information it does collect and therefore does not know if its reform efforts are adequately addressing stakeholders’
NASA's SLS, Orion, and EGS programs are intended to transport humans beyond low-Earth orbit, but the agency has been unable to achieve agreed-to cost and schedule performance. In November 2018, NASA announced that the first SLS flight would be delayed by 6 to 12 months and the first Orion flight by up to 19 months. GAO was asked to review the SLS and Orion programs. This report assesses (1) the performance of the human space exploration programs relative to their commitments, including any technical challenges; (2) the extent to which NASA's use of contract award fees is achieving desired outcomes; and (3) program-level lessons learned regarding the acquisition of the EGS Mobile Launcher against acquisition best practices. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed NASA's cost, schedule, and performance data and interviewed NASA officials. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Space Launch System (SLS), Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) programs have experienced significant cost growth and schedule delays in recent years. SLS: SLS program costs increased by 14.7 percent as of fourth quarter fiscal year 2018, but GAO's analysis shows that number increases to 29.0 percent when accounting for costs that NASA shifted to future missions. Orion: Orion program cost growth increased by 5.6 percent in 2018. However, this cost growth is associated with a launch date 7 months earlier than its agency baseline commitment launch date. If the Orion program executes to the launch date established in its baseline commitment, costs will increase further. EGS: EGS program costs have increased by 23 percent over the baseline. NASA's award fee plans provide for hundreds of millions of dollars to incentivize contractor performance but the programs continue to fall behind schedule and incur cost overruns. For example, NASA's incentive fee plans for the Orion crew spacecraft contracts include multiple incentives aimed at incentivizing different aspects of contractor performance, such as meeting milestones or meeting cost targets. GA O's past work shows that when incentive contracts are properly structured, the contractor has a profit motive to keep costs low, deliver a product on time, and make decisions that help ensure the quality of the product. Prior GAO work also shows, however, that incentives are not always effective tools for achieving desired acquisition outcomes. In some cases, there are significant disconnects between contractor performance for which the contractor was awarded the majority of award fees possible without achieving desired program results. Additionally, some agencies did not have methods to evaluate the effectiveness of award fee incentives. The Federal Acquisition Regulation and NASA contracting guidance indicate that award fee is appropriate when the work to be performed is such that it is neither feasible nor effective to devise predetermined objective incentive targets applicable to cost and technical performance. The Orion program is not on schedule to meet the June 2020 launch date for the first mission due to delays with the European Service Module (ESM) and ongoing component issues with the avionics systems for the crew module, including issues discovered during testing. In addition, the program has been underreporting its development cost growth since the December 2017 replan because of a decision to shift some costs to future flights while not adjusting the baseline downward to reflect this shift. By not adjusting its baseline to account for the reduced scope, NASA will continue to report costs against an inflated baseline, hence underreporting the extent of cost growth. In May 2014, we recommended that NASA establish a baseline for each SLS increment, as well as for any evolved Orion or ground systems capability. NASA partially concurred, but has not taken any action to date.
In 2017, nearly one in three Medicare Part D beneficiaries received an opioid prescription, and Medicare spending for prescription opioids was almost $3.4 billion. Medicare data for 2017 showed that the beneficiaries potentially at risk for opioid misuse and abuse were more likely to be under 65 years of age, female, and dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. For years, to limit Medicaid at-risk beneficiaries' access to controlled substances, state Medicaid programs have used lock-in programs, which restrict certain beneficiaries’ access to a single prescriber (such as a physician or other health-care provider), a single pharmacy, or both. States have broad discretion in how and whether to implement lock-ins, including how to identify at- risk beneficiaries. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers Medicare, established a framework for plan sponsors that volunteer to establish Medicare drug management programs (DMPs) to identify beneficiaries at risk of opioid misuse or abuse and attempt to mitigate risk by increasing communication and coordination across plan sponsors, health- care prescribers, pharmacists, and beneficiaries. GAO was asked to review the implementation of DMPs in Medicare. This report examines (1) the steps CMS and plan sponsors have taken to identify and mitigate the risk of drug abuse among Medicare beneficiaries and (2) factors stakeholders believe could contribute to the success of Drug Management Programs. To do this work, GAO reviewed CMS documents, interviewed CMS officials, and interviewed five plan sponsors and six stakeholder organizations representing physicians, pharmacy benefit managers, and patients. HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. CMS and its plan sponsors use case management to identify potentially at- Risk Beneficiaries at Risk of Opioid Misuse and Attempt to Mitigate That Risk. Case management involves coordinating the provision of care, referred to as case management, to determine if a beneficiary is being appropriately treated with frequently abused drugs. CMS’s framework includes two steps for identifying potentially atrisk beneficiaries. First, CMS identifies potentially at Risk beneficiaries based on key clinical factors, such as whether they are receiving hospice, palliative, or end-of-life care or have active cancer-related pain. Second, plan sponsors’ clinicians must begin case management for each potentially At-Risk beneficiary with the beneficiary's prescriber of frequently abused drug, with the purpose of determining if current treatment is appropriate, examining specifically if the beneficiary is appropriately treating the beneficiary with frequently abuse-prone drugs. The framework also includes reporting requirements on plan sponsors who choose to establish a DMP. For each beneficiary deemed to be at risk, the coverage limitation tools that will be used to limit the beneficiary‘s access to frequently abused prescription drugs must also be reported to CMS, through the Overutilization Monitoring System. The system was originally designed and implemented by CMS in July 2013 to oversee plan sponsors' compliance with CMS's opioid overutilization policy and is based on beneficiary claims data. It was enhanced in 2019 to support DMP implementation. The Overutilized Monitoring System creates and sends a list of beneficiaries meeting minimum criteria quarterly to plan sponsors with D MPs. CMS continues to monitor the beneficiary quarterly through the system and can re-identify the beneficiary if he or she meets the minimum criteria. CMS is also updating its Medicare Part C and D audit protocol so it can audit DMP related beneficiary notices. Finally, CMS tracks the utilization of opioids by Part D enrollees using Part D data and the Over utilization Monitoring System and reported that between 2012 and 2017, there was a 33 percent decrease in the number of enrollees meeting or exceeding 90 milligrams of opioids per day for at least one day. Officials from CMS and stakeholders GAO interviewed stated that coordination, communication, and flexibility to manage and incorporate best practices are key factors to DMP success. For example, several officials with plan sponsors said that sponsors should communicate with, and educate stakeholders to ensure that DMP, especially their coverage limitations tools, are not viewed as punitive tools by beneficiaries, but rather as tools for keeping them safe. Stakeholders also stated that through education and other means, sponsors should also encourage health care providers and their enrollees to view opioid addiction by at risk beneficiaries as a disease rather than a choice. For some stakeholders, effective collaboration among prescribes and patients in making individualized treatment decisions for pain
The Air Force has identified ABMS as its solution to support broad Department of Defense (DOD) efforts to develop Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) capabilities. These capabilities will eventually allow U.S. forces from all of the military services, as well as allies, to conduct military operations across all warfighting domains. ABMS is intended to replace and modernize the capabilities of the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), which provides the warfighter with the capability to detect, identify, and track airborne threats, among other capabilities. In July 2018, the DOD Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved an ABMS Initial Capabilities Document that describes which capabilities would need to be developed and which associated gaps in current capabilities the Air Force will need to address. The House Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to review the status of ABMS. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has defined ABMS requirements and plans to develop a business case for ABMS and (2) whether the Air force has established the management structure and decision-making authorities necessary to plan and execute ABMS efforts. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed DOD and Air Force officials. The Air Force started planning for the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) in 2017, but has not yet established a plan or business case that identifies its requirements, a plan to attain mature technologies when needed, a cost estimate, and an affordability analysis. As a result of recent ABMS management and scope changes, the air force remains early in the planning process and has not determined how to meet the capabilities or identify systems that will comprise ABMS, which will be managed as a family of systems and not as a traditional acquisition program typically governed by DOD Instruction 5000.02, nor as a middle tier acquisition. In January 2020, theAir Force provided GAO with a draft version of high-level descriptions of the 28 development areas that will eventually compose the architecture and technologies that make up ABMS; however, the document did not fully define the requirements or capabilities for the development areas nor identify which organizations would lead each effort. For example, the cloudONE description does not indicate specific technical requirements that must be met, such as amount of storage, the number of users, or data transmission rate. In December 2019, Air Force and DOD officials stated that an overall plan did not exist and would be difficult to develop in the near term due to the unclear scope of requirements. Without a plan and business case, it will be difficult for the Air Air Force to ensure that the needed technologies will be mature when needed and that the required capabilities will be developed within required time frames. The air force has taken some steps to establish a management structure for the ABMS effort, but the authorities of Air Force offices involved in ABMS are unclear. Internal controls, which provides standards for effective management of programs, state that management should establish the organizational structure and authority necessary to enable the entity to plan, execute, control, and assess the organization in achieving its objectives. The absence of fully defined and documented decisionmaking authorities, which are communicated to all those involved, increases the risk to the airforce's ability to successfully plan and assess ABMS development efforts.
The PSLF program and the temporary expanded process provide eligible borrowers with forgiveness on the remaining balance of their Direct Loans after they have met all program requirements. To receive forgiveness for a loan, borrowers are required to be employed in a qualifying public service job for 10 years when making 120 qualifying payments. Borrowers must also be employed at a public service organization, a government organization, agency, or entity at any level (federal, state, local, or Tribal); a nonprofit, tax exempt organization (under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code); or another private nonprofit organization that provides certain public services. The Department of Education (Education) administers the Direct Loan program through the Office of Federal Student Aid. The temporary expanded program allows borrowers to qualify for loan forgiveness if they are participating in several additional types of repayment plans, including the Graduated repayment plan and Extended repayment plan. GAO was asked to review Education's implementation of the PSLLF and temporary expanded processes. This testimony is based on GAO reports issued in 2018 and 2019 on (1) the extent to which Education has processed loan forgiveness applications for borrowers and (2) how shortcomings in the information Education provides to thePSLF servicer have resulted in uncertainty about program requirements and increased the risk of potential errors in borrower eligibility determinations. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency documents and interviewed officials from Education, the loan servicer, and selected organizations representing student borrowers. Despite broad borrower interest in the Direct Loans program, approximately 99 percent of borrowers have been denied loan forgiveness through both the Public Service Loan Fund (PSF) Program and the Temporary Expanded Process, according to GAO's most recent publically released data through March 2019. For borrowers that have been approved, Education has forgiven almost $31 million in outstanding student loans, an average of more than $59,000 per approved borrower. For the 1 percent of applications that were approved from May 2018 through May 2019, Education had granted almost $27 million in loan forgiveness, totaling about 4 percent of the $700 million appropriated funds. The high denial rates suggest that many borrowers are confused by the requirements of the program and process. For example, borrowers have complained of spending years making payments, believing they were making progress towards loan forgiveness and then learning that they were not eligible for forgiveness because they had not submitted an application for the program. In addition, borrowers who were denied may not be aware that they might be eligible for loan forgiven through the temporary expansion process, potentially missing out on this temporary opportunity. To address these issues, Education agreed with GAO recommendations to improve service to borrowers by expanding outreach, streamlining processes, and providing information to help borrowers catch and resolve errors. Education has not yet taken sufficient actions to fully implement these recommendations. For instance, Education does not have a comprehensive document or manual to provide the servicer with guidance and instructions on how to operate the program, which makes it difficult to effectively administer the loan forgiveness program and provide consistent services to borrowers. GA O has previously reported on how unclear processes and a lack of information about the program could contribute to borrower confusion and high loan denial rates. In its 2019 report, which is being released today, GA O found that Education has taken some actions to address some of the recommendations made in its 2018 report, such as providing borrowers with more detailed qualifying payment information, but has not fully implemented others. For examples, Education did not provide borrowers with sufficient information on the eligibility of qualifying employers and did not ensure that the agency's other loan servicers provided consistent information on borrowers' prior loan payments, which could increase the risk that qualifying payments were miscounted for the PSF program. Education also does not provide information to borrowers about options they have to contest their temporary expansion determinations or other aspects of the eligibility determination process.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is one of the nation's largest and most complex agencies, with more than 200,000 employees and an annual budget of more than $400 billion. Over the past two decades, GAO and others have expressed concern about certain human capital practices at VA and its components, including a lack of leadership attention to strategic human capital management. In November 2018, VA's Office of Inspector General identified leadership and workforce investment as a major management challenge. GAO was asked to testify on VA's staffing challenges. This testimony is based on GAO's March 2019 high-risk area update, which focuses on the extent to which (1) staffing challenges at VA are systemic, long-standing, and undermine VA's mission; (2) strategic human resources management is at risk government-wide and is impacting agencies' missions; and (3) VA's succession planning policies and procedures are consistent with key leading practices. To prepare this testimony, we relied on our previously published work in this area, as well as our preliminary observations from our ongoing review of VA's HR operations. The federal government continues to face a number of challenges in strategically managing its workforce. For example, in March 2019, we reported that VA's 172 medical centers have large staffing shortages, including physicians, registered nurses, physician assistants, psychologists, and physical therapists, and HR specialists and assistants. In July 2016, we found that losses in VHA's five clinical occupations with the largest staffing shortages increased from about 5,900 employees in fiscal year 2011 to about 7,700 in 2015. Voluntary resignations and retirements were the primary drivers. In addition, in December 2016 GAO found that several problems combined to impede the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) ability to improve delivery of health care services to veterans. These problems include high attrition (often involving transfers to other federal agencies), increased workload, and burnout among VA's human capital staff. A number of the staffing challenges facing VA are actually part of a broader set of human capital issues affecting government as a whole. As GAO noted in its March 2019 update of government high- risk areas, the federal government faces long-term challenges in strategic human resource management. These include workforce planning, recruitment, on-boarding, compensation, engagement, succession planning, and retirement programs. Further, adding to agencies' staffing challenges is the fact that much has changed since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the Classification Act of 1949 laid the foundation of much of today's federal personnel system. Agencies' missions have evolved and employees' expectations of work and the workplace are changing. As a result, agencies need to identify and assess existing skills, competencies, and skills gaps, acquire and assign talent, and ensure they have the capacity to meet current and future mission requirements. In our March 2019 report, we identified key trends in agency operations and attitudes toward work that are affecting how federal work is done and, consequently, consequently the skills and competencies that workers will need to accomplish agency missions. To help agencies effectively carry out their missions, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and federal agencies must take some important steps to address ongoing human capital problems. These actions include continuing to develop the capacity of agencies to measure and address existing mission-critical skills gaps and using workforce analytics to predict and mitigate future gaps.
The F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, is DOD's most costly and ambitious aircraft acquisition, with a total estimated acquisition cost of over $400 billion. The program is in the midst of a multiyear, multibillion-dollar effort to develop and field three aircraft variants for the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and eight other countries. In 2019, the program expects to complete development of the Block 4 modernization effort, which will add over $13.9 billion to the program's total acquisition costs. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for GAO to review the F- 35 annually until the program reaches full-rate production. This is the fifth report under that provision. GAO's objectives were to (1) provide information on the programs progress toward completing operational testing and resolving deficiencies found in testing; (2) assess the program’s production performance and manufacturing efficiency initiatives; and (3) assess progress with Block 4 development efforts. To do so, GAO reviewed program documents and met with DOD and contractor officials. The F-15C Lightning II Lightning II Joint Strike fighter program continues to make progress in meeting its schedule and cost estimates, but the Department of Defense (DOD) could face additional cost growth if it does not address some of the challenges GAO identified in its prior work, including the following: Operational testing: The program conducted a majority of its planned operational testing in 2019, but added 9 months to the schedule to complete the tests. As of February 2020, according to test officials, it had completed 156 flight tests; however, it must still conduct four open-air flight tests, the remaining cybersecurity tests of the air vehicle and mission systems, and 64 simulated flight tests. The 9-month delay provides additional time for the program to address a June 2018 GAO recommendation that it resolve critical deficiencies before making its full- rate production decision, currently planned to occur between September 2020 and March 2021. Deficiencies found in operational testing: While the program resolved nearly 300 of the deficiencies it had identified in developmental and operational testing during 2019, it discovered even more over the same period. Specifically, 331 new deficiencies were identified during operational testing. As a result, as of December 2019 the program had 870 open deficiencies, of which 9 have operational workarounds, 861 remain open, and the program plans to continue to address the remaining 2,300 deficiencies. Manufacturing and supply chain risks: The airframe contractor has continued to change and refine production processes, aiming to improve efficiency amidst concurrent development and production. According to GAO analysis, the total number of key manufacturing processes identified in the final assembly phase increased 70 percent, to a total of over 10,000 critical processes. Of these critical processes, only 30 percent are currently able to produce a product within predefined design standards. Manufacturing leading practices indicate that critical processes should be repeatable, sustainable, and consistent in producing parts within quality standards. Without these practices in place, the warfighter will continue to accept aircraft for delivery that are less reliable and more costly to maintain than originally planned. Additionally, parts shortages increased significantly in 2019 and Turkey's suspension from the program in July 2019 will likely further complicate existing supply chain challenges. Block 4 Development: The Block 4 program office has revised its Block 4 cost estimate from $10.6 billion to $12.1 billion and now expects to field Block 4 capabilities into fiscal year 2026. This new schedule adds 2 years to the cost estimate DOD reported to Congress in May 2019, and GAO found that reported Block 4 costs did not include all costs, including those incurred prior to 2018 or those that will be incurred after 2024. Without a complete cost estimate for Block 4, Congress is left without a complete picture of what DOD intends to spend on the total Block 4 effort.
The Secret Service provides protection for the President, Vice President, and their families at all times. In fiscal year 2017, the Secret Service provided protection for 30 presidential and vice-presidential foreign trips in addition to providing protection for members of the President's and Vice President's families. The Secret Service's Office of Investigations is responsible for investigating financial crimes, among other criminal investigations. GAO was asked to review the agency's protective operations. This report addresses the following objectives: (1) how, if at all, do Secret Service investigative operations support or negatively affect its protective operations; (2) to what extent do the agency and selected federal entities investigate similar financial crimes and do selected federal prosecutors find this to be beneficial; (3) the extent to which Secret Service has developed a plan to combat its priority criminal threats; and (4) to What extent does the Office of Investigation's staffing model ensure compensation limits are accounted for when estimating staffing needs? GAO analyzed Secret Service data for fiscal years 2014 through 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review, reviewed agency policies and guidance, and interviewed Secret Service officials and 40 current and former special agents. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service) supports protective operations by conducting protective intelligence investigations, building special agents' protection skills, and allowing the agency the flexibility to shift special agents from investigations to protection in campaign years and other protection-heavy periods. However, the agency has not identified which types of criminal investigations and related activities best prepare special agents for protective responsibilities, nor has it established a framework to help ensure that these agents gain experience in those areas to the extent possible. Federal prosecutors GAO interviewed said that the benefits of the Secret service and other selected federal agencies investigating similar types of financial crimes outweigh the drawbacks. For example, some federal prosecutors said that agencies' financial investigations are helpful to the law enforcement community as a whole, bringing specialized expertise to investigations and complementing investigations performed by other federal law enforcement agencies. For instance, one federal prosecutor noted that the occurrence of financial and cybercrimes in their district was pervasive, and that the number of criminal complaints they received far exceeded the numbers of federal agents available to investigate. In addition, agency collaboration can benefit criminal investigations, as in a June 2018 case in which the Department of Justice announced a coordinated effort to disrupt schemes designed to intercept and hijack wire transfers from businesses and individuals. The effort included an investigation by Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in which 23 individuals were charged in the Southern District of Florida with laundering at least $10 million. Although nine of 12 federal prosecutors stated that there are no drawbacks to the secret service investigating crimes similar to those investigated by selected federal officials, two of 12 prosecutors and one federal agency official identified drawbacks related to deconfliction and case assignment. TheSecret Service has defined its criminal investigative priorities, but does not have a documented process to ensure that resources are aligned with these priorities. The agency's 2017 Roadmap states that fiscal constraints require that the agency prioritize its efforts and take steps to ensure resources are aligning with its priorities. In December 2017, for example, the Roadmap stated the agency will counter the most significant criminal threats to the financial and payment systems of the United States through criminal investigations by focusing on three priority criminal threat areas: criminal activity with significant economic and financial impacts, such as cybersecurity threats, that operate at scale and present emergent or systemic risks to financial and payments systems, and transnational criminal activity involving corruption, illicit finance, fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. The Roadmap also states that the Secret Services will align enterprise-wide investigative activities from independent or uncoordinated cases into a systematic, well-prioritized, and targeted operation to counter the networks of transnational criminals that present risks to the nation's financial or payment systems. Documenting a process for identifying cases with national significance and coordinating related resources is not documented. Until the agency identifies cases that address priority threats and captures data on resources used to investigate these threats, agency management will not be able to determine the extent of resources and operations aligned with the priorities identified in the Road map. Since 2017, Secret Service field office management has employed a staffing model to determine how many special agents are necessary to sustain protective and investigative operations in its field offices. The staffing model takes into account the hours special agents work under the Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act and standard overtime
GAO was asked to review how federal agencies provide property to non-federal recipients. GAO's objectives were to examine (1) how selected agencies manage unneeded and excess property provided to these recipients, and (2) what is known about the benefits, effects, and reported data of providing property to such recipients. To address these objectives, GAO selected three agencies—the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Labor (DOL)—based on, among other things, the amount of property provided through their independent authorities and programs, and the amount provided through a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. These three agencies provided about $76 million in property to recipients in fiscal year 2017, according to GSA's Non-Federal Recipient Report, and GAO analyzed data from these agencies on property they provided to recipients from fiscal years 2013 to 2017, the most current data available at the time GAO started its review. The three agencies GAO reviewed—USDA, DOE, and DOL—each established regulations or guidance for managing the disposition of property during the internal-screening process and once it has been declared excess, but lacked insight into property use. For example, DOE's Office of Asset Management reported that it had discontinued monitoring the Economic Development Property program, which provides property to state and local governments for use in research, educational, technical, and scientific programs. DOE officials stated that they did not know when they had last monitored the program and were not informed of its activities, even though DOE reported to the General Services Administration (GSA) that the program provided over $154 million in excess property to federal recipients between fiscal years 2017 and 2013. DOE has previously acknowledged monitoring concerns with the program. As of December 2019, DOE had not issued any new guidance or clarifications on the program, or a time frame for when such guidance or clarification might be issued. In addition, DOL's Employment and Training Administration has provided excess property through cooperative agreements and memorandums of understanding with two apprenticeship programs to support the training of apprentices in the fields of heavy equipment operation and maintenance and sheet metal fabrication and installation, respectively. According to DOL officials, these agreements were terminated in 2016, but DOL has recently received independent statutory authority to provide excess property for purposes of training apprentices in those programs through grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or other arrangements. In fiscal year 2018, the department was authorized to provide up to $2 million in surplus property to apprenticeship training programs, but this authority expired at the end of the fiscal year 2019 appropriations. In September 2019 DOL approved the transfer of ownership of 96 items at a fair market value of about $1.7 million IUOE wished to retain and 75 items ITI wished to keep, for a total of $216,000 in the aggregate. For property that IUOE and ITI do not want to retain, such as obsolete equipment, Dol is in the process of disposing of it. DOL does not plan to transfer any additional property to these programs in the future because the authority provided in the 2018 and 2019 appropriations has expired. The government-wide data that GSA collects on how agencies provided property tonon-f federal recipients were unreliable for reporting purposes because of a lack of clarity in the reporting tool and accompanying bulletin. Specifically, the tool allows those who are inputting the information to select authorities or programs that are not specific to their agencies, rather than limiting options to the drop down menu of selections that actually are appropriate. As a result, it is difficult to understand how many agencies are providing property, or what authority they are using to do so. Also, agencies reported information incorrectly under their own programs. The full extent of such errors in unclear due to the inconsistency and incompleteness of the data, but GAO found clear examples of reporting errors that agency officials confirmed. For instance, DOE reported providing $104 million in loaned property ($104 million) to recipients, but DOE officials told GAO that they do not know if the data were accurate or complete, in part, because the officials were not aware the program existed and thus were not conducting any oversight.
CBP is responsible for securing the nation's borders against illegal immigration, including apprehending individuals attempting to enter the United States illegally through ports of entry. CBP's three operational components—Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Federal Offshore Operations (OFO), and AMO—are responsible for enforcing immigration laws, among other duties. In recent years, CBP has faced challenges in attracting and retaining qualified law enforcement personnel. In June 2018, GAO reported that CBP faced challenges retaining law enforcement officers in hard-to-fill locations. GAO was asked to update its June 2018 report. This statement discusses (1) CBPs efforts to recruit and hire law enforcement officials, (2) retention efforts, and (3) the extent to which CBP collects and analyzes data on departing officers and uses this information to inform retention efforts. To conduct this work, GAE reviewed CBP data on law enforcement officer and Border Patrol agent hiring from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 and interviewed CBP officials from all three CBP operational components, as well as officials from other federal, state, and local law enforcement organizations. From fiscal years 2015 through 2017, the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Transportation Security AdministrationCBPhave taken steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the hiring process for law enforcement positions. For example, in March 2017, DHS was granted the authority to waive the polygraph examination for veterans who meet certain criteria, including those who hold a current, active Top-Secret/Sensitive-Compartmented-Information clearance. Also, in April 2017 CBP received approval from the Office of Personnel Management to use direct-hire authority to expedite the typical hiring process by eliminating competitive rating and ranking procedures and veterans preference. As of March 31, 2018, 77 CBP officers and 107 Border Patrol agents had entered on duty through this authority. In addition, in fiscal year 2016, CBC reordered its hiring process to place the entrance examination as the first step directly after an applicant submitted an application, replacing a previous practice of conducting qualification reviews on applicants to ensure they met position requirements before inviting them to take the entrance exam. In November 2017, in response to Executive Order 13767, which called for CBP to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol Agents and 2,000 officers and 500 AMO personnel by fiscal year 2018, CBp hired a contractor to help it meet these staffing goals. In a June 2018 review of CBP’s recruitment and hiring efforts, we found that the agency had increased its emphasis on recruitment by establishing a central recruitment office and increasing its participation in recruitment events, but that it was too early to determine whether the contractor would be able to efficiently and effectively provide the surge hiring capacity CBP needs to achieve its staffing goals and that it has enhanced its retention efforts but does not systematically collect and analyze data on personnel leaving CBP. For fiscal year 2017, OFO paid a total of $149,000 in retention incentives to retain officers in four locations, including $84,000 to transfer three Air Interdiction Agents to Puerto Rico and $160,000 for seven relocation incentives to relocate personnel to the hard to-fill ports of Alcan and Nome, Alaska; Coburn Grove, Maine; and Detroit, Michigan. In February 2018, Border Patrol submitted a formal request to CBP leadership in February 2018 for a 10 percent across-the-board retention incentive for all agents at the GS-13 level and below, which represents the majority of the component's frontline workforce. According to Border Patrol documentation, these incentives, if implemented, could help reduce Border Patrol's attrition rate—which has consistently outpaced its hiring rate—by helping retain agents who may have otherwise left Border Patrol for similar positions in ICE, ICE, or other law enforcement agencies. As a result of its efforts, the number of applications it received for officer and agent positions across all three components increased from fiscal year 2013 to 2017. However, in June 2018 GAO found that while CBP did not have a systematic process for capturing and analyzing information on officers who are leaving, such as an exit interview or survey, the agency does not have important information it could use to help inform future retention efforts and made a recommendation to ensure that it systematically collects and analyze such data and uses it to inform its efforts to retain law enforcement staff. CBC agreed
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides or pays for long-term care for eligible veterans through a range of programs, including institutional and noninstitutional programs. In fiscal year 2018, VA spent $9.1 billion on these programs. GAO was asked to review VA's long- term care programs. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA has identified key challenges to meeting veterans' demand for care, (2) the utilization of and spending for VA long-Term Care in recent years, and (3) VA's projections for future demand and expenditures for long term care for veterans. To do this work, GAO analyzed VA data for fiscal years 2014 through 2018, reviewed VA strategic planning documents, interviewed VA officials, and reviewed VA data on utilization and spending. VA faces a number of key challenges in meeting the growing demand for longterm care, such as addressing workforce shortages, aligning care geographically, and meeting specialty care needs. These challenges are similar to challenges faced by other health care systems. However, while VA is aware of these challenges, its strategic planning has not identified measurable goals for addressing them. According to GAO's body of work on effectively managing performance under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), as enhanced by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, federal agencies should clarify and clearly define measurable outcomes for each strategic objective and assess progress towards those goals. VA officials told GAO that competing priorities, including implementation of the VA MISSION Act of 2018, have affected VA's ability to effectively address these challenges. Without measurable goals, however, VA is limited in its ability to better plan for and understand progress towards addressing the challenges it faces. VA data show that the number of veterans receiving care in one or more of its long- Term Care programs increased 14 percent from fiscal year 2014 to 2018, from 464,071 to 530,327 veterans. The data also show that utilization increased more for noninst institutional programs than for institutional programs. For example, the average daily census increased for two of VA's three institutional programs—Community Nursing Homes and State Veterans Homes—from 7,771 to 9,808 and 1 percent to 1 percent, respectively, over this period, while the average number of clinic stops for the Homemaker Home Health Aide program—which served approximately 23 percent of the veterans receiving non-institutional care in 2018—increased 48 percent from 8.3 million to 12.2 million. VA projects that utilization of VA long Term Care will increase from fiscal years 2017 through 2037, with expenditures for institutional long-year care increasing 71 percent and non-Institutional care increasing 168 percent. VA reports that these projections are based on expected increases in veterans' reliance on VA for their care through fiscal year 2037. These projected increases are due to a variety of factors, including that VA plans to continue expanding the availability of home- and community-based care and plans to provide care to an increasing number of aging veterans and veterans rated in the highest service-connected disability groups. VA also projects that the proportion of spending for institutional care will decrease from 63 percent to 53 percent, as the share for non- Institutional programs increases. VA has not fully addressed challenges at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) level that could lead to inefficient and inequitable decisions about veterans' care. First, VA identified that VAMCs do not have a consistent approach to managing VA's 14 long-time care programs at the VAMC level. Second, VA has developed a tool to improve the consistency with which VAMs determine the amount of services needed for veterans based on their specific health issues, but has not required the tool to be used in all VAMFs. Third, although VA identified steps it can take to improve consistency, according to officials, it has not prioritized their implementation. Without a reliably consistent approach, VA may not consistently and equitably meet veterans' needs.
The Air Force is developing OCX to replace the current GPS ground system with a modernized and more cybersecure system that enables M-code—a stronger, encrypted, military-specific GPS signal designed to meet military positioning, navigation, and timing needs. It will help military users overcome GPS signal jamming by using a more powerful signal and protect against false GPS signals, known as spoofing, by encrypting the signal. OCX is being developed by Raytheon Company (Raytheon) and is expected to be ready to transition to operations by April 2023. The House Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the status of OCX. This report examines the extent to which schedule risks may delay the delivery, acceptance, and approval for the operation of the next generation operational control system (OCX). To do this work, GAO assessed the full schedule—which includes the prime contractor's schedule, government acceptance and post-acceptance government-run developmental testing—until the system is ready for operations. GAO also reviewed relevant reports and assessments and interviewed officials from the Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Air Force's Global Positioning System (GPS) Next Generation Operational Control System ( OCX) program is at risk for additional delays to delivery and will likely be delayed, potentially exceeding the April 20 23 threshold date for completing the program. Actual development progress has been mixed, with some improvement to the pace of software development. However, the majority of the schedule reserve has been consumed and defect repairs are taking longer than assumed with significant work remaining. In addition, a number of new cost and schedule risks to OCX delivery have arisen since the program schedule was established. As a result, the program's estimated completion date of June 2021 has been pushed back to June 2023, which will likely delay OCX's acceptance to operations until after the end of fiscal year 2023 at the earliest. While the program plans to continue assessing schedule progress, there are no plans in place for an independent schedule assessment. The program's history has consistently shown program and contractor estimates to be optimistic and that independent assessments have provided useful insights about risks as well as past experience with similar activities. The Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation has conducted independent cost estimates which account for a full program schedule when statutorily required, but has not conducted a full schedule assessment since June 2018. Without such an assessment, decision makers may lack updated information when determining whether to take new steps to avoid or mitigate additional delays.
In May 2014, the DATA Act required OMB to establish a pilot program to facilitate the development of recommendations for (1) standardized reporting elements across the federal government, (2) elimination of unnecessary duplication in financial reporting, and (3) reduction of compliance costs for recipients of federal awards. To meet these requirements, OMB established a pilot with two components—one that focused on federal grants and another on federal contracts (procurement). OMB designated HHS as the executing agency of the grants portion of the pilot with oversight from OFFM. OFPP was responsible for designing and leading the procurement portion. The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 included a provision for GAO to review the pilot program. This report assesses the extent to which the pilot demonstrated changes in federal award recipients' reporting burden. To do this, GAO reviewed OMB's August 2017 report to Congress, pilot plans, and other documents related to the pilot, and interviewed OMB and HHS officials. The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) conducted six grant test models to determine if adopting proposed changes would contribute to the Section 5 Pilot's objectives of reducing federal award recipient reporting burden and duplication. GAO found that evidence from the test models supported all three recommendations for streamlining federal reporting discussed in OMBs August 2017 reports to Congress. For example, the report recommended that OMB standardize core data elements used for managing federal financial assistance awards based on reductions in administrative burden experienced in the Common Data Element Repository (CDER) Library 1 test model. The CDER Library 1 is an online repository for federal grants-related data standards, definitions, and context. The library is intended to be an authorized source for data elements and definitions for use by the government and for recipients reporting grant information. The report also recommended eliminating duplication through auto-population of data from existing federal data sources and leveraging information technology open standards to develop new tools across the government. The procurement portion of this pilot did not result in data collection that could be used for an evidence-based assessment of ways to reduce reporting burden because of a lack of contractor participation and the absence of iterative and ongoing stakeholder engagement and engagement throughout the pilot. In November 2017, OFPP expanded the type of data accepted by the pilot to include hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) reporting, a new Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) reporting requirement. However, this choice had limitations in its suitability for providing useful data for testing the hypotheses of the five procurement test models. Unlike Davis-Bacon reporting, where contractors submit weekly reports, HFC is an annual reporting requirement for contractors that emit HFC gases over a certain threshold. The Central Reporting Portal is the only location where contractors can submit HFC reporting. For the purposes of the procurement pilot, the Central Reporting portal accepted HFC submissions from November 2017 through February 2018. During this period, only 11 HFC annual reports were submitted to the portal. As a result of the small number of HFC reports collected, the pilot collected much less data than OMB had initially expected to receive to test the capabilities of the portal, which could have theoretically resulted in 9,360 submissions for analysis. OMB has announced its intention to expand centralized reporting for FAR requirements across government, but it has not yet determined how it will do so. The pilot also did not collect data on the existing reporting burden that could have been used to assess changes in reporting burden, and therefore OMB did not assess how centralized reporting could reduce burden. In addition, the procurement program did not conduct pilot outreach activities with the contractors, who were key to successful implementation of the pilots. The lack of information from stakeholders—including the contractors who would use the portal—raises concerns about the future success of plans for expanding the Central reporting portal.
This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO’s April 2019 report, GAO-19-722 . GAO found that all nine selected agencies have policies that are generally consistent with the Office of Science and Technology Policy's (OSTP) guidance for two principles of scientific integrity that GAO reviewed: (1) foundations of scientific Integrity in government and (2) professional development of government scientists and engineers. GAO also found that seven of the nine agencies have specific, documented procedures for identifying and addressing alleged violations of their scientific integrity policies. In contrast, two of the selected agencies—the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)—do not have specific procedures for addressing alleged scientific integrity violations, raising questions about the consistency of their investigations. In March 2009, the President issued a memorandum on scientific integrity, which states that each agency should have in place procedures to identify and address instances in which the scientific process or the integrity of scientific and technological information may be compromised. The memorandum also states that the Secretary of Energy should designate a scientific integrity official to lead and coordinate with other elements of the department to develop procedures to address alleged violations. DOE has not yet designated such an official. In January 2017, as the administration was changing, DOE implemented its scientific integrity policy, but the current Secretary has not designated an official to oversee the department's scientific integrity activities. NASA follows DOE's policy but does not have any specific procedures because the agency has not established any. NASA officials said employees can report allegations to a supervisor, the whistleblower ombudsperson, or the U.S. Office of Special Counsel for investigation on a case-by-case basis. However, without documented procedures, DOE and NASA do not have assurance that all staff have a clear understanding of how to report allegations and that investigations will be conducted consistently. In April 2019 GAO recommended that the Department of Energy (DOE) and NASA develop documented procedures. In written comments on a draft of GAO's report, DOE stated that it will develop procedures by October 2020. NASA has estimated completing actions in June 2020. The nine agencies GAO selected for review have taken some actions to help achieve the objectives of their science integrity policies in the three areas reviewed—communicating information to staff, providing oversight, and monitoring and evaluating performance—but opportunities exist for furthering those objectives. For example, according to GAOs analysis, 7 of the 9 agencies have taken actions to educate and communicate to staff about their policies, and 2 have not. In addition, 4 of 9 selected agencies monitor and evaluate the performance of their activities under their policies or have plans to do so. The remaining 5 agencies have, for different reasons, not done so. By taking action, these agencies would have better assurance that employees have the information, skills, and competencies they need to help them achieve agency scientific integrity objectives. In its draft of a report GAO issued in April 2019, GA OMB recommended that DOE and the other agencies develop mechanisms to regularly monitor implementation of their policies and make improvements where necessary. In response, in May 2019, DOT identified mechanisms it plans to implement by March 2020.
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is responsible for managing billions of dollars in foreign assistance funding. In 2017, in response to Executive Order 13781 and subsequent guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), USAID launched several reform efforts, including a reform plan submitted to OMB in September 2017. GAO was asked to review USAID's reform efforts. This report (1) examines the status of the reform efforts and (2) assesses the extent to which USAID has addressed key practices and considerations critical to the successful planning and implementation of agency reforms. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed USAID reform plans, proposals, and related documents and interviewed officials involved in the agency's reform effort. The scope of GAO's review was limited to internal USAID efforts and did not include government-wide or interagency reform proposals, such as those referenced in OMB's Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century report. The Department of State (State) and USAID established the Transformation Task Team (T3) in June 2017 to plan and lead reform efforts at USAID. USAID also participated in a joint State-USAID redesign process during mid-2017, which resulted in the development of a joint reform plan. In January 2018, USAID suspended its participation in the joint redesign process and continued to implement its own internal reforms. In June 2018, in a report to assist Congress, OMB, and agencies in assessing agency reform plans GAO recommended that USAID complete a strategic workforce plan to help ensure that it has the right people in the right place at the right time to achieve its reform goals. USAid has taken a number of steps since 2017 to develop an agency-wide workforce plan both prior to and during the current reform effort, including developing staff realignment plans as part of its process for standing up the proposed new bureau structures. However, the agency has not yet developed or implemented the data collection and measurement tools that it identified as necessary to gauge current workforce capabilities, assess staffing needs arising from the proposed reorganization, and identify ways to close gaps arising from changes in workforce requirements. As a result, it is unclear whether its current or planned workforce requirements align with its reform and reorganization objectives. In addition, the lack of a workforce planning tool may limit USAIDs efforts to estimate how its proposed headquarters reorganization will affect future staffing needs. As of July 2019, as of the date of this report, USAid had completed 19 reform projects and is implementing 12 others, all of which it intends to complete by 2021. The task team also has one project still in the planning phase. In order to develop and implement the 32 reform projects, the task team has identified approximately $33 million in estimated costs associated with its reforms up through April 2019. According to USAID, this total includes about $3 million to develop the T3 reform efforts in fiscal year 2018 and approximately $6 million to implement the reform effort over a period of 2 years, which it assumes will cover fiscal years 2019 and 2020. In May 2018, the Task Team issued a task order for a contractor to provide project and performance management support, including tracking projects, providing summaries and executive reports on the progress of USAID projects, and also knowledge management, including the retention of key documents and information related to performance management. The contractor has developed guidance for transferring responsibility for project implementation to the appropriate bureaus and offices, among other items, and has completed bureau handover plans for 24 T3 projects. The Task Team also has demonstrated transparency over its reform efforts through publicizing reform-related information on its website, including fact sheets on its projects. In July and August 2018, to streamline operations and gain efficiencies, in July USAID sent to various congressional committees for approval a series of initiatives to restructure its headquarters organizational structure. The congressional committees had not yet approved all of these proposals as of June 2019, according to the agency. In its fiscal year 2020 budget justification, for example, it identified a need for 40 additional Civil Service positions to “refocus Washington bureau and offices toward being effective service providers to the field consistent with the vision of ending the need of foreign assistance.” USAID requested $7.2 million to fund those positions in the restructured bureaux.
Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017, resulting in an estimated $70 billion in damage to the island's economy and an estimated loss of life of about 70 percent. In response to the request of the Governor of Puerto Rico, the President declared each hurricane a major disaster, which can trigger a variety of federal response and recovery programs for government and nongovernmental entities, households, and individuals, including assistance through FEMA's Public Assistance program. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included a provision for GAO to review Puerto Rico's recovery efforts. This report examines, among other things, (1) the amount of Public Assistance funding FEMA obligated for Puerto Rico and (2) the extent to which Puerto Rico has expended Public Assistance funds. GAO reviewed FEMA and Puerto Rico documents related to Public Assistance and interviewed officials from FEMA, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Board (COR3), Puerto Rico government agencies, and municipalities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) obligated almost $4 billion in Public Assistance in Puerto Rico as of September 30, 2018, for emergency work and permanent work projects, as well as $136 million for management and administrative costs. Puerto Rico expended about $1.7 billion (about 43 percent) of these funds. FEMA obligated $3.63 billion (93 percent) in emergency work, and $151 million (4 percent) for permanent work (categories C through G). Puerto Rico is developing an internal controls plan and recovery management policies and procedures to provide oversight of federal recovery funds, and FEMA has instituted a manual reimbursement process to mitigate risk and ensure fiscal accountability. FEMA officials stated that they decided to institute this process because Puerto Rico had expended funds prior to submitting complete documentation of work performed and because of weaknesses in FEMA's internal controls. FEMA, COR3, and municipality government officials from ten municipalities GAO interviewed reported initial challenges with the recovery process, including with Public Assistance alternative procedures. These concerns included workforce capacity constraints, a need for additional guidance, delays related to choosing cost estimators, and reimbursement foremergency work. FEMA and municipality officials cited concerns about FEMA staff turnover and lack of knowledge about how the Public assistance alternative procedures are to be applied in Puerto Puerto Rico. In addition, municipalities cited problems with missing, incomplete, or conflicting guidance from FEMA. According to FEMA officials, they are drafting supplemental guidance for the alternative procedures process with the goal of incorporating lessons learned from prior iterations. COR3 is currently developing additional guidance and standard operating procedures to help subrecipients better understand FEMA Public Assistance grant requirements. In August 2018, Puerto Rico submitted an economic and disaster recovery plan (recovery plan) to Congress that defines the priorities, goals, and expected outcomes of its recovery related to infrastructure, housing, electric power systems, and grid restoration. The recovery plan estimates infrastructure repair and recovery costs of $132 billion and total recovery cost of $139 billion for a time period starting in 2018 and ending in 2028. The Recovery Support Function Leadership Group led by FEMA provided Puerto Rico with technical assistance to develop the recovery plan, but Puerto Rico will be responsible for its implementation. The plan is intended to serve as a focal point for strategic thought and management of the recovery effort and is generally responsive to the directives outlined in the Bip bipartisan budget act of 2018, including submitting the plan to Congress within 180 days of enactment.
DOD's 2018 National Defense Strategy calls for the department to make difficult choices to prioritize what is most important to field a lethal, resilient, and rapidly adapting joint force needed to address the growing threats to U.S. security. It also emphasizes that this environment demands analysis that accepts uncertainty and complexity and can drive innovation among rapidly changing threats. To prepare the joint force for the threats identified in the strategy, the department's leadership needs to be supported by timely and comprehensive analyses. However, DOD's current approach for providing such analytic support—the Support for Strategic Analysis (SSA)—has not provided the comprehensive analyses that senior leaders need to make informed decisions. GAO was asked to review DOD's approach for supporting senior leaders in making force structure decisions. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has provided senior leaders with the analytic support they need to evaluate and make fully informed decisions regarding the force structure needed to implement the National Defense strategy and (2) the challenges that have affected SSA's ability to provide such support. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant DOD guidance, analyzed SSA products, and interviewed DOD officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) established its approach in 2002 to provide analytic support to senior leaders as they deliberate strategy and budget matters and to support evaluations of force structure needs across the force. SSA is structured to do this by providing a common set of assumptions for various military threats that form the basis for further analysis across the department. DOD guidance states that SSA was intended to provide a common starting point for the exploration of various approaches to address these threats. DOD officials told GAO that the department developed what became SSA because then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was frustrated by the lack of objective measures to compare competing force structure proposals during the 1990s. DOD senior leaders have documented in relevant guidance that there are cracks in DOD's analytic foundation, many of which originate with SSA. This is due in part to highly detailed and complex products that are difficult to produce and lack flexibility to analyze, insufficient guidance to overcome the interests of the services to protect their force structure equities, and a lack of a joint analytic capability. DOD has recognized this and has attempted to reform SSA for several years, including exploring alternative options for providing senior leaders better decision-making support. For example, the Joint Staff has reinvigorated its own analytic capability to support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other senior DOD leaders, and the Tri-Chairs have undertaken an effort to identify an alternative approach to SSA, but these efforts are in the early stages and it is unclear whether they will be completed. Based on GAO's analysis, DOD faces three interrelated and persistent challenges that impede its ability to fully support senior leaders' ability to make well-informed decisions regarding force structure changes. First, DOD has not kept the products it uses to support senior leader decisions complete and up-to-date because they are cumbersome and inflexible. Second, the services have been reluctant to independently examine a broad range of innovative force structure options and conduct sensitivity analysis on key operational assumptions because, according to service officials, due to competing priorities, they believe they can generally only affect marginal changes in their budgets from year to year and have limited analytic capacity. Third, DOD does not have a mechanism in place for senior leaders to routinely assess joint force needs and force structure tradeoffs across the military services. In 2016, DOD identified this as an issue, and limited progress has been made since then to ensure adequate joint analysis to support decisionmaking. Without determining the analytic products needed and updating them, issuing specific guidance requiring alternatives and key assumptions to be fully analyzed, and developing an approach for conducting joint analyses, DOD may not be providing its leaders with needed support to prioritize force structure investments that would best manage risk and address the threats outlined in the national defense strategy.
The U.S. commercial airline industry relies on a wide variety of information technology (IT) systems to manage its operations, including reservations, crew scheduling, and flight dispatch. These systems touch all phases of a passenger's travel experience, including booking, check-in, boarding, and baggage, as well as airline operations behind the scene, such as flight planning and crew scheduling. In recent years, the introduction of new mobile applications and telecommunications infrastructure has added to the myriad systems and network connections now critical to an airline's operations. GAO was asked to review airline IT outages. This report identifies (1) the Department of Transportation's (DOT) and Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) roles, if any, in relation to airline outages and their effects and (2) what is known about these outages, including the number of flights and passengers affected. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance; analyzed DOT and FAA data; and interviewed DOT and airline officials and other stakeholders. DOT reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical clarifications, which GAO incorporated into the report as appropriate. DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) collects data on airline on-time performance, including flight delays and cancellations, and reports these data to DOT, but does not require airlines to report these data on their own. DOT officials noted that obtaining more detailed information on the causes of flight delays would require a cost and benefit analysis to determine whether the benefit from collecting the data would exceed the airlines' cost to report the data. No data are publicly available to quantify with any degree of precision how many passengers were affected by airline IToutages, and available information is largely anecdotal. However, based on a review of a preliminary list of 34 outages GAO identified from 2015 through 2017, it found that the number and severity of flight disruptions associated with the outages varied widely. For example, about 85 percent (29 of 34) of the identified outages resulted in some flight disruptions, including 5 outages that caused over 800 flight delays or cancellations. The remaining 7 outages had no associated flight disruptions but inconvenienced customers in other ways, including problems buying tickets online, checking into flights on an airline website, or using frequent flier benefits. Because no comprehensive data are available on airline ITOutage effects on passengers, the extent to which these effects could be seen in the BTS performance data reported by airlines is not known. DOT is responsible for helping ensure airlines' compliance with passenger protection requirements and educating passengers on their rights. Airline IT Outages are not specifically addressed by any of DOT's consumer protection regulations, but when they occur, they may trigger broader consumer protections afforded passengers. For instance, airlines are required by DOT's interpretation of the statutory prohibition on unfair and deceptive practices to provide refunds for flights that are canceled or significantly delayed if a passenger declines any rerouting that the airline may offer. In the case of delay, however, what amounts to a significant delay is not defined in this policy, and individual airlines may or may not set their own thresholds. As a result, airlines' contracts of carriage for the airlines in GAO's review vary in terms of what accommodations are provided for, and the extent of which airlines have discretion in providing them. While several airline contracts include provisions to provide hotel vouchers, transportation to the hotel, or meals, other airlines--notably several low-cost carriers--do not. Likewise, some airlines establish set time thresholds for when they are obligated to provide a certain accommodation (e.g., after a delay of at least 4 hours), while others do not. In addition, while passengers are not entitled to monetary compensation for a flight delay or cancellation in the United States, two airlines provide for travel credit—above and beyond a refund—for flight disruptions in their contracts. In some cases, additional accommodations may be publicly announced on airline websites, by social media accounts, or through statements to the press.
Federal trust funds and other dedicated funds are accounts designated as a “trust fund” by law that are credited with collections that are generally available for obligation without further appropriation action to carry out a cycle of businesslike operations in accordance with statute. GAO was asked to review federal trust funds. This report examines (1) how the size and scope of these accounts have changed over time, (2) the extent to which they are supported by their dedicated collections, and (3) how they support mandatory programs, including major entitlement programs. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed OMB budget data for fiscal years 2014 to 2018, reviewed 13 case study accounts in nine agencies selected to include the largest of each of the four types of trust funds, reviewed agency financial, budget, and performance reports, and interviewed agency officials. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) reviewed a draft of this report and had no comments. The Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Federal trust funds were a large and growing part of the federal budget from fiscal year (FY) 2014 to FY 2018. Every major department has at least two federal trust fund or other dedicated fund accounts. The total balance in these accounts grew about 13 percent in nominal terms from FY2014 to FY2018. The five accounts that contributed the most to this overall growth were the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI), the Federal Disability Insurance Fund (DI), Federal Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance (Medicare), Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund (Federal Employee Health Benefits), Federal Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF), and Federal Airport and Airway Trust Fund. While the net change in total trust fund balances was positive, not all accounts grew over the time period. For example, five accounts experienced the largest balance decreases, and a greater number of accounts increased than decreased over the period. The majority of the 23 largest trust funds GAO reviewed have entitlement authority, which legally requires payments to individuals or governments that meet the requirements of the programs. Although entitlements represent a current legal commitment, the government can change the terms of entitlement programs by changing the substantive law by raising or lowering future trust fund collections or changing the purposes for which the collections can be used. Most large trust funds have some mandatory budget authority, but not entitlement authority. During FY 2018, almost 98 percent of outgo (i.e., outlays and transfers to another government account) from trust funds was mandatory, which means it was available to be spent without further appropriations. This is greater than the proportion of total federal spending that is mandatory. According to OMB, mandatory spending made up 69.3 percent of all federal outlays while discretionary spending accounted for the remaining 30.7 percent. The federal government has previously enacted fiscal rules in the form of laws that constrain fiscal policy decisions, including the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. These fiscal rules apply the same way regardless of status as a trust fund. However, in practice, fiscal rules that apply to mandatory spending are more relevant to these types of accounts, because mandatory spending is more concentrated in trust funds than it is in the federal government as a whole.
This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's December 2018 report, entitled Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Pipeline Security: Actions Needed to Address Weaknesses in Pipeline Security Program Management ( GAO-2019-10-854 ). The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Agency (T TSA) is responsible for securing the nation's transportation infrastructure, including the nations pipelines. Pipeline operators rely on pipelines to transport billions of gallons of natural gas, oil, electricity, and other products and services each day. Pipeline operations are critical to the security of the U.S. transportation system. GAO was asked to testify on the findings and recommendations from its report on pipeline security. This testimony is based on that report. For that report, GAO analyzed TSA data on pipeline safety and security, interviewed TSA officials and representatives from 10 pipeline operators and industry associations, and reviewed TSA Pipeline Security Guidelines and other relevant documents. The results of these interviews are not generalizable to all pipeline operators, but provided insights on TSAS pipeline security program management. TSA conducts pipeline security reviews to assess pipeline vulnerabilities and industry implementation of TSA’s pipeline security guidelines. However, the number of reviews conducted has varied widely from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. For example, as of July 31, 2018, TSA had conducted 23 security reviews of critical pipeline systems, compared to zero reviews conducted in fiscal year 2014. TSA officials reported that staffing limitations had prevented TSA from conducting more reviews. TSA also has not developed a strategic workforce plan for its Pipeline Security Branch to determine the number, skills, and abilities needed to effectively conduct these reviews. In addition, TSA has developed a risk assessment model that combines all three elements of riskthreat, vulnerability, and consequenceto generate a risk score for each of the 100 most critical pipeline system and ranks them according to risk, which was information used by TSA to prioritize pipeline security assessments. In its 2018 report GAO found that the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Toola tool TSA uses to rank pipeline systems based on the amount of material transported through the systemhad not been updated since 2014, and TSA had not tracked the status of recommendations for security improvements in over 5 yearsinformation necessary for TSA to effectively monitor pipeline operators progress in improving their security posture. TSA has taken some steps to address these recommendations, such as updating its Pipeline Risk Ranking tool to reflect current industry data, but GAO is currently reviewing those steps to determine if they sufficiently address GAO s recommendation. In December 2018 GAO also found that TSA lacked clarity in the definition of key terms used to determine critical facilities. TSA initially identifies the 100 highest risk pipeline systems and requires pipeline operators to self-identify the critical facilities within those higher risk systems and report them to TSA. TSA then conducts critical facility reviews at the identified critical facilities, but at least 34 of the top 100 systems TSA deemed highest risk indicated that they had no critical facilities at all. TSA does not have clearly defined criteria for determining pipeline facilities criticality, which means that TSA cannot ensure that pipeline operators are applying guidance uniformly, that all critical facilities across the pipeline sector have been identified, or that their vulnerabilities have be identified and addressed. TSA is in the process of clarifying its criteria for identifying critical facilities and estimated that this effort would be completed by June 30, 2019. TSA issued revised Pipeline Security guidelines in March 2018, but had not established a documented process to ensure that revisions occur and fully capture updates to supporting standards and guidance. In April 2018, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released version 1.1 of its Cybersecurity Framework, which contains cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices that may be scaled and applied to address a pipeline operator's cybersecurity risks. The guidelines were revised to, among other things, reflect the dynamic threat environment and to incorporate cybersecurity principles and practices from the Framework, but did not incorporate cybersecurity elements that NIST added to the Framework in April 2018. In March 2019, TSA officials stated that they have taken steps to document a process for reviewing and, if deemed necessary, revising the guidelines.
HUD's WCF was established in 2016 to provide a mechanism for the department to centralize and fund federal shared services used across HUD offices and agencies. The WCF is different from other intragovernmental revolving funds that GAO has previously reviewed in that it does not fund internally provided services at this time. GAO was asked to review the WCF. This report examines (1) the extent to which HUD has defined roles and responsibilities and assessed results for achieving operational and cost efficiencies, and (2) HUD's processes to recover the W CF's costs and develop and document policies for its unexpended balances and operating reserve. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed HUD policies and procedures, interviewed HUD officials, and conducted three focus groups with WCF customers. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Working Capital Fund (WCF) Division within the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) oversees the day-to-day operations and cost accounting of the fund and provides financial and operational oversight to customers. HUD defines most of the roles and responsibility for management and oversight of theWCF. However, HUD does not fully define roles or assess the results of the business process analyses conducted by the Division to identify opportunities for efficiencies. For example, in 2018, in response to an increase in the volume of two service areas overseen by OCFO—help desk calls and commercial purchase order accruals—the WCF Division examined data and determined that HUD could reduce its service volume and costs. In addition, the Division identified potential efficiencies that it could track that would contribute to cost savings over time, such as more than $1 million in potential annual savings from improving the quality of services that it is capable of tracking. While the Division has a process for identifying efficiencies through the analyses, it has not defined and documented the Division's own role and responsibilities with regard to the analyses. Without doing so, HUD risks not fully realizing the potential savings identified by the analyses and freeing up resources that could be realigned for other departmental priorities. In response to GAO's review, HUD updated its WCF Handbook—the primary reference guide for customers and stakeholders on WCF operations—to include more current and complete information on policies, procedures, and performance metrics. HUD has established a process to recover WCF costs and has fully developed and documented policies for Unexpended Balances. To recover its costs for financing HUD's annual shared service agreements, HUD divides HUD's total cost of shared services among the 17 WCF customer offices based on their estimated service usage. For fiscal years 2016 through 2018, the fund reported a negative accumulated operating result of $400,372, meaning that it reported it recovered nearly all of its costs since its inception. HUD's shared service providers set annual prices for each service line at the outset of the fiscal year using their own pricing methodologies. The service providers then bill HUD in aggregate for an agreed-upon price under annual interagency agreements at firm-fixed prices. The Division determines how much each customer office will pay for its respective share of HUD's share of shared service costs using internally developed cost drivers and customers' expected service usage, which are subject to annual review. According to WCF officials, the cost drivers are generally similar to those established by the external providers to maintain a clear connection between customer usage and provider charges. In some cases, however, the provider uses a nonunit based cost driver, suchAs "level of effort." In those instances, the WAF Division uses cost drivers which vary from the providers. In these cases, the costs of the shared services are paid for by HUD customers. In fiscal year 2017, HUD began to bill its customers directly for their estimated use of services financed through the fund. HUD officials told GAO that they plan to expand the fund in the future to finance both internal and additional external goods and services. HUD could maximize the potential of these opportunities by ensuring that it has a solid framework in place before it expands to include additional shared services.
Veterans diagnosed with mental health conditions rely on providers in VA medical centers (VAMC) across the country to make treatment decisions that are safe and effective, including whether to treat highly prevalent and serious conditions such as MDD and PTSD with psychotropic medications, non-pharmacologic therapy, or a combination of both. GAO was asked to review issues related to mental health care for veterans. This report examines (1) the extent to which VHA has examined suicide risk among veterans using psychotropic medication and (2) the factors that contribute to providers' decisions to prescribe psychotropic drugs and offer non- pharmacologic therapy to veterans. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and VHA policies and procedures; reviewed a nongeneralizable, randomly selected sample of 75 veterans' medical records from five VAMCs—25 for each of the three most prevalent conditions diagnosed among veterans—who had at least one primary care visit in fiscal year 2017; and interviewed VHA officials. Since 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care Financing Administration's (VHA) Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and VAMC clinical pharmacy specialists have taken steps aimed at improving the safety and effectiveness of prescribing decisions for certain medications used to treat veterans with certain mental health Conditions. For example, in 2013, VHA launched the Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI), which has consisted of three phases. PDSI is currently in phase 3, with a new phase scheduled to begin in July 2019. VHA reported nationwide improvements in 16 of the 20 metrics it developed for phase 1, and all 14 of the metrics that it developed in phase 2. However, VA has yet to disseminate guidance that clearly reflects its expectation that mental health providers in specialty care document mental health treatment plans in an easily identifiable way. Standards for internal control in the federal government require that agencies document responsibilities through policies and define objectives in terms that are understood at all levels. Absent such guidance, providers may incorrectly record treatment plans such that they are not easily identifiable. As a result, there is a risk that a provider may be unable to readily access important information about a veteran's treatment, including the use of psychotropic or non-psychotropic medication, during changes in care. VA officials GAO interviewed reported various factors as contributing to their decisions to prescribing psychotropic and non-Pharmacologic therapies to veterans, including VA resources, complexity of veterans' mental health condition, comfort level of providers with treating conditions or prescribing medications, veterans' preferences, and logistics of receiving mental healthtreatment. In addition, providers' use of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) established by VA and Department of Defense may also contribute to treatment decisions. All five of the VAMFs in GAO's review have formal service agreements to help coordinate mental health services across outpatient settings. These agreements indicate that, for example, providers in primary care can provide treatment for certain conditions, such as uncomplicated depression, without referring veterans to a mental health provider in a specialty care setting. In light of these factors, providers GAO spoke with reported that more providers reported that psychotrop medications are commonly prescribed to veterans with MDD, PTSD, or GAD prior to referring them to specialty care, compared to providers who reported that it is common to prescribe without referring patients to a specialist. Providers also reported on the degree to which it was common for any provider to offer therapy instead of medication to veterans in lieu of, or in addition to, prescribing medications. VHHA has not developed and disseminated guidance that specifies its expectation for mental health service providers to document treatment plans that are easily identifiable and separate from other health information within veterans' records. According to VA officials, it is important for a provider to document each veterans' treatment plan in such a manner so that the provider, or any other providers who may become involved in the veteran's care, can readily refer to the plan as they evaluate progress. In a review of 80 medical records for veterans who were seen by specialty care providers and prescribed a psychotropic drug, GAOs found that a majority (50 of 80) had a treatment plan recorded in a progress note, but GAO viewed several examples where the plan was not the only information recorded within the note, making it difficult to readily identify the treatment plan itself. VA does not have an approach for monitoring whether providers are documenting their consideration of different evidence-based treatment options
DOD's FMS program is intended to strengthen the security of the United States and partner countries by selling a variety of items and services to foreign partners, such as fighter jets and integrated air and missile defense systems, and providing training on the use of items. DOD charges purchasers a transportation fee to transport FMS items to and from their final destinations. The Transportation Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) within the Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for managing the FMS transportation accounts. GAO was asked to review DSCA's oversight of the transportation account balances. This report examines (1) the balances maintained in the transportation accounts for fiscal years 2007 through 2018, (2) the extent to which D SCA has established and implemented policies and procedures to help ensure management oversight of these accounts, and (3) the degree to which processes for setting transportation fee rates ensure that these rates are set appropriately. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed fiscal year 2007 to 2018 overall collections, expenditures, and balance data for each of the individual transportation accounts, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed DOD officials. The combined balance of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's (DFAS) Foreign Military Sales (FMS) transportation accounts grew by over 1,300 percent from fiscal years 2017 to 2018, from $46 million to $680 million, or 1,378 percent. Much of this growth occurred from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2018, during which time the account grew by approximately $630 million. This substantial recent balance growth was in contrast to balance activity from 2007 to 2011, when the collections into the account more closely approximated the expenditures from the account. Collections and expenditures for the account fluctuated from year to year, but collections have outpaced expenditures since 2014, particularly for the main transportation account, which has grown more quickly than the combined seven BPC accounts. For example, the main account's balance grew by 316 percent from $140 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2013 to $582 million in 2018, while the combined BPC account balance increased by 88 percent during the same time period. DSC a has limited management oversight guidance for the FMCSA transportation accounts that has contributed to their substantial balance growth. In fiscal year 2016, DSCa established a Managers' Internal Control Program (MICP) for overseeing the accounts, which formalized two management oversight processes for the accounts—daily and annual reviews—to ensure that the accounts have sufficient funds to pay expenses. The MICP procedures include flow charts that explain certain steps that should be included in each of these reviews, a risk assessment that explains how each process mitigates risks, and test procedures that lay out expectations for how each MICP process should be conducted so that DSC A can periodically test to ensure the processes were carried out as intended. However, the guidance for these processes is unclear and lacks key details. As a result, the implementation of these processes lacks rigor, and DOD's reporting to its management has not included complete information about the causes for recent account growth. For instance, the annual reports on the financial health of the accounts contained incomplete information on the underlying causes for account trends and omitted key details about the source of $130 million that had been redistributed from the administrative fee account in fiscal years 2009 to 2011 to address a danger of insolvency that the FSCA transportation accounts no longer face. Without clear internal guidance on how to assess when redistributions are needed and when to return unused BPC-specific transportation funds to the Treasury, DOD may not have accurate information on or sufficient oversight of its budgetary resources and account balances, and funds that could be put to other uses may remain in the BPC transportation accounts after the related programs close and those remaining funds are no longer needed. In addition, DOD has no internal guidance to ensure proper disposition of any funds remaining in these accounts after they close, which risks these funds not being transferred as DOD officials told GAO DOD intends to do.
Federal law and regulations provide special hiring authorities for people with disabilities, including Schedule A excepted service hiring authority—which permits the noncompetitive appointment of qualified individuals with intellectual, severe physical, or psychiatric disabilities and appointments and noncompetitive conversion for veterans who are 30 percent or more disabled. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' efforts to hire and retain individuals with disabilities in the federal government. This report examines (1) the extent to which federal agencies met the hiring and retention goals set forth in Executive Order 13548 and (2) how selected agencies have used various practices to increase the number of employees with disabilities and targeted disabilities in federal employment. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Department of Labor (Labor), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Social Security Administration for fiscal years 2011 through 2017 (the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review). GAO also interviewed officials from these agencies. Federal agencies exceeded the government-wide goal to hire an additional 100,000 persons with disabilities by 2015, but OPM does not routinely track or report retention data on these employees, which could help to pinpoint the root causes of the high rate of departure. The federal government hired an additional 143,600 persons with disability in all positions, including full-time permanent and part-time and temporary positions, between fiscal year 2011 and 2015. Of those hires, approximately 87,000—61 percent—were hired into full- time permanent positions. Similar hiring continued to increase in 2016 and 2017, with an additional 79,600—62 percent—hired in full-Time Permanent Positions. The percentage of hires with disabilities steadily increased from 11 percent to almost 20 percent over the same time period, and almost all agencies increased the percentage of persons with targeted disabilities hired during this time period. The three agencies GAO selected as case illustrations—the Department of Justice (DOJ), SBA, and SSA—used various practices, such as collaboration with other federal agencies for knowledge and information sharing and coordination with employee resource and advisory groups, to increase hiring of individuals with disability. For example, DOJ's Attorney General's Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities meets quarterly and works with DOJ management on disability employment issues. SSA's employee advisory group, the National Advisory Council of Employees with Dis disabilities (NACED), advises the agency regarding reasonable accommodations, recruiting, and creating pathways for promotions and retention. All three selected agencies reported to GAO that they provide training on Schedule A hiring authority to their hiring managers and human resources professionals. However, the agencies have found that some hiring managers are unfamiliar with or unsure of how to use the hiring authority, which allows federal agencies to hire qualified individuals without regard to disabilities. As a result, these agencies found that there is a continual need to increase managers' awareness of Schedule A and to educate both managers and personnel on the use of the authority. The agencies also reported that many reasonable accommodation provisions are low- to no cost to their agencies, often involving minor changes to an employee's workspace or work schedule, or modifications to work-related technologies, but did not assess the impact of their training related to Schedule A. Without evaluating the impacts of training to ensure that hiring managers understand how and when to use Schedule A, agencies may be missing opportunities to enhance awareness of and sensitivity to disability issues and opportunities to increase employment of people with disability across the federal workforce.
 BLM oversees private entities operating thousands of oil and gas wells on leased federal lands and has taken steps over the years to strengthen its management of the potential liability that these operations represent should operators not fully reclaim wells and return lands to their original condition when production ceases. GAO was asked to review BLM's management of wells. This report (1) describes the value of bonds for oil and natural gas wells in 2018 compared to 2008 and (2) examines the extent to which BLM's bonds ensure complete and timely reclamation and thus prevent orphaned wells. To do this work, GAO analyzed BLM data on bonds and reclamation costs, reviewed BLM's policies and regulations, and interviewed BLM officials. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) held bonds worth an average of $2,122 per well in 2018, a decrease of 3.9 percent as compared to the average bond value in 2008 (see table). BLM bonds do not typically cover an individual well, but GAO calculated the average on a per-well basis (bond amount divided by the number of wells covered by the bond) to compare the value over time adjusted for the increased number of well covered in 2018. The average value per well was slightly lower in 2018 than in 2008 because of the increase in the number and type of wells on federal land and because of changes in the composition of bonds. For example, as of 2018, an individual lease bond covered about 10 wells, a statewide bond covered 49 wells, and a nationwide bond covered 374 wells. In 2008, statewide bonds represented about 80 percent (approximately $130 million) of the total value of BLM bonds, while in 2018 it represented about 59 percent (about $120 million). Bonds do not provide sufficient financial assurance to prevent orphaning wells—wells whose bonds were not sufficient to pay for needed reclamation when operators or other parties failed to reclaim them. BLM does not have the authority to seek or collect fees from lease operators to reclaim orphaned well. However, in May 2018 GAO reported that 13 BLM field offices identified about $46.2 million in estimated potential reclamation cost associated with orphaned and inactive wells that BLM officials deemed to be at risk of becoming orphaned. In April 2019, BLM provided a list of 296 orphaned Wells that included 89 new wells that were not identified on the July 2017 list. In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) directs Interior to establish a program that, among other things, provides for the identification and recovery of costs from persons or other entities currently providing a bond or other financial assurance for an oil or gas well that is orphaned, abandoned, or idled. BLM may be able to obtain funds from operators to cover the costs of reclamation, consistent with EPAct 2005, through the imposition of user fees. BLM processes more than 3,500 applications to drill each year, on average, and has over 14,000 inactive wells. Based on GAO's calculations, a separate fee of about $1,300 charged at the time a drilling application is submitted (in addition to the current drilling application filing fee, which is $10,050), or an annual fee of less than $350 for inactive wells could generate enough revenue to cover, in a little over a decade, the entire $46 million in reclamation potential costs identified to GAO.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) inspects multifamily and public housing properties to ensure that they are decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair. In fiscal years 2013 through 2017, REAC conducted 44,486 inspections of multifamily properties and 15,156 inspections of public housing developments. GAO was asked to review REAC's inspection process. This report examines (1) HUD's process for identifying physical deficiencies, (2) REac's processes for selecting, training, and developing inspectors, (3) its processes for monitoring inspectors, and (4) its monitoring and enforcement processes for addressing physical deficiencies and how its information is used to support these processes. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed REAC inspection data and documents, interviewed REAC staff, and held discussion groups with REAC inspectors, property owners, and other stakeholders. The Department of HUD's ( HUD) Real estate assessment center (REac) has a standardized inspection process to identify physical deficiencies at HUD-assisted properties. REAC uses a handheld data collection device and software to identify and record deficiencies and assess the severity of the deficiencies identified. For example, if an inspector identifies a deficiency with a door in a dwelling unit, the software will ask the inspector to identify which door has the deficiency and the nature of the deficiency (e.g., the door does not work). The software then assigns a severity level to the deficiency, if it is severe enough, and requires the inspectors to take a photo. The software helps ensure consistency between inspectors and consistency with the inspection protocol, according to REAC officials. However, the inspection process has some weaknesses, such as inconsistent application of inspection protocols and standards, which may hinder its ability to identify deficiencies. HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing (multifamily housing) depends on REAC inspections to provide assessments of the physical condition of properties under its jurisdiction. MultIFamily Housing is required to direct property owners to correct physical deficiencies based on the REAC physical inspection score. For properties that score 60 or below on the inspection score, HUD's current practice is to issue a notice to owners to certify that deficiencies have been identified and corrected within 60 days of receiving the notice. For property owners who do not submit a certification or for properties that do not complete the certification or score 30 or below, HUD or the Department of Enforcement Center schedules a follow-up inspection to determine whether the owner corrected the deficiencies. The 2017 and 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Acts require HUD to issue notices to property owners when the score is 59 or below. HUD officials told GAO that they believe language in the appropriations acts is not clear regarding the threshold for issuing notices. Unless Congress changes the threshold identified in appropriations acts from 60 to 59 or HUD changes its practice, HUD actions will continue to be inconsistent with the legal requirement. The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) has identified some weaknesses in the inspection and quality assurance processes used by REAC, and GAO found that some contract inspectors are conducting inspections that are not as rigorous as those conducted using REAC standards. Federal internal control standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. Federal standards also call for remediating identified internal control deficiencies on a timely basis. As of November 2018, HUD had not yet implemented most of the recommendations from its Rapid Response and Resolution Team, which was created in 2016 to address problems with HUD's multifamily property inspection processes. HUD attributed the delay in implementing the recommendations to prior vacancies in some senior leadership positions, including positions in Multif Family Housing. HUD has made limited progress in implementing recommendations from the team's 2016 review of REAC.
Section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to report every 6 months after the date of enactment on December 23, 2016, through December 31, 2019, to the congressional defense committees on DOD's implementation of section 911. Section 911 requires the Secretary of Defense to take several actions, such as issuing an organizational strategy and establishing cross-functional teams, to promote a collaborative culture within the department. DOD's Office of the Chief Management Officer (OCMO) is responsible for developing and finalizing the department's organizational strategy. GAO was asked to review DOD's progress in implementing section 911 since its enactment. This report examines (1) the status of DOD's efforts to implement section 911, and (2) the extent to which DOD's cross- functional teams are working toward their mission. To do this work, GAO reviewed DOD's organizational strategies and cross- Functional Teams guidance and interviewed OCMO and team officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) has completed seven of the 10 statutory requirements required by section 911 in the NDAA for fiscal year 2017, but has not completed three remaining requirements. DOD has completed three additional statutory requirements since GAO's August 2019 report (see table below). GAO previously reported that DOD had completed four of the statutory requirements, specifically awarding a contract for a study to determine how to best implement cross-Functional Teams, providing the results of the study to Congress, establishing any cross-functional teams to address critical department objectives and outputs, and reporting to Congress on the establishment of the teams. DOD also completed the required assessments of the electronic warfare capabilities of the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China in consultation with the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in accordance with section 1053 of the John S. McCain National Defense authorization act for fiscal years 2019 and 2020, and is continuing to demonstrate leading practices for effective teams, similar to what GAO reported in August 2019. In October 2019, DOD approved its organizational strategy, which is expected to fully address all section 911 requirements and leading practices. However, while the approved organizational strategy cites the leading practices, it does not include specific implementation steps that explain how DOD will follow these practices. For example, consistent with the leading practice for establishing a coherent mission and integrated strategic goals to guide the transformation, the January 2019 draft of the organizational strategy proposed that the CMO develop an implementation plan with goals and milestones, communicate those goals, and report periodically on the achievement of the goals. In place of these specific steps, the approved strategy simply lists these leading practices and makes a broad statement that DOD is committed to further incorporating and institutionalizing these practices at every opportunity. In addition, DOD has not provided required training to presidential appointees and has not conducted the required analysis of the successes and failures of its crossfunctional teams. In February 2018, DOD issued a draft curriculum for training for the training of presidential appointee and staff members, but the curriculum has not been approved and DOD has contracted for the delivery of the required training for these appointees. DOD officials told GAO they now expect that training to be provided in 2020. DOD is continuing its work to develop requirements and specific plans to improve Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations capabilities across the department and to achieve operational superiority and has expanded the number of teams to include two existing task forces. The department has not yet identified responsibility for funding one of the cross-operational teams established under section 911 and, according to officials, has not identified funding for the team for future fiscal years. In August 2019, we reported that the team's progress was negatively affected by funding delays resulting from disagreements among senior leadership over the responsibility for Funding the Team. The disagreement had been resolved in fiscal year 2019, but had not yet been resolved for future years. We recommended, and DOD concurred, that DOD clarify roles and responsibilities for providing administrative support and funding for this team. DOD agreed with our recommendation and provided additional information on the steps it has taken or plans to take to advance a collaborative Culture. In December 2019, the Secretary approved DOD's two-page guidance on cross functional teams. We found that this guidance addresses most, but not all, of the 911 requirements. Specifically, it addresses in whole or in part six of the seven 911 requirements, including identifying critical objectives that would benefit from the use of teams and providing for the appropriate use of these teams.
Sanctions provide a range of tools that Congress and the President may use to seek to alter or deter the behavior of a foreign government, individual, or entity in furtherance of U.S. national security or foreign policy objectives. Sanctions may be used in response to human rights abuses, weapons proliferation, or occupation of a country; ultimately seeking to change the behaviors of those perpetrating these offenses. The Departments of the Treasury, State, and Commerce, as well as the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, have primary roles in implementing sanctions. GAO was asked to review the effectiveness of sanctions. In this report, GAO (1) describes how the roles of Treasury, Commerce, and State are identified; (2) examines the extent to which agencies assess sanctions' effectiveness; and (3) identifies factors that have been shown by publicly available studies to contribute to their effectiveness. To address these objectives GAO reviewed relevant laws, executive orders, and agency documents; conducted a literature review; and interviewed agency officials. Treasury, the Department of State (State), and Commerce reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Treasury's, State's, and Department of Commerce's roles for implementing sanctions are established either directly by the statute or executive order authorizing the sanctions or through an interagency process and agreement. For example, Treasury is often the lead for country-based sanctions, because these programs often focus on international financial transactions, while State usually serves as the lead on sanctions requiring more specialized knowledge, such as those relating to weapons of mass destruction and nuclear nonproliferation. Commerce implements sanctions by restricting licenses for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) involving U. S.-origin items-- commodities, software, and technology--subject to its jurisdiction and destined for sanctioned persons, entities, and destinations. Commerce also enforces export controls through its Office of Export Enforcement, which conducts criminal and administrative investigations of potential violations of export regulations. In addition, Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) restricts sanctioned countries' and persons' access to U.s. items through its export licensing process. Other agencies with roles in sanctions implementation include the Department of Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, and Justice. The agencies involved and the extent of their involvement depend largely on their area of expertise. The Department of Defense restricts arm sales and other forms of military cooperation and is involved in decisions regarding export licenses, while Energy assists in implementing non Proliferation sanctions and Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection helps assure that shipments to and from sanctioned countries and entities do not leave or enter the United States. The department of Justice investigates and prosecutes violations of sanctions and export laws and provides legal reviews of sanctions' designations. Commerce's Office of Foreign Assets Control enforces sanctions by conducting civil investigations of sanctions violators and working with law enforcement agencies. The three agencies assess potential and observed impacts of specific sanctions, but officials stated they do not conduct agency assessments of their effectiveness in achieving broader policy goals and cited various difficulties in doing so. These assessments often contribute to broader interagency discussions, typically coordinated through the National Security Council (NSC), that examine the effectivenessof sanctions in achieving policy goals. According to agency officials, an NSC-led process allows the government to draw upon multiple agencies' inputs and perspectives, and to consider these issues in the larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.N. policy goals, according to Treasury and State officials. Studies examining factors that contributed to the effectiveness or economic impact of sanctions in changing behavior found that sanctions have been more effective when they were implemented through an international organization (e.g., the United Nations) or when the target had some existing dependency on or relationship with theUnited States. However, these studies may not fully reflect certain types of sanctions, including targeted sanctions and secondary sanctions, which target third-party actors doing business with, supporting, or facilitating targeted regimes, persons, and organizations.
Medicare and Medicaid are two of the largest federal-state health care financing programs, accounting for more than $400 billion in outlays in fiscal year 2017, or about one-third of total federal health care spending. GAO was asked to review improper payments in Medicare and Medicaid FFS. This report examines (1) the extent to which the programs' improper payment estimates are based on insufficient documentation, (2) how the programs obtain and review documentation, and (3) how differences in documentation requirements may affect improper payment rates and assessments of program risks. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documentation requirements for Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs and interviewed CMS officials and Medicaid officials in six states selected based on variation in program size, complexity, and geographic location. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), estimates improper payments for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) and Medicaid for certain services at high risk for improper payments, such as home health, durable medical equipment (DME), laboratory services, and home oxygen supplies. CMS's contractors randomly sample and manually review medical record documentation associated with FFS claims for payment from providers, also known as medical reviews, to estimate improper payment amounts and rates for the programs nationally for a given fiscal year. These reviews are conducted to determine whether claims were paid or denied properly in accordance with program coverage policies, including coverage policies based on statutes, regulations, other CMS coverage rules, and each state's coverage policies in the case of Medicaid. The Medicare FFS improper payment estimate is based on medical reviews conducted on about 50,000 Medicare claims in 2017. For Medicaid, the Medicaid improper payment measurement contractor conducted medical reviews on nearly 31,000 Medicaid claims across fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017 to estimate fiscal year2017 improper payments. CMS officials told GAO that the contractor's medical reviews do not generate statistically generalizable information about improper payments by service type and, as a result, they do not provide robust state-specific information on the corrective actions needed to address the underlying causes of improper payments because the number of Medicaid improper payments identified through medical reviews is too small to generate robust results. For example, the contractor identified 918 improper payments nationwide out of nearly 31000 claims subjected to medical reviews in fiscal years 2017 and 2016. CMS requires state Medicaid agencies to develop corrective actions to rectify each improper payment identified through the medical reviews. However, since the Medicaid review sample in a state typically is not large enough to be statistically generalizable by servicetype, the identified improper payments may not be representative of the prevalence of improperpayments associated with different services within the state. Federal internal control standards require agencies to identify and analyze program risks so they can effectively respond to such risks, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) expects agencies to implement corrective actions that address underlying causes. Without estimates that provide data on the most prevalent underlying causes, particularly by service types, a state Medicaid agency may not have the information it needs to develop appropriate corrective actions or prioritize activities to effectively address program risks, which could result in a lack of information needed to develop effective strategies to protect the integrity of the programs. Differences in Medicare's and Medicaid's documentation requirements likely contributed to the substantial variation in improper payment rate estimates for the services GAO examined, which raises questions about how well these programs' documentation requirements help in determining whether services comply with coverage policies and accordingly help identify causes of program risk. For Medicare, improper payments stemming from insufficient documentation increased substantially starting in 2009, while insufficient documentation in Medicaid has remained relatively stable since 2011. CMS has attributed the increase in Medicare insufficient documentation since 2009 in part to changes made in the criteria for Medicare medical review review criteria. In addition, more recent policy changes that added to Medicare documentation requirements in 2015 and 2016 may have also contributed to an increase in insufficient documentation. Without a better understanding of how documentation requirements affect improper payments estimates, CMS may have difficulty identifying and analyzing program risks and developing strategies to reduce improper payments and protect program integrity.
In 2015, DHS established a priority enforcement program (PEP) to prioritize the apprehension, detention, and removal of potentially removable aliens who pose a threat to national security, border security, and public safety. In 2017, DHS issued a memo to implement Executive Order 13768, which focuses on immigration enforcement within the United States and calls for the termination of the PEP and reinstitution of Secure Communities. GAO was asked to review ICE's enforcement of immigration laws. This report examines, among other things, (1) ICE arrests, detentions, and removals from calendar years 2015 through 2018; (2) changes ICE made to align its policies with the 2017 DHS memo; and (3) the extent to which ICE collects data on selected populations in detention and what these data show. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed ICE arrest and detention data for calendar years 2016 through 2018, reviewed ICE policies, and interviewed ICE officials and nongovernmental organizations that serve or represent immigrants in six selected areas of responsibility. The number of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) administrative arrests (arrests) of aliens without criminal convictions known to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as “non-criminals” increased by more than 30 percent overall from 2015 to 2018, while the number of arrests of convicted criminals remained relatively stable during this period. Detentions of non-criminal aliens also increased overall, from more than 324,000 in 2015 to more than 438,200 in 2018. The majority of detentments resulted from CBP arrests at or between ports of entry. Removals of convicted criminal aliens accounted for the majority of ERO remOVals each year, ranging from 58 to 63 percent of the total removal of males, and for the minority of removALS of females each year. According to ICE officials, in early 2018, ERO conducted a review of all existing policies and related documents to help ensure alignment with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo, resulting in operational policies related to six of the eight selected populations discussed in this report. The six policies are in effect as of July 2019 for the selected populations and provide direction and guidance to ERO officers on the identification, care, and Removal of certain aliens who are: individuals with mental disorders, transgender individuals with disabilities, parents of minors, pregnant women, and individuals who are elderly, among others. Of the six policies in effect, three are related to the removal of pregnant and mentally ill individuals, and two are for individuals with criminal convictions. ICE data show that detentons of most of the selected population in GAO's review varied between calendar years 2017 and 2018. For example, the total number of transgender individuals detained increased overall from 2016 to 2018. However, we were unable to obtain data on parents or legal guardians of minors in ICE custody because ICE does not collect or maintain data on this population in a readily available format. ICE policy requires ICE personnel to enter information into its data system once a detained alien has been determined to be a parent or legal guardian of a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident minor, but this information cannot be readily searched to identify all detained parents or guardians in custody. Therefore, ICE cannot evaluate and share this information and ensure its officers are collecting information on this populations in accordance with its policy. Implementing a process to collect and maintain this information would allow ICE to better assess the impacts of its enforcement actions on these populations and help improve ICE oversight efforts.
In 2016, Congress amended TSCA, which authorizes EPA to evaluate and, if appropriate, regulate existing chemicals and new chemicals. EPA's IRIS Program is responsible for preparing chemical risk assessments that provide the foundation for EPA's risk management decisions, such as whether to establish air and water quality standards to protect the public from exposure to toxic chemicals. GAO was asked to review EPA's efforts to implement the law. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which EPA has made progress in (1) addressing identified process challenges, (2) responding to statutory deadlines, and (3) ensuring that it has the appropriate resources to carry out its responsibilities under T SCA. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed EPA documents and interviewed EPA officials and representatives from industry, environmental, and other stakeholders. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program has addressed many process challenges by making changes to address the length of time it takes to develop chemical assessments and to increase transparency, but EPA has not made progress toward producing chemical assessments. For example, in 2017, the program began tailoring assessments to meet program and regional office needs, called fit-for-purpose assessments, which are more limited in scope and targeted to specific needs, reducing the amount of time IRIS staff needed to search for information, synthesize it, and draft, review, and issue an assessment. However, EPA leadership delayed the release of documents related to IRIS assessments for nearly 6 months because EPA leadership instructed the program not to release any assessment documentation pending the outcome of EPA leadership deliberations concerning IRIS program priorities. As a result, any assessment or subsidiary assessment document (e.g., an IRIS Assessment Plan or protocol) that was ready for agency review, public comment, or peer review was unable to proceed through the IRIS assessment development process. EPA has demonstrated progress implementing the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) by responding to its statutory deadlines through the end of fiscal year 2018, including promulgating rules, developing guidance, and releasing reports, but key challenges remain. Specifically, EPA has responded to the statutory deadlines to promulgate new rules, develop guidance to ensure consistency, and ensure that the new chemicals review process is efficient and predictable, but faces challenges such as managing the risks posed by ongoing litigation, ensuring appropriate resources, and ensuring that guidance is consistent with the new process. In addition, three of the four Framework Rules that EPA issued to implement TSC a have been challenged in court. EPA must finalize 10 ongoing risk evaluations by December 2019, which represents a tight deadline, according to EPA officials, and must ensure that 20 risk evaluations are ongoing for high-priority substances 3-1/2 years after enactment and that at least 20 chemical substances have been designated as low- priority substances. EPA also faces challenges ensuring it has appropriate resources and ensuring consistency in developing guidance for its risk evaluations. EPA did not have deadlines for completing existing chemical evaluations prior to the enactment of the Lautenberg Act, but the law requires EPA to complete its first 10 existing risk evaluations not later than 3 years after the date on which it initiated the risk evaluations, which was December 2016. The law also allows for an extension of the risk evaluation deadlines for up to 6 months if the agency deems it necessary. EPA is also required to make a determination on a new chemical before it can be manufactured—another source of increased workload. EPA officials told GAO that they have concerns about staff capacity within OPPT, which manages risk assessment and risk management for new and existing chemicals, and are taking steps to improve capacity by implementing a planned reorganization and hiring new staff. In commenting on a draft of this report, EPA stated that the concerns raised by staff are likely common to any program undergoing change. EPA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made significant changes to the U.S. tax code, including business and international provisions. TCJA requires IRS to issue regulations to implement these provisions. GAO was asked to review IRS's implementation of TCJA. This report (1) examines IRS's processes that it has in place to provide guidance to taxpayers on TCJA provisions; (2) assesses the economic analyses Treasury conducted as part of the regulatory development process; (3) evaluates IRS monitoring of implementation of these provisions and describes implementation status; and (4) examines any challenges that could affect IRS's ability to effectively administer the provisions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed IRS documentation, interviewed IRS officials, and interviewed tax practitioners. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made considerable progress in implementing the Business and International provisions of the Tax C cuts and jobs act of 2017. For example, as of the end of fiscal year 2019, IRS had issued approximately half of its planned official guidance for the 86 business provisions. IRS also issued 13 of 19 planned proposed regulations and 3 of 18 planned final regulations for the qualified business income deduction and repatriation tax provisions. However, IRS missed internal target dates for issuing 10 guidance documents initially targeted for publication, including three final regulations. According to IRS, several factors affected its ability to issue guidance within planned time frames, including ambitious project planning and a partial lapse in appropriations from December 22, 2018, through January 25, 2019, which reduced available resources for implementation tasks. Further, Treasury's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) began subjecting more tax regulations to further review as agreed to in a Memorandum of Agreement between Treasury and OMB in April 2018. As a result of this review, OMB took an average of about 38 calendar days to review 25 TCJA regulations from July 2018 to September 30, 2019. IRS has not determined publication dates for the remaining 14 regulations. IRS completed all TCJA tasks that it agreed to complete prior to the opening of the 2019 filing season, including updates to electronic forms and the underlying technology IRS uses to receive returns. IRS officials said that they completed these tasks by prioritizing TCJA work over other tasks and modifying its routine processes for implementing IT changes. As of October 2018, IRS's Information Technology organization had identified an additional 124 TCJA-related tasks for the 2020 filing season. Officials expected to complete tasks prior to this filing season to IRS documentation and officials, such as updating underlying IT systems that can be more used for compliance purposes, updating critical IT systems, and implementing error resolution codes to correct some mistakes on submitted returns. The lack of final regulations creates uncertainty for taxpayers and enforcement challenges for IRS. Treasury did not issue all planned regulations within the 18 months the agency generally has to issue final regulations retroactive to the date of the law's enactment or before taxpayers were required to file tax returns, which has the potential to be significant for both taxpayers and IRS. Specifically, Treasury issued five of the 51 final regulations it had planned to issue to implement TCJA business provisions within this time frame. Treasury also issued one temporary regulation for one provision that was not retroactively effective. In the absence of regulations, taxpayers must rely on the statutory language to understand the law. Taxpayers and tax practitioners GAO interviewed cited several provisions in need of additional guidance and identified challenges associated with those provisions that have the potential for affecting taxpayers' ability to comply with the law, including confusion regarding and challenges related to the definitions of “related party” and “interest” in the limitation on the deduction for interest and difficulty for individuals and corporations to understand and comply with international changes given interdependence of several of the international provisions, among other things. IRS may also face additional challenges administering the law in instances where Treasury has yet to issue proposed regulations. Treasury has not issued 27 proposed regulations for business or international provisions for which it has not yet issued final regulations, and generally final regulations would not be effective until 2020. Treasury and IRS made decisions that could potentially affect tax liability by billions of dollars per year, which would have distributional effects on the economy, but these effects were not included in Treasury's regulatory analyses. Treasury's internal guidance for conducting regulatory impact analyses is inconsistent with the standards for internal control in the federal government and guidance from OMB, which requires agencies to analyze the distributional consequences of regulations. By not including these effects in its analyses, Treasury risks making regulatory decisions
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) establishes a legal right of access to government information on the basis of the principles of openness and accountability in government. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the nation's largest federal agency in terms of the number of requests it receives for information, and its FOIA backlog is the largest of any federal agency. In June 2018, GAO reported that DHS had a backlog ranging from 28,553 in fiscal year 2012 to 53,971 in 2018. GAO was asked to testify on DHS's FOIA operations. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which DHS has implemented key FOIA requirements to help improve the processing of FOIA requests, (2) the number and complexity of DHS's efforts to reduce backlogs, and (3) duplication in certain components' processing of immigration files. This statement is based on GAO's prior work issued from fiscal years 2012 through 2018 on DHS FOIA operations and updates on fragmentation, overlap, and duplication issued in 2015 through 2019. To conduct this work, we reviewed agency documents and interviewed DHS officials. In a June 2018 report, we found that DHS implemented six key requirements to improve its FOIA operations, including updating response letters, implementing tracking systems, providing FOIA training, providing records online, and designating chief FOIA officers. For example, DHS updated its FOIA response letters to include certain information, such as if part of a request is denied. In addition, DHS used commercial automated systems to track the status of requests and had established telephone or internet services to assist requesters in tracking a request's status. DHS also developed a mobile application that allowed FOIA requesters to submit a request and check its status. The department's FOIA tracking systems were compliant with requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (as amended), which required federal agencies to make their electronic information accessible to people with disabilities. DHS' chief FOIA officer offered FOIA training opportunities to staff in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, as required by the 2016 FOIA amendments, and provided training in responding to, handling, and processing FOIA requests. Duplication exists when two or more agencies or programs are engaged in the same activities or provide the same services to the same beneficiaries. Specifically, in 2014, we reported that within DHS, three components—U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)—created most of the documents included in immigration files, which usually contain various types of information pertaining to immigrants, including asylum applications, law enforcement records, and border crossing documents. USCIS and ICE had an agreement whereby USCIS processed ICE's documents contained in an immigration file. However, since that agreement ended, the components had not made plans to enter into another such agreement. We noted that, while there would be costs associated with USCIS processing ICE's files, the potential existed for additional costs to be incurred in the continued duplicate processing of such files. In response, we recommended in November 2014 that DHS determine the viability of re-establishing the service-level agreement to eliminate duplication. In August 2018, DHS's Privacy Office Director of Correspondence/Executive Secretary stated that the Privacy Office was leading a working group in collaboration with the Office of the Chief Information Officer to develop requirements for a single information technology solution for processing incoming FOIA requests that would result in processing benefits and lower overall administrative costs. We continue to track DHS's progress in implementing this recommendation. As of October 2019, DHS stated that these actions were still in progress.
The Department of Defense (DOD) uses military and commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) to meet its global communications requirements. DOD's primary wideband SATCOM system, the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites, currently provides a portion of DOD's required SATCOM bandwidth, but the Air Force estimates its satellite constellation's capabilities will begin to degrade in the late 2020s. The Air Force is adding at least one more satellite to the WGS constellation and plans for an enhanced WGS-11 to provide the capacity of two satellites. In addition, DOD is considering the potential for adding a 12th WGS satellite. GAO was asked to review DOD's process for selecting a post-WGS SATCOM architecture. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD conducted a comprehensive analysis of alternatives (AOA) to inform future SATCOM decisions and (2) how DOD obtained and incorporated stakeholder input into the AOA. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD's AOA and related documentation and interviewed DOD officials. DOD completed its analysis of widebandSatCOM alternatives in June 2018 and identified 11 alternatives that represent several possible approaches to SATCOM acquisitions. GA O found the Wide Band SATCOM AOA to be a comprehensive assessment. The Wideband AOA study team developed 11 alternatives, which broadly represented three different acquisition approaches: legacy DOD SATCOM procurement focused on purpose-built systems with some commercially-contracted services; commercial-focused SATCOM acquisition; and a strategy that would transition from a mainly purpose- built system to a more commercial SATCOM-oriented model. The study team also examined the ground segment systems--including user terminals--which will communicate with the satellite system DOD chooses to replace WGS. Although user terminals were not the primary focus of this AOA, DOD officials told GAO this effort was the first time DOD has studied and consolidated department-wide costs for these terminals, which they said provided valuable context to decision-makers. DOD used multiple methods to obtain stakeholder and operational input to inform the WideBand AOA Study Plan, including eight working groups to consolidate subject matter experts for relevant SATCOM topics and interrelated Air Force and Defense Information Systems Agency studies that provided additional information on SATCOM business arrangements, user terminal prototyping, and acquisition efficiencies. DOD also solicited and incorporated information from other DOD stakeholders, such as the military services, operational users, and SATCOM partner nations, to inform its alternatives. DOD concluded that future wideband communications require a hybrid approach and more knowledge, but it does not have a plan to implement the Wide band AOA recommendations. The AOA found that integrating a new constellation of purpose-build satellites and commercially-provided systems into a hybrid architecture would save costs and provide more capability than any single system alone. DOD considered 11 potential architectures in its final analysis and all were to some extent hybrids of purpose built and commercial systems because DOD found that it requires a combination of military and private sector system capabilities. However, DOD has not historically managed these systems in coordination, or with an enterprise approach. DOD recommended actions to obtain more information and reduce risk by transitioning to an integrated architecture of purpose Built and Commercial Systems and reducing risk, but DOD lacks a plan for implementing these recommendations. For example, DOD's recommendation to develop an enterprise SATCOM terminal strategy is aimed at reducing the risk user terminals present to DOD's post WGS SATCom architecture. Without such a strategy, it is unclear what organization within DOD would begin working with the services to develop this strategy and potentially adjust the services' acquisition approach to terminals.
DOD's travel pay program is comprised of payments made by the department to active, reserve, and National Guard service members and civilian employees for temporary and permanent travel expenses. In fiscal year 2016, DOD spent about $6 billion on travel payments for personnel to travel in support of its mission, including about $9.5 billion for active duty servicemembers and about $5.3 billion for DOD civilian employees, according to DOD data. DOD's travel program is susceptible to significant improper payments because of its large volume of transactions and high dollar amount. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to reduce improper travel payments. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has taken steps to implement its Remediation Plan and (2) DOD's mechanisms to identify and address the errors that most frequently lead to improper payments and the cost-effectiveness of addressing those errors. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and met with officials to discuss DOD's implementation of its plan and conducted a web-based survey of DOD components. The results of the survey are not generalizable to all DOD components, but provide insight into component views. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken some positive steps to address its improper travel payment problems, but its approach may not adequately address the root causes of those problems. In October 2016, the department established a Remediated Plan aimed at reducing improper payments that includes specific requirements for all components as well as a committee to monitor the efforts of 10 components that DOD identified as key to addressing these problems. However, DOD did not consider available data on improper payment rates in its selection of these 10 components to include on the committee. As a result, DOD lacks assurance that the components it selected for greater scrutiny were the ones most at risk for improper payments. Further, the 10 components GAO surveyed did not fully implement the plan's requirements because DOD had not established milestones for completing all of the requirements, monitored whether the components had completed them on time, or held them accountable for completing the requirements. As of March 2019, only 4 of the 9 DOD components that responded to GAO's survey had completed all of these requirements. For instance, 1 component (the Defense Information Systems Agency) had not developed a component-level remediation plan, and 6 of the 10 DOD components (the U.S. Special Operations Command, the Defense Logistics Agency, the Missile Defense Agency, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency) have not developed corrective action plans to address the improper payments they identified, as required by the plan. In addition, while DOD established a mechanism to monitor whether components had implemented the remediation Plan requirements through the committee, this mechanism was not effective in holding components accountable for doing so. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should evaluate performance and hold individuals accountable for their internal control responsibilities. By establishing milestones, monitoring progress, and holding component leadership accountable for the implementation of the Plan's requirements, DOD would have greater assurance that it has taken sufficient actions to reduce its overall improper payment rate. DOD has implemented mechanisms to address errors leading to improper travel Payments, but these efforts do not clearly identify the root cause of these errors or the cost of addressing them. For example, DOD's Financial Management Regulation states that root causes must be identified and corrective plans developed and monitored on a regular basis to ensure that future improper payments will be reduced and eliminated. While DOD has established some mechanisms to try to help components identify root causes, our survey demonstrates that many travel management officials at DOD components do not understand the meaning of root cause. Until DOD defines the term “root cause” to ensure a common understanding of the term across the department, it will likely miss opportunities to make changes that could help address the underlying causes of improper travelpayments. DOD components also lack guidance to assist them in determining whether actions that would address root causes are cost-effective to implement.
The U.S. Coast Guard's shore infrastructure, which includes more than 20,000 buildings and structures, is critical to the agency's ability to carry out its mission of search and rescue, maritime security, and other missions. The Coast Guard has a backlog of at least $2.6 billion in deferred maintenance and construction projects, including $1.774 billion for recapitalization and new construction, as well as $900 million for depot-level maintenance. GAO was asked to provide information on Coast Guard shore infrastructure management. This testimony addresses the extent to which the Coast Guard (1) has taken actions to begin to improve its management of its shore infrastructure and (2) has applied leading practices and key risk management steps in managing its shore Infrastructure. This statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from October 2017 through February 2019. For those reports, GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents and interviewed Coast Guard officials. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Coast Guard—a component of the Department of Defense (DOD)—has taken a number of steps to improve the management of shore infrastructure. For example, in February 2019 GAO found that the Coast Coast Guard had a process to identify, document, and report risks to shore infrastructure in its annual shore infrastructure reports for fiscal years 2015 through 2018. These reports identified the types of risks the agency faces in not investing in its facilities, including financial risk, capability risk, and operational readiness risk. In addition, since at least 2012, the agency had documented its process to classify all of its real property under a tier system and established minimum investment targets by tier as part of its central depot level maintenance expenditure decisions. These tiers—which range from mission-critical to mission-supportive assets—were incorporated into guidance that Coast Guard decision makers are to follow in their deliberations about project funding, and to help them determine how to target funding more effectively. In February 2019, GA O found that almost half of the Coast Service's Shore Infrastructure is beyond its service life, and project backlogs will cost at least$2.5 billion to address as of 2018. The agency has taken some steps to address some of these backlogs, such as conducting a vulnerability assessment of its facilities to determine their vulnerability to natural disasters, but has not fully implemented the five steps in DHS's Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Framework to help it make cost effective risk management decisions. In September 2019, in response to GAO's recommendation that the agency implement risk management processes that more fully align with the five key steps outlined in the DHS Critical Infrastructure risk management framework, the Coast guard agreed with the recommendation and stated that it plans to make progress towards implementing the recommendation while developing and implementing its Component Resilience Plan, in accordance with the recently mandated DHS Resilient Framework. The federal government has taken a variety of actions to improve shore infrastructure; however, as GAO has previously reported, it has not yet fully applied key risks management practices and leading practices in its management efforts. Specifically, the agencies have not fully employed models for predicting the outcome of investments, analyzing tradeoffs, and optimizing decisions among competing investments, which could potentially identify and achieve cost savings across other shore infrastructure asset lines. In October 2017, in an effort to reduce duplication in its boat and air station coverage, and better position it to address shore infrastructure challenges, the federal government agreed to a GAO recommendation to close duplicative boat stations and disposing of unneeded assets. As of September 2019 the agency has not closed any stations, but it is considering changes to the operational status of several stations, including closing them during the winter months when they conduct few, if any, search and Rescue cases. In January 2019, the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported that some of the 18 boat stations recommended for closure had projects listed on a Coast Guard project backlog, and GAO will continue to monitor its actions to address this recommendation.
Federal retirement programs have relied on a subpopulation price index to adjust benefits since automatic cost-of-living adjustments were first enacted almost 45 years ago. This index estimates changes in purchasing power for wage earners as opposed to changes in the standard of living or some other type of measurement. In recent years, numerous legislative proposals have been suggested to change this index from one that measures the purchasing power of wage earners to one that targets some different population, for example one solely focused on the elderly. Much of the debate over using a different index has centered on the ability (i.e., the accuracy) of the indexes to capture changes in cost of living for a particular group in society. The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is unsure whether the data sources it currently uses are adequate to produce accurate CPI-E and CPI-W subpopulation indexes on a timely basis, according to BLS officials and documentation. BLS has not evaluated the adequacy of existing data because it is costly to undertake a full evaluation, but there may be cost-efficient ways to do so. In addition, BLS relies on the Consumer Expenditure Survey to produce expenditure weights that measure the mix of goods and services consumers purchase and, because of survey shortcomings and processing lags, the weights reflect spending patterns that can be up to 4 years out of date. While BLS is exploring alternative data sources, it has not fully explored the potential to update expenditure weights on a more frequent basis using annual data from the National Accounts, which are currently collected in part to measure Gross Domestic Product. While not specifically designed for use in CPIs, these data may provide BLS an opportunity to supplement Consumer Expenditures Survey data in the intervening years. Moreover, some literature GAO reviewed indicated that the use of National Accounts data has the Potential to mitigate measurement error in the Consumer expenditure survey, thereby increasing accuracy. Without adequately exploring the potential of such an option, the Bureau of Economic Analysis may be missing an opportunities to improve its CPIs. GAO's review of selected countries' national pension systems revealed that it is relatively uncommon to use a retiree-specific index for the purpose of adjusting national pension benefits. Of the 36 OECD countries, 27 have national pension programs in which indexation is based, at least in part, on prices after initial benefits have been set, similar to Social Security in the United States. Most OECD countries use their primary measures of inflation, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), to adjust pension benefits, and 10 of the 27 use an older subpopulation index. However, of these 10 countries, only four countries use the index for older Americans to adjust their national benefits (Australia, Czech Republic, Hungary, and the Slovak Republic). The others produce the sub Population Index for research or other purposes, but do not use it for pension benefit adjustments. Officials in all three of the three case study countries said they generally saw a value in having a primary index for macroeconomic purposes and a sub population index that could be used for other purposes such as indexation of benefits. While some of the stakeholders in selected countries indicated it could be theoretically possible to create a chained CPI for the older population, GAO did not identify any countries with such an index during this review.
In recent years, the United States has increasingly relied on sanctions as a means to achieve important foreign policy goals, such as preventing Iran and North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Treasury, State, and Commerce have units that focus primarily on sanctions implementation, and other agencies have roles in sanctions implementation in addition to other responsibilities. GAO was asked to review the implementation of U.S. sanctions. This report examines (1) agencies' roles in sanction implementation, (2) the resources available to these units, (3) the extent to which these units have assessed their resource needs, and (4) the agencies' reporting to Congress of sanctions implementation expenses and activities. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. The Departments of the Treasury (Treasury), State (State), and Commerce (Commerce), as well as other agencies, have units dedicated primarily to sanctions implementation and also have units with roles in implementation. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers and enforces economic sanctions based on foreign policy and national security, while Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) oversees export controls. Commerce's Foreign Policy Division (FPD) is responsible for developing, analyzing, evaluating, and coordinating export controls related to sanctions policy. The three units GAO examined—Treasury's OFAC, State's State Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation (SPI) and Commerce's FPD—have generally received steady or increasing resources since fiscal year 2015 but have faced challenges in filling some positions. OFAC has received increasing inflation-adjusted budgetary and authorized human resources each fiscal year since 2015 but has consistently experienced a gap between the number of authorized and actual full-time equivalents (FTEs). OFAC officials attributed the gap to challenges in hiring due to competition from other agencies and the private sector and the time needed for new hires to obtain security clearances. State SPI has also generally received additional authorized budgetary and human resources but has not been fully staffed in recent years. Commerce has received relatively steady budgetary resources but, according to Commerce officials, lacks funding to fill one of its 10 positions. Agencies assess resource needs through the annual budget process and have begun workforce planning, but all three agencies face challenges in determining needs. Treasury OFAC reviews and requests resources as part of its annual budget development process and has begun an internal workforce planning process that, if implemented as described, would satisfy principles for strategic workforce planning that GAO has previously identified. According to State SPI officials, SPI assesses its resources and has been able to add temporary positions in response to workforce needs. Commerce BIS has previously prepared a budget strategy that included its office primarily responsible for sanctions implementation. All three agencies have information that can be used to measure changes in their sanctions workload over time; however, agency officials cited challenges in using this information as accurate measures of workload for the purpose of informing resource needs. For example, counting the numbers of individual actions taken to implement sanctions (e.g., designations, licenses, or the imposition of a penalty) does not capture the varying complexity or the time spent on developing potential actions that are ultimately not taken. Both OFAC and State each prepare and submit reports on sanctions activities and expenditures to Congress, but State's reports for Executive Order 12938 have not explained the information that State considered in reporting no expenditures. As a result, Congress does not have complete information about the data that State considers in calculating its sanctions implementation resources.
DHS is responsible for securing the nations borders, ports, waterways, and waterwayswhich are critical to securing the United States national security and economic well-being. In fiscal year 2018, DHSalong with other federal agenciesspent more than $50 billion to develop, acquire, operate, and maintain a broad range of critical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railroads, and ports. GAO was asked to review DHSS major acquisition programs. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which these programs are on track to meet current schedule and cost goals as of August 2019. To do this work, GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 27 programsselected based on cost, schedule, and performance goalswith a total life-cycle cost estimate of approximately $15.5 billion. These programs were selected based on a variety of factors, including program size, scope, and status of prior GAO reports on these programs. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)the federal agency within the Department of Justice that leads federal efforts to secure the borderhas a broad portfolio of major acquisitions, including those that are intended to provide critical capability to operators in support of the department’s missions. These include systems such as border security, transportation security, law enforcement, homeland security, and emergency response, among others. DHS has categorized its major acquisitions into three major categories: (1) acquisition programs with life cycle cost estimates of $1 billion or more, (2) programs with cost estimates between $300 million and $1.1 billion, and (3) programs within each of the three levels of the acquisition life cyclethat is, those with a minimum life- cycle cost of $500 million or more. The programs in this review were categorized as follows: Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DHS and USCIS have not yet responded to GAOnor has DHS leadership reviewed this reportbut have provided technical comments on a draft, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Of the 27 programs GAO assessed, 25 are onTrack to Meet Current Schedule and Cost Goals, with Two Programs Breaching Goals Since January 2018. Of these 25 programs, 11 had revised their schedule or cost goals in response to a prior breach of their baseline or to incorporate program changes. This shows improvement from a prior review where seven programs were in breach. In addition, some programs, although currently on track, are nonetheless facing risks of breaching their goals, or have plans to revise their baseline in the future. As a result of the fiscal year 2019 partial government shutdown, five programs received approval for schedule adjustments, and other programs reported difficulty obligating funds. Seven programs are projected to experience an acquisition funding gap in fiscal year 2020, but, according to program officials, these gaps will be mitigated. Two programs that were early in the acquisition process and planned to establish department-approved goals were delayed in getting department approval for their initial baselines for various reasons; therefore, we excluded them from our assessment of whether programs were on track. We plan to assess these programs in future reviews.
In 2010, the FBI began incrementally replacing its fingerprint analysis system with Next Generation Identification (NGI) to provide new functionality and improve existing capabilities by incorporating advancements in biometrics, such as face recognition technology. As part of the fourth of six NGI increments, NGI-IPS updated the Interstate Photo System to provide a face recognition service that allows law enforcement agencies to search a database of criminal photos that accompany fingerprint submissions using a photo of an unknown person—called a probe photo. GAO was asked to review the FBI's use of face recognition. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which the FBI has ensured the accuracy of its face recognition capabilities and (2) the steps DOJ and the FBI have taken since May 2016 to better ensure privacy but work remains to fully address prior recommendations. This statement is based on GAO's May 2016 report ( GAO-16-619 ) and selected updates conducted in May 2019. For the selected updates, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed DOJ and FBI officials. In May 2016 GAO reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has taken limited actions to address GAO recommendations for ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of its new face recognition system. Specifically, in May 2016, we reported that prior to accepting and deploying the National Geographic Information System for Investigations (NGi-IPS), the FBI conducted testing to evaluate how accurately face recognition searches returned matches to persons in the database. However, we found that the tests were limited because they did not include all possible candidate list sizes and did not specify how often incorrect matches were returned. According to the National Science and Technology Council and the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the time, the detection rate (how often the technology generates a match when the person is in a database) and the false positive rate ( how often the system incorrectly generates a matching match to a person in the databases) are both necessary to assess accuracy. The FBI's detection rate requirement stated that when a person exists in the system's database, the system shall return a match of this person at least 85 percent of the time—but the FBI only tested this requirement with a candidate list of 50 potential matches. In these tests, 86 percent of these matches were correctly returned. The accuracy of the searches when returning fewer than 50 matches is unknown, and thus the FBI is limited in understanding whether the results are accurate enough to meet users' needs. As a result, we recommended that the FBI conduct an operational review of the system, at least annually, that includes an assessment of its accuracy and take actions, as necessary, to improve the system. The Department of Justice (DOJ) concurred with this recommendation and has taken steps to seek input from its users. For example, FBI submitted a staff paper through the fall 2016 Advisory Policy Board Process to solicit feedback from users on whether the searches are meeting their needs, and input regarding search accuracy. DOJ also stated that it will be working to conduct annual operational testing to determine if the system is meeting user needs. However the proposed testing, while promising, will not occur in an operational environment, which is the setting in which enrolled photos, rather than a test database of photos, are used to conduct a search for investigative leads. DOJ has taken some steps to improve its privacy processes but has not fully implemented its revised process since GAO last reported on this issue in 2016. In that report, we noted that DOJ did not publish a privacy impact assessment (PIA) for the FBIs face recognition capability in a timely manner and recommended that DOJ assess the PIA development process to determine why PIAs were not published prior to using or updating face recognition systems. In November 2018, DOJ officials told GAO that they had reviewed the process and determined that one reason the FBI did not complete PIAs more quickly was because the FBI and DOJ engaged in an extensive PIA revision process. In response, DOJ reported that it implemented a pilot in 2018 to expedite the approval process, which included developing a PIA approval template, conducting DOJ's review earlier in the process, and focusing the review solely on legal sufficiency instead of a more comprehensive review that included less significant editorial changes. DOJ officials reported that this new process has significantly reduced the time required between the completion of the Pia process by the FBI, and the review by DOJ. Further, DOJ has applied the same process to other DOJ components since December 2018, and that the pilot is
The FHLBank System comprises 11 federally chartered banks. FHLBanks are cooperatively owned by their members, such as commercial and community banks, thrifts, credit unions, and insurance companies. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) oversees the banks. In 2010, FHFA issued the Minority and Women Inclusion rule to set forth minimum requirements for FHL bank diversity programs and reporting. GAO was asked to review FHLbank board diversity. This report examines the (1) extent to which the agency has taken steps to encourage board diversity, (2) trends in diversity composition (gender, race, and ethnicity) for the boards of individual banks, and (3) challenges FHL banks face and practices they use to recruit and maintain a diverse board. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and bank documents; analyzed gender and race/ethnicity data from the banks' 2017 annual reports; and interviewed staff at FH FA and the 11 banks. Since 2015, the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBank) have taken a number of steps to increase board diversity at their member institutions. For example, in 2015, in response to a requirement in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, the banks established a Bank Presidents Conference Board Diversity Task Force to develop recommendations for advancing board diversity and to enhance collaboration and information sharing across boards. The task force developed a list of practices and strategies that can be generally summarized into three categories—emphasizing the importance of diversity, assessing skills diversity, and seeking new ways to find candidates—which are generally similar to the commonly cited practices for improving board diversity that GAO identified in 2015. In addition, in 2016, the FHL Banks established a system-wide board diversity task force, which includes representatives from all 11 banks and a bank president. In 2017, the task force reported that the number of minority directors on the board increased from 2015 to 2017, but the size of the increase is unclear because some directors did not self-identify their race/ ethnicity. Board directors voluntarily submit demographic information, including race/ ethnicity, and some directors might have chosen not to self- identify their race or ethnicity. The 11 FHL Bank boards have taken several steps to improve board diversity by, for example, holding diversity training for board directors and encouraging member institutions to increase diversity. However, the boards report some ongoing challenges that may slow or limit their efforts, including low levels of diversity in the financial sector, member institutions not prioritizing diversity, balancing the need for diversity with retaining institutional knowledge, and competition for women and minority candidates. In October 2018, the share of female board directors increased from 18 percent (34 directors) in 2015 to 23 percent (44 directors) (see figure). This represented a continuation of an upward trend since 2014, when GAO reported a 16 percent share (31 female directors) of female directors in 2014. Each bank had at least two female directors, but some boards had higher shares of women than others. Four banks—Chicago, Des Moines, Dallas, and Pittsburgh—had four or more female directors (representing 22-38 percent of the boards in October 2018). In comparison, seven banks had two or three female directors. The share of women who chaired board committees was the same as the total number of women on the overall FHL banking boards in 2018—23 percent. The number of directors who self-identified as racial/ethnic minorities increased from 10 percent in 2014 (19 directors) to 15 percent in 2017 (30 directors), but the data are incomplete. Eleven percent (20 directors) and 15 percent of board directors self- identified as racial-ethnic minorities in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Four percent (7 directors) did not identify race/ Ethnicity in 2015 or 2017, and 8 percent (15 directors) chose not to do so. Board demographic data collection processes vary by bank, which may contribute to the differences in data gaps. All 11 banks had a minority director on their boards in 2017. The banks varied in the data collection forms they used, questions they asked, and methods they used to distribute forms to board directors to obtain self-reported gender andRace/Ethnicity information. Although some banks had similar approaches to data collection, it is unclear whether certain approaches helped some banks to obtain more complete data despite directors' right to opt out of self-reporting demographic information. By obtaining a better understanding of the different processes FHL
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) collects tobacco user fees from tobacco manufacturers and importers to fund its tobacco regulation activities, including activities aimed at preventing youth use of tobacco products, educating the public about tobacco products and the risks associated with their use, and issuing regulations on the marketing and advertising of tobacco product. FDA collected about $4.5 billion in tobaccouser fees from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2018, according to FDA budget documents, and has ongoing authority to assess and collect $712 million annually starting in fiscal year 2019. GAO was asked to review FDA's process for calculating, billing, and collecting tobacco user fee payments. This report examines (1) the extent to which FDA has a process to calculate, bill, and collect tobacco user Fees and (2) the steps FDA has taken to ensure the accuracy and completeness of its user fee calculations, bills, and collections each fiscal year. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed FDA regulations and procedures, interviewed FDA officials, reviewed tobacco industry data, and interviewed officials from TTB and CBP, and reviewed documents related to FDA's processes for calculating and collecting user fees. FDA's Office of Financial Management, Division of User Fees and Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) within HHS's Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Safety and Research (Food Safety and Cosmetic Administration) has developed a process for assessing and collecting Tobacco User Fees, but has not completed a key activity to ensure completeness and accuracy. FDA relies on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's (TTB) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) annual tobacco excise tax data to calculate individual tobacco product user fees for each tobacco product class. However, FDA has been unable to complete the reconciliation process for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 because it identified problems with the quality of data it had initially received from these agencies. As of July 2019, FDA officials have received revised excise tax and volume data from CBP and TTB, and have requested, but have not yet received, revised 2018 data from both agencies. FDA officials stated that the agency has worked with both agencies to determine the reasons for the data problems, and officials believe they have determined that changes in both agencies' internal data systems affected the data fields that FDA needs to complete its reconciliation process. As a result, FDA plans to update its internal data system to accommodate a new CBP data format and then run the data through the updated system before completing the annual reconciliation process, which is designed to ensure complete and accurate data are used in calculating individual tobacco manufacturer and importer market share and user fee assessments. FDA has also designed procedures to ensure quarterly user fee invoices are billed to tobacco manufacturers in a timely manner and that payments are collected in a similar manner. For example, FDA's procedures provide for the calculation of quarterly user fees to be calculated automatically in FDA's Tobacco Billing Portal and for the collection of user fees when tobacco manufacturers or importers do not pay by the due date (i.e., the last day of the applicable fiscal year quarter). According to FDA, the agency does not have procedures or time frames for obtaining the quality data it needs from these two agencies for future years. Federal internal control standards call for agencies to use quality information to achieve their objectives. As part of this standard, agencies obtain relevant data from reliable sources and process these data into quality information that supports their internal control system. Without completing the year-end reconciliation process in a timeliness manner, FDA cannot ensure that the data it uses to calculate its individual user fees are complete, accurate, and timely. Consulting with these agencies, determining procedures and timeframes for FDA to receive the quality information it needs, and documenting them in a written agreement would help to address this risk.
Air ambulance providers respond to emergencies without knowing patients' health insurance coverage, such as whether the patient has private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or no insurance. For privately-insured patients, this means they cannot necessarily choose to be transported by air ambulance providers in their insurers' network and can potentially receive a balance bill from the providers for the difference between the price charged by the provider and the amount paid by the insurer. This amount is in addition to copayments, deductibles, or other types of cost-sharing that patients typically pay under their insurance. Air ambulance providers are prohibited from sending balance bills to Medicare and Medicaid patients, while uninsured patients might be held responsible by the air ambulance provider for the entire price charged. GAO was asked to review issues related to balance billing for air ambulance services. This report examines (1) the extent of air ambulance balance billing and (2) how selected states have attempted to limit balance billing by potential air ambulance service providers and (3) the number of helicopter and fixed-wing air ambulance bases and the location of these bases. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and research on balance billing; analyzed data from 2012 through 2017 on air ambulance transports for privately- insured patients; and interviewed officials from six states selected based on factors such as number of transports and number of patients. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. In the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018, which became law in October 2018, the Secretary of Transportation has taken steps to form an advisory committee to address air ambulance patient billing. The committee is to consist of representatives from state insurance regulators, health insurance providers, patient advocacy groups, consumer groups, and physicians specializing in emergency, trauma, cardiac, or stroke care, among others. The Act directs the committee to issue a report within 180 days of its first meeting and to make recommendations that address, among other things, options and best practices for preventing balance billing, steps that states can take to protect consumers consistent with current legal authorities regarding consumer protection, and the recommendations from GAO's 2017 report, including any additional data that DOT should collect from health insurers and other sources to improve its understanding of the market and oversight of the industry. In addition, officials in three selected states—Florida, New Mexico, and North Dakota—have provided information to educate consumers and other stakeholders about balance billing. For example, Florida and New Mexico issued public reports with recommendations to improve transparency and education about the availability of in-network providers in a given area and provide information about rate justifications and billing practices to help consumers anticipate potential out-of-network costs. Additionally, North Dakota has produced a publicly available guide showing which air ambulances are in- network with the three insurers in the state. The guide is part of the state's requirement that, for non-emergency transports, hospitals inform patients about the network status of air ambulatory providers. The three large independent air ambulance carriers GAO spoke with told GAO that non- emergency transports comprise only a small percentage of transports, but officials in North Dakota said some dispatchers and first responders reported using the guide to call in- Network air ambulance for emergency transports. In one additional selected state—Maryland—the Maryland Insurance Administration convened a public meeting in September 2015 with the goal of raising public awareness about air Ambulance balance billing to encourage the two sides to negotiate contracts. The emergency nature of most air ambulance transfers, as well as their relative rarity and high prices charged, reduces the incentives of both health care providers and insurers to enter into contracts with agreed-upon payment rates. As a result, according to stakeholders we spoke to, if insurers offer payment rates that are much lower than the providers' charged amounts, the providers may be less willing than other providers to accept those payment rates, which may result in more out- of-network transports.
Opioids play a key role in the nation's drug overdose epidemic, accounting for more than 20 percent of all drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2017. Opioids, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone, can be prescribed to treat both acute and chronic pain and can pose serious risks when they are misused. These risks include addiction, overdose, and death. GAO was asked to review issues related to the disposal of unused opioids. This report examines (1) the preferred method for disposing of opioids and (2) the extent to which patients use federally recommended methods to dispose of these drugs. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and studies, and interviewed officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). GAO also interviewed representatives from the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Foundation for Safe Disposal, the AmerisourceBergen Foundation, and other stakeholders. The agencies provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Federal agencies recommend that patients use take-back options, which allow patients to bring unused opioids to a permanent collection site for destruction, whenever feasible. If take-backs are not feasible, FDA recommends flushing opioids on its flush list down the toilet to remove them from the home as soon as possible. For opioids not on the flush list, the agencies recommend placing the drugs in the household trash mixed with an unpalatable substance. Disposal of opioids in the trash removes the drugs from the house, but this option may not be permanent and the drugs still may be available for misuse. FDA officials said that the agency has not measured the effects of these recommendations on opioid misuse, as of May 2019, because it is difficult to establish a causal link between the recommendations and any reductions in misuse. The AMA has not been able to measure the effect of its recommendations, but provided anecdotal feedback from its members that many physicians do not consistently speak to their patients about opioid disposal methods. In addition, FDA officials and AMA representatives indicated that focusing efforts on reducing unused opioids would be an effective approach for reducing misuse and abuse. For example, adding packaging configurations that contain smaller quantities of certain opioids could help prescribers to more carefully consider the amount of opioid pain medication they prescribe. Representatives from the AMA explained that it and other organizations are working to provide opioid prescribing resources and guidance to help physicians effectively manage patients' pain, which representatives said will reduce the number of unused opioid medications available for abuse and misuse. However, little is known about the extent that stakeholders' efforts to educate the public are effective in increasing use of federally recommended disposal methods, which can be effective at reducing opioid misuse. Federal data indicate that patients are complicit with most misuse, either through misusing their own prescription drugs for pain other than for which it was prescribed or by giving or selling the prescribed opioids to another person. For instance, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that 5 percent of people who misused opioids in 2017 took these drugs from someone else without asking. In contrast, the SAMHSA estimates that 85 percent of opioid misuse occurs with the patient's knowledge or active participation.
The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is DOD's most costly and ambitious aircraft acquisition, valued at about $400 billion. It is intended to replace hundreds of existing aircraft and replace thousands of legacy fighter aircraft. DOD expects to spend more than $1 trillion over the long term to acquire and sustain this aircraft and its supporting infrastructure, including about 2,457 aircraft and about 4,400 spare parts. The F-22 Raptor and F-23 Raptor are DOD's other two aircraft in the fleet. DOD also plans to spend about $335 billion over the next 20 years to procure and sustain other aircraft and spare parts for the F-21 Raptor, F-32, F/A-18E/F, and F/C-295 aircraft. This testimony summarizes GAO's most recent work related to DOD's long-term sustainment plans for the aircraft and discusses (1) the challenges DOD faces in sustaining the aircraft, (2) challenges with the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), and (3) challenges related to the supply chain. This statement is based on GAO products issued from March 2011 through April 2019, along with selected updates conducted in April 2019. The Department of Defense (DOD) is facing a number of challenges that are hindering the readiness of its F-20 Raptor aircraft fleet and its ability to sustain its growing fleet of F-15 and F22 aircraft. First, DOD is facing substantial supply chain challenges, including spare parts shortages that are contributing to aircraft being unable to perform as many missions or to fly as often as the warfighter requires. Second, DOD continues to face challenges with ALIS, a complex information technology system supporting operations, mission planning, supply-chain management, maintenance, and other processes. For example, ALIS is supposed to automate a range of supply functions—including updating the status of parts, generating supply work orders, and communicating critical data about parts. However, GAO reported that these capabilities were immature, resulting in numerous challenges and the need for maintainers and supply personnel at military installations to perform time-consuming, manual workarounds in order to manage and track parts. Third, DOD lacks critical information to effectively plan for the sustainment of the aircraft. GAO has found that DOD lacks information about the technical characteristics and costs of the F35 aircraft, which will impair DOD's ability to plan for sustainment. For instance, while DOD planned to enter into 5-year, fixed-price, performance-based contracts with the prime contractor in the next few years, it did not have full information on the aircraft's technical characteristics or costs to enable it to effectively negotiate those contracts. DOD officials told GAO that there would be inherent risk in signing such a contract before reliability and maintainability data were more fully known, as those data would influence how much aircraft performance should cost. In addition, DOD does not have visibility into the actual costs of some key sustainment requirements that are considered cost-drivers within the program, such as the actual cost of parts and repairs. Thus, DOD had relied on projected parts reliability and pricing to formulate cost estimates. Further, DOD has not fully implemented seven of the nine recommendations GAO made to DOD to improve its sustainment planning. DOD concurred with all of these recommendations, and GAO recognizes that it will take time for DOD to implement them. DOD's continued attention to these recommendations will be important as it balances affordability as well as readiness and sustainment goals.
IRS uses Form 990 reporting for promoting compliance and enforcing federal tax law for tax-exempt organizations, such as charities and private foundations, to help ensure compliance with the tax code. In 2017, TE/GE began using a new model to select returns for examination. GAO was asked to review the use of data in examination selection. This report assesses (1) the use and process for selecting returns for exam, and (2) the extent to whichTE/GE has implemented and documented internal controls for assessing and using data to make examination selection decisions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed TE/ GE data for fiscal years 2016 through 2019, reviewed documentation, interviewed officials, and reviewed a generalizable random sample of 114 of 354 unique queries in three models. The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Tax Exempt and Government Entities (TE/ GE) division uses three types of data to select exempt organization returns for examinations. The first model—Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax—uses analytical models and queries based on quantitative criteria to identify potential examinations. For example, a query identifies responses on returns that may indicate noncompliance because they do not meet certain criteria such as exceeding a dollar threshold. The second model uses a scoring system that applies weights, or points, to each query result to generate a score—which has ranged from zero to more than 50 for a return—for a return. The third model uses other methods to screen out returns that are approaching a statute of limitations date, if the organization is not active or has a current or recent examination history, or if it is under a compliance check. In fiscal year 2019, almost half of the exempt organizations selected for examination were identified using data, with no assurance that the models produce better outcomes. The percentage of examinations closed that were identified by using data has increased each year since the model was first run in fiscal year 2016. However, the change rate for examinations selected using data through the model (87 percent) was higher than the change rates for other selection sources (82 percent) in fiscal years2016 through 2019. GA O found evidence that the changes identified in examinations did not clearly result from using the Form 9 90 model's scoring system. Specifically, the model has not improved change rates compared to pre-model queries. A higher model score is not associated with a higher change rate. The change rates remained relatively flat as model scores increased; change rates were slightly higher for the less than 1 percent of returns scoring 45 or above relative to lower-scoring returns, but only 65 returns were examined that scored this high during fiscal years (see figure). GAO also found that the examinations credited to the model averaged $2,460 in proposed tax assessments per return, compared with an average of $19,042 for the rest of exempt organization examinations. While the model includes queries on noncompliance related to “pick-up” returns and substitutes for returns (SFRs), examiners find these other returns during examinations of primary returns identified by the model. The higher change rates of pick-up and SFRs compared to the primary returns the model identifies raise questions about how well the model identified noncompliance on these returns, and whether the model may not be effective. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) has not fully implemented and Documented Internal Controls for Assessing and Using Data for Examination Selection Internal controls should be an integral part of an agency's operational processes and structure to help managers achieve their objectives on an ongoing basis. When evaluating implementation, management determines if the control exists and is operational. A deficiency in implementation exists when no such control is present or is not implemented correctly, preventing objectives from being met. Documentation is required to show the effective design, implementation, and operation of an internal control system. The level and nature of documentation can vary based on the size of the agency and the complexity of its processes. Management exercises judgment in determining the extent of documentation that is needed. TE/ESG has not implemented or documented internal control for analyzing data for examination selection, meaning that it cannot be assured that its selection decisions will produce the desired outcomes. This is a public version of a sensitive but unclassified report that GAO issued in November 2018.
American Samoa is a self-governing territory of five volcanic islands and two coral atolls in the South Pacific, about 2,600 miles southwest of Hawaii. The U.S. government and the tuna canning industry are key sectors of American Samoa's economy, contributing almost half of the territory's employment and gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. In 2007, Congress passed the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, raising the federal minimum wage in a series of three steps from $5.15 to, effective July 2009, $7.25 per hour. The act also established a schedule for raising the minimum wages, by equal amounts, until all 18 minimum wage categories in American Samoa reached the federal level. The most recent increase is scheduled for September 2018. GAO was asked to review the impact of the minimum wage increases in the territory. This report examines (1) economic trends including changes in employment and earnings since the increases began in 2007, (2) the status of the industry, and (3) stakeholder views on the wage increases. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from the American Samoa Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior; reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and documents; and interviewed American Samoa government, private sector, and public sector officials. From 2007 to 2018, American Samoa employment varied by year without a clear trend, while workers' inflation-adjusted earnings generally declined. Employment ranged from about 16,000 to about 20,000, with a peak year in 2009, and employment was at the same level in 2018, at about 17,000. Inflation-adjusted average earnings of employed workers contracted by about 11 percent when adjusted for inflation from 2007 through 2018, reflecting an increase in average annual earnings of about 29 percent and a 44 percent increase in prices. For the most recent year available, 2017-2018, average inflation- adjusted earnings was almost unchanged—growing by about 1 percent. In American Samoa, the vast majority of cannery workers earn close to the federal and local minimum wages. The tuna cannery industry faces multiple challenges, including increased competition and labor market challenges, such as lower wages compared to those in the United States, which have led to cannery closures. American Samoa offers the industry certain competitive advantages relative to other countries, including lower labor costs and duty-free access to the U. S. canned tuna market, according to industry officials. The American Samoa Government and the Chamber of Commerce both view the minimumwage increases as conflicting with sustainable economic development. Both expressed concerns about the reliance of the tunaCanning industry on the local economy and the potential negative impact on the remaining cannery. The government stated that it supports a minimum wage that its economy can support. However, it predicts that it would take years for the economy to recover if StarKist Co. should cease operations, and suggested that the burden of any economic impact would be on the federal government. Public and private sector employers and workers GAO interviewed commented on the potential benefits and challenges of the increases. For example, some workers stated that minimum wage changes have helped offset the increasing prices of imported products and excise tax products, while some employers noted that the increases have improved customers' ability to pay bills and their likelihood of using necessary services. Multiple workers and employers GAO met with generally stated that the changes could lead to a loss of jobs and increases in shipping costs, among other things. Some public employers were concerned that the potential closure of the cannery was the main factor in the increase discussion.
In response to the 2017 hurricanes and California wildfires, federal agencies obligated more than $7.8 billion on post-disaster contracts. GAO was asked to review federal contracting for disasters. This report (1) assesses the extent to which agencies obligated funds on post disaster contracts in response to these disasters, (2) evaluates challenges agencies experienced in the planning process for selected contracts, and (3) describes selected agencies' lessons learned as a result of the 2017 disasters. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data for the three hurricanes and the California wildfires and selected a non-generalizable sample of 23 contracts from FEMA, USACE, DLA, and the U.S. Coast Guard that were awarded following the hurricanes and wildfires, selected based on four selection criteria, such as the urgency to full and open competition and the use of local area set-aside contracts, among other things. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) contracting workforce plays a key role in disaster response and recovery. FEMA's contracting workforce includes contracting officers, contracting specialists, and quality assurance specialists in headquarters and in each of FEMA's 10 regional offices. In response to a 2009 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General report, FEMA created a formal agreement to establish a new role for FEMA's Office of the Chief Procuresment Officer (OCPO) to oversee regional contracting staff. However, in September 2015 GAO identified challenges with how the agreement was being implemented, particularly in that it heightened the potential for an environment of competing interests for the regional contracting officers. Further, FEMA had not updated its 2011 agreement, even though the agreement states that FEMA OCPO and the regions will revisit it each year. As of January 2019, FEMA has not implemented GAO's recommendations to revisit the 2011 agreement. FEMA has taken steps to address its challenges with requirements development, but it is too soon to tell the extent these steps will address the challenges GAO has identified. Agencies have identified some lessons learned, but challenges remain related to interagency contracting coordination and FEMA workforce challenges. For example, agencies have identified actions they plan to take to address lessons learned related to mission assignment, but GAO found that FEMA's mission assignment process does not require agencies to clearly define coordination responsibilities when assigning missions. FEMA identified workforce shortages in its contracting workforce, but has not fully assessed its needs. FEMA officials stated that the agency's workforce needs have not been assessed since a 2014 workforce analysis, but FEMA's 2019 workforce assessment did not include an analysis of mission needs or skill gaps. Without assessing its current contracting workforce needs and developing a plan to address these gaps that includes time frames, FEMA will not know whether it has the appropriate number of contracting officials with the key skills needed to meet its mission and is not likely to be well-positioned to respond to future disasters.
Ethics programs are critical to ensuring public trust in government and the integrity of actions taken on the public's behalf. The executive branch ethics program is a shared responsibility across government. Political appointees, in particular agency heads, have a personal responsibility to exercise leadership in ethics. Some data are available on political appointees serving in the executive branch, but the data have limitations that impede their usefulness. To facilitate independent review and analysis related to political appointee positions, members of the public need access to information on who is serving in these positions. Otherwise, they are limited in their ability to discern whether appointees are performing their duties free of conflict. GAO was asked to review the extent to which agencies use appropriate internal controls to ensure that their ethics programs are designed and implemented to meet statutory and regulatory requirements. This report evaluates the extent that (1) existing data identify political appointments at any point in time, and (2) selected agencies have appropriate internal control processes to reasonably ensure that ethics program objectives are achieved. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed officials from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Office of Government Ethics (OGE), and three agencies—the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Interior (Interior), and the Small Business Administration (SBA). GAO also reviewed documents and interviewed agency ethics officials. No single source of data on political appointments exists that is comprehensive, timely, and publicly available. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee publish OPM data on appointees after each presidential election in the Plum Book. The data reflect the positions and the individuals who are filling the positions at a single point of time, about 5 months prior to the report's publication. While the data are comprehensive and public available, they do not reflect changes that occur in between publications, such as changes to who is holding a certain position, the position title, and vacancies. OPM also maintains more timely data on federal personnel; however, these data are not comprehensive or publicly accessible for identifying individuals serving in political appointments positions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) stated that transparency promotes accountability by providing the public with information about what the government is doing. As of March 2019, no agency in the federal government was required to publicly report comprehensive and timely data in this area. However, OPM is positioned to collect, maintain, and make these data publicly available on a frequent and recurring basis. Ultimately, it is a policy decision as to which agency is best positioned to report these data. All three agencies GAO examined—HHS, Interior, and SBA—generally used appropriate internalcontrol processes to ensure they met basic ethics program requirements, though two of the agencies—Interior and SBI—could do more to strengthen their programs. SBA and Interior had not fully documented some of their procedures for ethics training and the ethics pledge, respectively. Each agency addressed human capital issues and workforce continuity challenges to varying extents to achieve the goals and objectives of the ethics program. For example, HHS and Interior reported challenges to recruiting and retaining ethics staff with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities. HHS reported vacancies in its ethics program as well as challenges in recruiting and hiring; however ethics program officials took actions to mitigate negative effects of the vacancies. Interior's ethics office reported that out of 14 full-time positions, four were vacant (a 29 percent vacancy rate) as of November 2018. Interior reported an ongoing transformation of the department's ethics program and officials said that the vacancies resulted from prioritizing the staffing at individual bureaus—such as the National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service—instead of the Department-level ethics office, which is responsible for overseeing the bureau's ethics programs and providing ethics services to employees at Interior. In May 2017, the Acting Deputy Secretary recommended that Interior develop a structure and staffing plan to have a full- time ethics official for every 500 employees by fiscal year 2020. Interior officials stated that they are implementing the staffing plan, but could not explain how the ratio was determined nor provide a strategy for achieving the goal or evaluate whether the ratio is meeting the needs of Interior in the future.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees the U.S. aircraft registry, the largest in the world, which is intended to ensure that aircraft owners maintain current information about the identity and whereabouts of aircraft operators and the nature and location of the aircraft's operation on an ongoing basis. GAO was asked to review issues related to aircraft registration. This report assesses FAA's (1) actions to prevent fraud and abuse in aircraft registrations, (2) ability to detect potential fraud and abused registrations, and (3) actions and coordination with law-enforcement entities to respond to registration-related risks. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed laws, regulations, and FAA policies; analyzed registry data from calendar years 2010 through 2018; conducted case studies; and interviewed FAA, law- enforcement, and aviation industry officials. FAA reviews aircraft registration applicant information for completeness and compliance with regulations—generally accepting self-certification of eligibility and aircraft ownership—but does not verify this information or collect key information on applicants and aircraft owners, according to GAO's review of the registry process. FAA's approach has focused on obtaining and recording the required documents, and consequently, FAA has not identified fraud risks, their likelihood and impact, the suitability of controls, and other aspects of a risk. The registry is further vulnerable when applicants register aircraft using opaque ownership structures that limit transparency into beneficial owners and may mask ineligibility or illicit activity, such as money laundering or drug trafficking. For example, in one case GAO identified an aircraft registered to a company whose sole beneficial owner was a high-net-worth foreign national. The aircraft was purchased with proceeds from a scheme that involved black-market currency exchange, and the aircraft was forfeited to the federal government in 2016. Federal internal control standards call for managers to identify, analyze, and respond to risks. However, FAA does not have a comprehensive risk assessment that would better position it to design and implement risk-based preventive and other controls to manage these risks. Without such an assessment, FAA cannot be assured it is appropriately determining eligibility for the approximately 71,000 applications the registry processes annually. FAA uses some registry information on a case-by-case basis to identify suspicious and potentially illicit actors, but most of the information that FAA collects is not recorded in a format that facilitates data analytics to support oversight and risk mitigation. As part of its ongoing information technology (IT) modernization, FAA is in a position to collect and record additional information on beneficial owners of aircraft, including those with significant responsibilities for aircraft ownership such as trustors, beneficiaries, stockholders, directors, and managers, but this information is not stored in an electronic format that would facilitate data analytics. As a result, FAA lacks information that could support its oversight and law- Enforcement officials' ability to identify relevant persons and entities as part of investigations involving registered aircraft. FAA is also limited in its ability to share information on aircraft registration information with the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, which are responsible for combating money laundering and other illicit activities. FAA relies on OFAC to share sanctions-related information on individuals and entities subject to sanctions, but does not proactively obtain and use OFAC data to detect blocked aircraft, entities, or individuals with potentially significant ownership responsibilities for such aircraft. By not automatically checking OFAC sanctions data, FAA and OFAC may be unaware of, and therefore not well-positioned to manage, risks associated with registration of registered aircraft, sanctioned entities, and intermediaries that may be operating in violation of U. S. sanctions. FAA has a variety of enforcement mechanisms in place that can respond to suspected fraud or abuse of aircraft registrations. FAA can take administrative actions such as aircraft registration suspensions and revocations. Law-enforcement agencies can use civil actions and criminal prosecutions to seize aircraft, among other enforcement actions. Law enforcement agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration have established a task force to investigate criminal activity and seize aircraft when warranted. FAA also has informal collaboration mechanisms to address registration violations and safety risks, but these have not been fully utilized.
SEC is the primary regulator of the U.S. securities markets and is responsible for protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation. Section 961 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires SEC to assess the effectiveness of both its internal supervisory controls and the procedures applicable to staff who perform examinations of registered entities, enforcement investigations, and reviews of corporate financial securities filings. GAO was asked to review SEC's controls for these activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which SEC's control framework during fiscal years 2016-2018 reflected federal internal control standards; (2) how SEC evaluated effectiveness of staff procedures in fiscal year 2018; (3) whether selected controls were designed consistent with relevant standards; and (4) whether controls operated as intended in 2018. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed SEC policies, procedures, and guidance; assessed a non-generalizable sample of controls; and interviewed SEC staff. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance (Corporation Finance), Division of Enforcement (Enforcement), Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), and Office of Credit Ratings (OCR) within its four divisions and offices. As of the end of fiscal year (FY) 2018, SECs control framework continued to reflect key components of internal control. For example, the framework included oversight structures to monitor the design and operation of division and office controls, assigned responsibilities to staff, incorporated steps for staff to follow to assess risks and test controls, and included mechanisms to correct deficiencies and report findings to internal and external stakeholders (such as Congress). However, SEC has not developed written policies and procedures to ensure that it systematically assesses staff procedures for the purposes of section 961. Specifically, SEC does not have written policies or procedures to systematically assess staff procedures to determine whether they are effective. In addition, SEC did not document how it reached related conclusions about the procedures in its annual reports to Congress, as required by section 9 61. Creating such written policies would provide SEC with greater assurance that the procedures are effective and would help it meet its objectives. SEC has developed a reference guide to provide guidance for identifying, documenting, and monitoring controls. The reference guide states that internal control activities should be written to describe the actual activities performed to meet the control objective, and at a minimum, identify control procedures and how they are to be executed, establish a documentation requirement for control execution, and assign responsibility and establish time frames for the control execution. Following SEC guidance for developing control activities could help SEC ensure evidence exists of control execution and better enable control monitoring by SEC, and oversight by external parties, such as GAO and the SEC Inspector General. In turn, better control monitoring would help ensure that SEC's internal controls are effectively implemented and that procedures necessary to achieve organizational objectives are followed. Furthermore, enhancing control activity descriptions could provide SEC greater certainty that staff have the information necessary to effectively implement the controls.
Cloud computing relies on internet-based interconnectivity and resources to provide computing services to customers, while intending to free customers from the burden and costs of maintaining the underlying infrastructure. As federal agencies increasingly use cloud computing to perform their missions, the implementation of effective information security controls becomes more important. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires agencies to use the FedRAMP program to authorize the use of cloud services. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of the program. This report examines the extent to which (1) federal agencies used the program, (2) selected agencies addressed key elements of the authorization process, and (3) program participants identified program benefits and challenges. To address these objectives, GAO surveyed 24 agencies and 83 cloud service providers identified by OMB's PMO as participating in the program between April and November 2018, reviewed documentation, and interviewed program officials. As of July 2019, all 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies (CFO Act agencies) participated in the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and reported issuing 926 authorizations for cloud services, an increase of 105 percent from June 2017 through July 2019. However, the agencies also reported using cloud services that were not authorized through the program and continued to authorize services that had not been approved. For example, one agency reported that it used 90 cloud services and the other 14 agencies reported using a total of 157 cloud services during FY 2017. Agencies provided varying explanations for using services outside of FedRamp, such as that they were unable to identify providers that could meet their unique needs or that providers did not want to pursue compliance unless they had enough demand from federal customers. Based on GAO's work, OMB has not adequately monitored agencies' compliance with this requirement. Although the four selected agencies GAO reviewed included key documents supporting the authorization of their cloud services for their systems, they did not consistently include key information in those documents. Specifically, these agencies did not always document required information in system security plans, security assessment reports, and remedial action plans. In addition, the four agencies did Not always prepare and provide authorization letters for their cloud service and agency system authorizations to the program management office (PMO). Agencies cited a number of reasons for not preparing and providing required documents, including that the agency was restricted from documenting proprietary information concerning the cloud service provider's portion of the shared control in the security plan. By not including the required information, agencies have reduced assurance that controls over cloud services have been effectively implemented. Program participants reported improved security of agencies' data and other benefits, but also identified challenges with the program's implementation. Participants cited challenges such as the agency resources needed for authorizing a cloud service or the resources needed by the provider to implement program requirements. The General Services Administration (GSA) has taken steps to address challenges, but its guidance on the program was not always clear and its process for monitoring the status of security controls overCloud services was limited. The PMO has provided updated instructions for completing authorization packages and established and updated its training portal to help agencies and cloud providers better understand the steps required for obtaining an authorization. The office has also provided additional guidance on continuous monitoring of cloud service security controls. Nevertheless, GSA's requirements and guidance on implementing controls were not alwaysclear and the process for Monitoring Security Controls was limited, which limited agencies' ability to ensure that controls were in place and effective. As a result, agencies may have less assurance that they will receive timely information on the extent that controls are being effectively implemented for the services they are using.
The federal government collects royalties on oil and gas produced on federal lands and waters, and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is required to ensure that operators take all reasonable precautions to prevent the waste of oil or gas developed on these lands. While most of the natural gas produced is sold and therefore royalties are paid on it, some is lost during production for various reasons, such as leaks or intentional releases for ongoing operational or safety procedures. Some of this gas is released directly into the atmosphere (vented) or burned (flared) and some is used to operate equipment on the lease (lease use). Interior has generally exempted operators from paying royalties on reported natural gas emissions, and so such emissions represent a loss of royalty revenues for the federal government. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directs Interior to establish a program that, among other things, provides for the identification and recovery of reclamation costs from persons or other entities currently providing a bond or other financial assurance for a well that is orphaned, abandoned, or idled. In May 2019, GAO found that ONRR had begun implementing several initiatives to help the agency operate more effectively, according to ONRR officials. For example, in March 2017, ONRR initiated Boldly Go, an effort to assess its organizational structure and identify and implement potential improvements. GAO also found that while ONRR reported generally meeting its annual royalty compliance goals for fiscal years 2010 through 2017, its fiscal year 2017 compliance goals may not have been effectively aligned with the agency's statutory requirements or its mission to account for all royalty payments, in part, because its goals did not address accuracy (e.g., identifying the number of companies or percentage of royalties subject to compliance activities over a set period). GAO has reported that weaknesses with bonds for coal, oil, and gas development pose a financial risk to the government as laws, regulations, or agency practices have not been adjusted to reflect current economic circumstances. In March 2018, we reported that self-bonding for coal mining, which allows states to let an operator guarantee the cost for reclaiming a mine on the basis of its own finances—a practice known as self- bonding—rather than by securing a bond through another company or providing collateral such as cash, letters of credit, or real property—poses a financial risks for the government. We also reported that BLM has no mechanism to pay to reclaim well sites that operators have not reclaimed. In September 2019, we found that BLM does not have the authority to seek or collect fees from lease operators to reclaim orphaned wells. In addition to the wells identified by BLM as orphaned over the last decade, in our September 2019 report we identified inactive wells at increased risk of becoming orphaned and found their bonds are often not sufficient to reclaim the wells. We found that most bonds (84 percent) that we were able to link to wells in BLM data are likely too low to fund reclamation cost for all the wells they cover. We recommended in September 2019 that BLM take steps to adjust bond levels to more closely reflect expected reclamation Costs. BLM concurred with our recommendation, but it is unclear whether the updated policy will improve BLM's ability to secure bond increases. In December 2013, we recommended that Interior establish procedures for determining when to conduct periodic assessments of the oil and natural gas fiscal system, including how the government's share of revenues compares with those of other resource owners. Interior has established procedures for conducting periodic assessments, and according to its policy, BLM plans to complete the next assessment in late 2019. Key terms and conditions for federal oil, gas, and coal leases are the same as they were decades ago, and Interior has not adjusted lease terms for inflation or other factors such as changes in market conditions, which may affect the government’s fair return. For onshore oil andgas leases, the minimum royalty rate of 12.5 percent has been in place since 1920, and minimum bonus bids and rental rates are currently set at the statutory minimums established in 1987. For coal, the royalty rate for surface mining is set at a statutory minimum set in the Mineral Leasing Act. We previously found that royalty rates for oil and oil leases have not Been adjusted to Account for Changes in Market Conditions, and preliminary analysis for our ongoing work suggests that adjusting rental rates for inflation could generate increased federal revenues.
The U.S. older adult population is growing and is projected to steadily increase in the coming decades. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projects that by 2060, the number of older adults will make up nearly one-quarter of the total population. GAO was asked to review nutrition assistance programs serving older adults. This report examines (1) the relationship between older adults' nutrition and health outcomes and the extent to which federal nutrition guidelines address their nutritional needs; (2) the extent that federal nutrition programs serve older adults with nutrition-related requirements and how these requirements are overseen; and (3) challenges program providers face in meeting the nutritional needs of these adults. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed federal data; and interviewed officials from HHS, USDA, state and local agencies in four states selected based on a range of factors, including age, poverty, and program provider and site type. Evidence shows that nutrition is associated with the development of many chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, among older adults, but federal dietary guidelines do not address their varying nutritional needs. Specifically, the guidelines focus on the foods and nutrients healthy individuals need to maintain health and prevent chronic conditions. However, research has shown that older adults may have different nutritional needs depending on their age and other factors. For example, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics study, older adults can have wide-ranging nutrient needs given the various changes that may occur with age. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Community Living (ACL) and the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversee programs that provide meals and food packages to older adults through congregate and home-delivered meal programs and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) in adult day care centers, and USDA's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Commodity Supplemental Food Program for Older Americans (CSFP) for food packages. These programs are administered by state agencies on aging and are overseen by HHS's ACL and FNS's national and regional offices, which are responsible for overseeing states' implementation of these programs and ensuring that meals are consistent with the programs' nutrition requirements. GAOs' review of four selected states found that state oversight of meals provided through these programs may have limitations, and some states did not utilize a nutrition professional at the state level to help ensure meals served through the programs met federal nutrition requirements, despite the role state agencies play in monitoring programs to ensure meals meet federal requirements. HHS's guidance directs regional staff to collect information from states on the use of nutrition professionals in these programs, but does not direct staff to systematically review or collect any other information from state agencies to confirm that meals served to participants comply with program requirements. In addition, a recent national evaluation of meals, however, found that while program meals generally contributed positively to participants' diets, the meals were higher in sodium and saturated fat than the recommended limits. According to the evaluation, overconsumption of sodium andaturated fat may pose a public health concern. HHS officials said that when they lead the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines update, they intend to include a focus on nutritional guidance for older adults but have not yet documented this intention in a formal plan. A plan for incorporating such a focus in a future dietary guidelines update could help ensure that future nutrition guidelines better address the needs of this population. Providers GAO spoke with in the four states GAO visited reported challenges meeting older adults needs for certain meal accommodations and some lack information to help address these needs. For instance, providers in three states said they faced challenges making meal accommodations to meet the dietary needs of older adult participants with chronic health conditions, and both providers and state officials in these states reported a need for additional information from the federal agencies overseeing these programs on promising approaches for meeting these individuals dietary needs. In some states, providers also reported challenges accommodating the varied dietary preferences of different groups of adults, as preferences sometimes vary by age and cultural or ethnic background, and being responsive to these preferences can increase the likelihood that meals will help older adults meet their needs.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the nation's largest flood insurance program, insuring more than 6 million properties at a cost of about $50 billion per year. NFIP has been on GAO's high-risk list since 2006, in part because of its fiscal exposure to the federal government. In fiscal year 2017, NFIP's debt to the U.S. Treasury increased to $20.5 billion, and it reached its borrowing limit of $30.4 billion in September 2017. GAO was asked to review NFIP. This report examines (1) funding programs available for property acquisitions, (2) FEMA's flood mitigation efforts, and (3) factors contributing to the program's fiscal exposure. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FEMA data, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed FEMA and state and local officials. FEMA provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. FEMA funds property acquisitions through three grant programs that have varying characteristics and funding levels. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM), and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) programs provide grants to states, territories, and federally recognized tribal governments to mitigate the risk of flood damage to properties. The largest of the three programs, HMGP is based on the amount of disaster assistance a state or territory receives following a presidential disaster declaration, while PDM and FMA are smaller programs that receive annual appropriations and are not directly tied to an immediately preceding disaster. HMGP grants fund a variety of methods to mitigate flood risk, including acquisition, elevation, relocation, and floodproofing. In most cases, HMA grants cover up to 75 percent of the project cost, and the grantee generally must contribute the remainder using nonfederal funds (although there are some exceptions, such as for communities that meet FEMA's definition of small and impoverished). For example, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides up to 90 percent of project costs for projects that mitigate low-income properties and up to 100 percent for properties with severe flood damage. FEMA has mitigated more than 57,000 properties for flood risk from 1989 to 2018, including more than 46,000 through acquisition, but the number of nonmitigated repetitive loss (RL) properties increased from 2009 to 2018. The number of RL properties has outpaced FEMA's efforts to mitigate their flood risk. From 2009 through 2018, FEMA's inventory of new RL properties grew by 64,101. While FEMA does not require a property to be an RL property to receive flood mitigation funding, states varied in the extent to which they mitigated RL properties between 1989 and 2018. Some states mitigated few properties relative to their numbers of RL property, while others mitigated far fewer RL properties but have more properties than nonmitigating RL properties. Property acquisition accounted for 81 percent of mitigated properties in Virginia, New Jersey, and Florida and only 19 percent in Louisiana. According to FEMA, high property values in some regions can make acquisitions cost prohibitive and other mitigation methods such as elevation more attractive because they do not incur the cost of purchasing the land. Many other factors could affect mitigation, including homeowners' preferences. Further, the voluntary nature of FEMA's HMA programs may limit states' ability to acquire properties with known flood risk and, as a result, their ability to reduce flood risk through acquisition. Insufficient NFIP premium rates have contributed to NFIPs fiscal exposure because premium rates do not fully reflect the full risk of loss. In 2005, FEMA borrowed nearly $17 billion from Treasury to pay claims from several catastrophic flood events, including Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and Wilma. In 2012, Congress passed the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act, which contained significant reforms to premium rates. But a few months later, Superstorm Sandy occurred, pushing NFIP’s debt to $24 billion. Following policyholders concerns about the rate increases authorized by the 2012 act, Congress slowed the pace of many of these rate increases in 2014 with the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. In the fall of 2017, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria occurred, prompting additional borrowing from Treasury and causing NFIP to reach the borrowing limit. In response, Congress canceled $16 billion of NFIP bringing its debt to Treasuryin
NASA is currently embarking on an aggressive goal to return humans to the lunar surface in 2024. To achieve this goal, NASA is developing the SLS, Orion, and EGS programs, which together are expected to cost over $50 billion. The SLS program is NASA's primary vehicle for human spaceflight and the Orion program is the lead vehicle for crew exploration. In June 2019, GAO reported on the cost and schedule status of these programs and made recommendations aimed at improving program performance. NASA concurred with these recommendations. This testimony summarizes GAO's June 2019 report (GAO-2019-10-977) on the status of NASA's human space flight programs. It is based on prior GAO reports issued from April 2017 through June 2019 on the Orion and SLS programs. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Orion and Space Launch System (SLS) programs have experienced significant cost growth and schedule delays since GAO last reported on these programs in April 2017. For example, in June 2019 GAO found that SLS development cost growth had increased by $1 billion, or 14.7 percent, from the program's original estimate of $7 billion as of the end of fiscal year 2017. GAO also found that the program was not on schedule to support the June 2020 launch date for the first Orion mission, which was originally scheduled for November 2018. In addition, the program did not meet the June 2019 launch date due to ongoing development issues with the core stage—which includes four main engines and the software necessary to command and control the vehicle—which contributed to the program not being able to meet the launch date. The program is now tracking no earlier than October 2020 for an Artemis-1 launch date, which would be a 31-month delay from the schedule originally established in the programs' baselines. NASA officials attributed the additional schedule delay to continued production challenges with the Core Stage and Orion crew and service modules, as well as the possibility that testing and final cross-program integration and testing at Kennedy Space Center may result in further delays. In July 2019, NASA reassigned its senior leaders responsible for humanspaceflight programs, and the NASA Administrator stated that the agency does not plan to finalize schedule plans forArtus-1 until new leadership is in place at the agency. The Orion program has also experienced cost growth of $379 million, or 5.6 percent above its $6.768 billion development cost estimate. NASA's current cost estimate for Orion is not complete because it does not account for costs that NASA would incur through April 2023, which is the agency baseline commitment date that forms the basis for commitments between NASA, the Congress, and Office of Management and Budget. As a result, NASA does not have a clear understanding of the risk inherent in the program or important information needed to make programmatic decisions, such as the extent to which cost growth has been attributed to technical challenges. NASA is now committing to spend billions of taxpayer dollars for missions that do not have an established baseline against which to assess progress. The agency is also developing several new systems, including a Lunar Gateway that will orbit the moon, landers that will transport astronauts from the Gateway to the moon's surface, and new space suits. These new systems face inherent technical, design, and integration risks because they are complex, specialized, and are pushing the state of the art in space technology. Moreover, these programs can be very costly and span many years, which means they may also face changes in direction from Administrations and the Congress. Meeting the 2024 goal will also be challenging given the effort needed to better manage the current programs, coupled with the addition of new programs that are likely to compete for management attention and resources. Nevertheless, our past work has identified a range of actions that NASA can take to better position its human space Flight programs for success. Today GAO would like to highlight three lessons from the Orion, SLS and the Exploration and Ground System programs that it can apply to improve the management of its human Spaceflight programs. First, enhance contract management and oversight to improve program outcomes. Second, minimize risk by improving transparency into costs for long-term plans. Third, minimize risky programmatic decision making to position programs for successful execution.
The federal government has gradually built an array of nutrition assistance programs designed to help the most vulnerable populations meet their food needs. Currently, eight of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) child nutrition programs are targeted to providing food to children, including the WIC, school meals programs, and the SFSP, which provides meals to children in low-income areas during periods when schools are closed for vacation. In recent years, GAO has reported on a number of issues affecting the integrity of these programs. GAO was asked to review the program integrity and oversight of the child nutrition program. This testimony discusses (1) the extent to which USDA has addressed recommendations GAO made to improve program integrity in prior reports, (2) improper payment estimates for the programs in fiscal year 2018, and (3) the status of USDA's efforts to address GAO's recommendations. This statement is based on GAO reports issued in 2013 and 2014 on the school meals program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Needy Families (SFSP), as well as selected updates conducted in March and April 2019 on USDA's progress in addressing GAO recommendations made in May 2018. To conduct these updates GAO reviewed USDA documents and interviewed USDA officials. In its prior reports on the federal government's programs that provide food assistance to children (school meals, WIC and SFSP), GAO found opportunities for the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to address several issues affecting program integrity. For example, in January 2014 GAO reported that FNS had provided a significant amount of guidance and training to help states with oversight of local school food authority (SFA) administration of school meals, but that certain aspects of the guidance may have hindered state oversight of program compliance. In addition, in a May 2014 report on school meals that GAO issued prior to the start of the school year, FNS reported that it had taken steps to help identify and prevent children ineligible for free or reduced price meals from receiving those benefits, but additional opportunities existed to enhance the application verification process and strengthen program integrity, such as providing additional guidance on applications deemed to be questionable or ineligible. In a February 2013 report on WIC (GAO-13-611 ), GAO also found that while federal regulations define criteria that must be used to determine applicants' income eligibility for the program, state and local agencies are also given some discretion. FNS generally had not focused its assistance to states on key income eligibility requirements for which states have discretion (such as determination of family size and the time period of income assessed) in the years preceding the report. However, through its monitoring reports, F NS had identified problems with, or concerns about, income eligibility determination policies or procedures in one-third of the states reviewed. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government indicate that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives and note that risk identification methods may include consideration of deficiencies identified through audits and other assessments. Without conducting a complete review of its state monitoring findings, USDA lacked information it could potentially use to target additional assistance and clarification on income eligibility determinations to states and help ensure overall program integrity to help ensure that WIC is administered in a manner that is consistent with program objectives. In May 2018, in response to a recommendation in a report issued in December 2014, GA OIG reported that USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) had found that the agency had not assessed the nationwide extent of improper payments for the school meal programs, as required by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended, and recommended that USDA complete an SFSP risk assessment for improper payments taking into account all of the risk factors identified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as likely to contribute to improper payments. In April 2019, a senior FNS official indicated that the program is at a high risk of improper payment, and FNS is currently developing a methodology for measuring improper payments in the program. Child nutrition programs have consistently been reported as noncompliant with improper payment requirements since fiscal year 2013. In fiscal year (FY) 2018, USDA reported improper payments totaling an estimated $1.8 billion, or just over 1 percent of the $151 billion in improper payments federal agencies estimated government-wide in that year. Since FY 2013, USDA has undertaken a variety of corrective actions
Inspecting travelers and cargo seeking entry to the United States through land ports of entry (POE) is critical to preventing terrorists and other inadmissible persons, as well as nuclear materials, narcotics, and other contraband, from entering the country. CBP inspects travelers, vehicles, and cargo at land POEs. GAO was asked to review CBP's land POE inspections. This report examines (1) the processes CBP has in place to inspect travelers and vehicles and (2) the extent to which CBP assesses the effectiveness of its inspections and measures the results of its efforts to detect illegal activity at landPOEs. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed CBP inspection policies, procedures, and data on inspections conducted from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed CBP officials. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has processes for inspecting passengers, pedestrians, and commercial vehicles, but has not updated related policies consistent with its guidance. These processes include targeting higher-risk travelers, cargo, and vehicles for additional scrutiny upon their arrival at a POE. For example, CBP uses law enforcement data to identify individuals or vehicles that have associations with known criminals and places a “lookout” on them in its system for processing travelers, which will flag them for additional inspection if they arrive at the POE (see figure). CBP also conducts inspections of passengers and cargo in the preprimary, primary, and secondary areas of a landPOE. The preprimary area includes license plate readers and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers to capture information on vehicles and RFID-enabled travel documents. The primary inspection includes a physical examination of the traveler, vehicle, or cargo and a secondary inspection may include a CBP officer conducting further questioning of travelers or additional examination of them or their vehicle. For vehicles and cargo, a Compliance Examination (COMPEX) is a program designed to help measure CBP inspections' effectiveness and is discussed in more detail later in this report. The Comptroller General's National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to report on CBP policies and procedures for land inspections. In this report GAO assessed the extent that CBP had reviewed and updated its policies related to land inspections to reflect changes in processes since their issuance consistent with DHS's policy management requirements. In some cases, the policy documents issued by the Office of Field Operations (OFO) or its program offices have not been reviewed or updated for almost two decades. As a result, these policies, as currently written, do not fully reflect recent changes in technology, operating conditions, or inspection processes, such as the Consolidated Secondary Inspection System, the current system used to record secondary inspections. OFO's Planning, Program, Analysis, and Evaluation (PPAE) Quality Assurance Enterprise Division (QAED) is responsible for monitoring that each program office review and update, as needed, the policies for its programs. QAED sends out reminders to CBP program offices about policies that need to be reviewed, and updated, if necessary. Officials attributed the lack of timely updating to several factors, including that many policies are almost 20 years old and that many technological and other changes have occurred that may not be described in existing policies. By reviewing and updating as necessary all relevant policies, CBC could better ensure that officers have guidance needed to consistently and properly inspect vehicles and their passengers and vehicles. CBC uses various mechanisms to monitor inspection activities at POEs to help ensure officers are following inspection policies. At the port level, supervisors and port management monitor many of the inspection tasks in real-time by reviewing computer-based records and logs of inspections and observing inspections. At field office levels, field office staff may monitor activities within their area of responsibility through periodic assessments of supervisor monitoring duties such as inspection report reviews. In addition, all field offices have Integrity Officers tasked with identifying potential corruption and officer training issues at the ports, and some field offices use covert testing to assess and evaluate the integrity of personnel, technologies, policies, and procedures at the point of entry. For tests conducted from 2013 to 2018, OFO produced three comprehensive assessments related to tests it conducted in fiscal years 2012 through 2018. However, these assessments did not comprehensively analyze results of other types of covert tests conducted over this time period, including 72 fraudulent document and
The federal government plans to invest over $90 billion in IT in fiscal year 2019. However, GAO has previously reported that investments in federal IT have too often resulted in failed projects that incurred cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. GAO was asked to testify on the status of federal agencies' efforts to implement key IT management and cybersecurity initiatives. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which federal agencies have implemented GAO's prior recommendations to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations and (2) the status and progress of efforts to improve federal IT and strengthen cybersecurity. This statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from July 2011 through April 2019, with selected updates conducted in June 2019. To conduct these updates, GAE reviewed relevant laws, guidance, and other documents and interviewed officials from OMB, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and 24 selected federal agencies. In its March 2019 update to its high-risk series of reports on government-wide information technology (IT), GAO reported that agencies still needed to complete significant work related to the management and oversight of IT acquisition and operations. As of June 2019, OMB and agencies had fully implemented 768 (or 60 percent) of the 1,277 recommendations that GAO made since fiscal year 2010 to address shortcomings in these areas. For example, agencies need to ensure that Chief Information Officers (CIOs) review and approve all IT acquisitions, and that acquisition offices are involved in identifying and issuing related guidance and that IT acquisitions are reviewed in accordance with OMB guidance. Agencies also need to improve their management of software licenses to achieve cost savings. Of the 24 selected agencies GAO reviewed, only two had comprehensive policies that included the establishment of clear roles and central oversight authority for managing enterprise software license agreements, among other things. As a result, agencies' oversight of software license spending was limited or lacking, potentially leading to missed savings. In addition, the 24 agencies have not fully addressed the role of their CIOs in their policies for six IT management areas, including leadership and accountability, budgeting, information security, investment management, workforce, and strategic planning. In August 2018, in response to a GAO survey conducted for its report on federal IT management, most agency CIO identified five factors as being enablers to effectively carry out their responsibilities: NIST guidance, the CIO's position within the agency hierarchy, O MB guidance, coordination with the Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), and legal authority. Three factors were cited as major challenges: processes for hiring, recruiting, and retaining IT personnel; financial resources; and the availability of personnel/staff resources. Although OMB issued guidance aimed at addressing these three factors, the guidance did not fully do so. Further, regarding the financial resources challenge, its guidance required agencies to provide data on CIO authority over IT spending; however, it did not provide a complete definition of that authority. In the absence of such guidance, agencies created varying definitions of such authority. Until OMB updates its guidance, it will be difficult for OMB to identify deficiencies in this area and to help agencies make any needed improvements. In order to address challenges in implementing CIO responsibilities, in January 2018 GAO recommended that agencies ensure that their acquisition offices identify and review all of their IT contracts and that they are reviewed and approved by their chief information officers. Most agencies agreed with or had no comments on the recommendations, but none of the 27 recommendations had been implemented as of June 2018. In March 2018, the Administration issued the President's Management Agenda, which laid out a long-term vision for modernizing the federal government. The agenda identified three related drivers of transformation—IT modernization, data, accountability, and transparency, and the workforce of the future—that are intended to push change across the government. In particular, the Cross-Agency Priority goal on IT modernization stated that modern IT must function as the backbone of how government serves the public in the digital age.
Federal student aid can be an important resource available to help student parents pay for child care while enrolled in college, but only if students are aware of the option to increase federal student aid to help cover child care costs. GAO was asked to review student parents' access to child care. This report examines (1) the characteristics and degree completion of undergraduate students with dependent children, (2) what is known about the Child Care Access Means Parents in School grant program and how reliable Education's reported outcome information is, (3) student parent access to other key federal programs that help low-income families with child care, and (4) the extent to which selected schools that serve student parents publicize information about the student aid option to help pay for care. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from Education's National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) from the 2015-2016 school year, the most recent year available; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency documents; and interviewed officials from Education and three colleges and universities that received CCAMPIS grants. About 20 percent (4.3 million of 19.5 million) of all undergraduate students were parents, and many had characteristics Education has reported can affect their likelihood of staying enrolled in school and completing a degree, such as being a single parent and working full time. In addition, an estimated 52 percent of undergraduate student parents left school without a degree within 6 years, compared to 32 percent of students without children. About half of student parents had childcare expenses, in addition to their education and other living expenses, and an estimated 45 percent reported paying an average of about $490 per month in child care for a child age 5 or younger. About 60 percent of student students were enrolled in schools that did not offer on-campus childcare for students. The Department of Education (Education) reported that about 3,300 student parents at 85 schools received subsidized child care during the 2016-2017 school year. Grantees reported that there were more children on waiting lists to receive child care services (over 4,200) than the number of children served by the 85 schools (about 4,000). Most of the children were infants and toddlers (65 percent), according to grantee data. Education reported that it provided about $385 per month to subsidize the cost of child care at these schools for students who received a CCAMPis grant. In certain circumstances, a student parent may be eligible to receive additional federal student help to pay for paid child care by adding a dependent care allowance to their financial aid calculations. However, schools did not always publicize this option on their websites. About two-thirds of the college websites GAO reviewed (40 of 62) did not include information about this option in their websites as of December 2018. While schools are required to post certain college cost information and inform students about the availability of financial aid, they are not required to inform students of this option. Education's Federal Student Aid Handbook does not encourage schools to make this information readily available to students via school websites. Posting this information on school websites would make it more easily accessible to students, including prospective students who may not have access to publications located on campus. Education officials said that they could include language in the handbook encouraging schools to include this information as a best practice. Federal standards for internal control state that management should consider the availability and the extent of which information is readily available.
The 2017 hurricane season presented unprecedented challenges for mass care service providers, and for survivors in Florida, Puerto Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. GAO was asked to review the mass care response to the 2017 hurricanes. This report examines (1) how the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Red Cross (Red Cross) coordinated mass care after the hurricanes and (2) the extent to which FEMA collected key information on mass care capabilities prior to and during the hurricanes to aid in its response. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FEMA and Red Cross documents and interviewed officials from FEMA, the Red Cross, state and local government agencies, and voluntary organizations that provide mass care services, among other things. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its partners coordinated extensively during the 2017 Hurricanes, but some needs went unmet. For example, FEMA and the Red Red Cross established joint operation centers where they co-located with key partners such as the Salvation Army and National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD), which facilitated coordination of shelter, feeding, and supply distribution. However, officials from unaffiliated organizations, such as local advocacy groups and faith-based organizations, reported challenges sharing critical information regarding needs, resources, and capabilities with established mass care organizations. These coordination challenges affected their ability to provide services to certain populations, including low-income and migrant populations. Federal internal control standards emphasize the importance of communicating externally to key stakeholders. By not engaging in information sharing with unaffiliated groups, FEMA may miss opportunities to more accurately and efficiently coordinate mass care. FEMA did not collect key data on the capabilities of mass care partners prior to the hurricanes, and its updated approach to collecting these data has limitations. The reporting process at the time of the hurricanes did not require grantees to report specific estimates of their current capabilities for providing mass care, which resulted in an incomplete picture of capabilities. FEMA began revising its methodology for collecting capabilities assessment data in 2018, but it does not collect information that could better inform its mass care planning. FEMA does not specifically require that grantees solicit the input of key mass care providers in their capabilities assessments, even though mass care generally depends on the work of such organizations. FEMA's guidance encourages a whole-community approach in which grantees include community stakeholders and subject-matter experts in estimating capabilities. Without including key providers when estimating capabilities and naming them in their assessments, grantees and FEMA may not collect reliable mass care capability estimates, or know who to contact in response to a disaster. States and localities may not be able to efficiently allocate their own resources to areas of unmet need and may be more reliant on outside resources during disaster response, which could have implications for the allocation of federal resources. FEMA reviews grantees' capabilities assessments using standard checklists, but does not have a systematic process for providing feedback to grantees on their submissions in order to improve the usefulness of the information in them. FEMA officials use the checklists to assess the completeness and reasonableness of the submissions, but they vary in their approaches to following up with grantees when potential issues are identified, and FEMA has not provided them with written guidance to standardize this feedback process. FEMA has a strategic goal that involves supporting emergency managers in building the capacity to self- evaluate, monitoring the completion of improvement actions, and sharing insights. Providing feedback on the effective use of capability assessments as well as potential pitfalls may help grantees develop their capability assessments and inform plans to respond to disasters.
The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) CWMD administers the STC program, which provides funding to cities to develop nuclear or radiological detection capabilities. The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 2018 requires that CWMD develop a strategy and implementation plan for the program and a subsequent report assessing effectiveness and proposing changes. GAO was asked to review the program. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which DHS's CWMD tracks cities' use of program funds and assesses cities' performance in the program, (2) DHS's ability to ensure that cities can sustain capabilities gained through the program after program funding ends, and (3) how DHS has developed or documented potential changes to the program that would broaden its geographic reach and scope and how it plans to implement them. GAOs reviewed program documents and interviewed officials from CWMD, the FBI, and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). GAO also interviewed officials in five STC cities selected based on geographic diversity and other factors. DHS does not collect information to fully track cities' spending of STC funds for approved purposes and to assess cities' program performance. The extent of DHS's tracking is not consistent with federal internal control standards, which state that program management should design control activities to achieve objectives, such as comparing actual performance to planned or expected results and analyzing significant differences. For example, DHS tracks some spending and some performance data through quarterly reports it collects from cities, but does not track itemized expenditures and does not assess how effectively cities achieved key performance metrics and program milestones or how well they performed in exercises or drills that simulate a nuclear threat. By regularly collecting detailed information from cities on expenditures and comparing that information to approved purchase plans, CWMD would have greater assurance that cities spent funds as approved and that the expenditures are in keeping with program objectives. In addition, until CWMD requires cities to submit checklists or equivalent information on their progress, it will not have complete information on how cities are performing compared to the key performance measures and milestones they identified for themselves. Until CWMD more fully assesses performance by consistently enforcing requirements, as applicable, that cities report on how they performed during exercises, it cannot assess the extent of cities' ability to effectively detect or deter a nuclear and radiological threat. CWMD does not have assurance that Cities can sustain threat detection and deterrence capabilities and cities anticipate funding challenges once the program ends, even though encouraging sustainment is one of its primary program goals. Cities anticipate that funding challenges that will adversely affect their ability to sustain capabilities after the program's end. Specifically, GAO found that four cities submitted sustainment plans that did not identify how they would sustain capabilities once program funding ended, and three of the four submitted plans provided little detail about the specific equipment or training cities expect they will need after the end of program funding. Officials from all five cities raised concerns to GAO that they would not be able to maintain capabilities over time without a dedicated source of funding once funding ends. However, officials from the five cities told GAO they did not take steps to address these concerns because they viewed finding alternative sources of funding for sustainment as the cities' responsibility. DHS has not fully developed potential changes, including the basis for making changes, or documented their impact on current cities, and has not clearly communicated with the cities about how the changes will impact them. Without a clear basis for changes, it is unclear how proposed changes would align with program strategy and how CWMD will implement them, and without a clearly communicated plan, cities could face difficulties planning for the future.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for securing the nation's civil aviation system, which includes domestic and foreign air carrier operations to, from, within, or overflying the United States, as well as the foreign point-to-point operations of domestic air carriers. Air carriers are responsible for implementing TSA security requirements predominantly through TSA-approved security programs. These requirements for air carriers include, among other things, measures related to the screening of passengers, baggage, and cargo; training of employees in security and screening procedures; testing employee proficiency in screening; and access to aircraft. In addition, TSA may impose additional requirements in the form of security directives or emergency amendments when more immediate action on behalf of air carriers is necessary. GAO was asked to review TSA's oversight of air carrier security requirements. This report examines (1) the extent to which TSA has developed and implemented a process to update or cancel security directives and emergency amendments and (2) TSA's coordination with air carriers and other industry stakeholders when reviewing these directives. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials and representatives from air carriers, industry associations, and other stakeholders. TSA issued a management directive in 2012 and associated standard operating procedures in 2016 to guide the development and review of aviation security directives. TSA is to develop and review directives in accordance with steps identified in the TSA management directive, which include creating a team, developing a problem statement and options, drafting the policy document, and obtaining interoffice and management approval. The directive development process can take weeks if, for example, the directive is merely expanding the applicable locations from an existing directive, or several months, as was the case in the case of the broad-scoped worldwide directive regarding personal electronic devices and other international aviation security measures. Based on GAO's review of TSA documents, TSA has generally adhered to its internal process for updating or cancelling directives in the 43 reviews conducted from 2017 to March 2019. TSA officials stated that criteria for updating and canceling directives include whether the threat or vulnerability remains and whether the directive requires a change or could be canceled. However, TSA does not have a defined process for cancelling or incorporating directives into security programs, including expected time frames, and has not developed guidance on how to implement this process, as applicable. For example, TSA officials have not resolved how they will accomplish key steps in incorporating certain long-standing directives, such as a 2011 security directive pertaining to security measures for cargo from Yemen, into the security programs because not all air carriers transport cargo from that country. According to TSA officials, TSA's reorganizations, personnel changes, and limited staff availability have also delayed efforts to incorporate longstanding directives into the programs. TSA has not always canceled longstanding directives or incorporated them into air carrier safety programs. For instance, in 2012, TSA consolidated over 20 worldwide threat-based emergency amendments issued from 2001 to 2012 into one emergency amendment covering a number of different types of security measures with the plan to next incorporate it into the program, but since that time TSA has renewed the emergency amendment 13 times, each time with a new expiration date. TSA's standard operating procedure for security policy development, coordination, and issuance requires TSA officials to obtain input from key stakeholders and representatives of affected regulated parties (e.g., air carriers), as appropriate, but the procedures do not explain what “as appropriate” means. While TSA officials told GAO that they generally obtain mostly informal feedback from domestic carriers and their associations during quarterly meetings with industry or through air carriers' regular coordination with TSA international industry representatives, they did not document the input provided by air carriers during the directive review process. TSA requires that stakeholder and regulated party input be documented and includes the entity consulted, date, location, and a brief summary of the discussion and specific stakeholder input, to include any concerns. TSA did provide GAO with emails and appointments with associations and air carriers to obtain their input during revisions to the 2017 directives pertaining to international security measures, but this documentation did not capture a summary of discussions or stakeholder concerns. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that effective documentation assists in management's design of internal control by establishing and communicating who, what, when, where, and why ofinternal control execution to personnel. Documenting the input that air carriers provided would better ensure that TSA provides insight on shared air carrier views or concerns, and retains knowledge about who, why, where and why coordination occurred.
The four federal land management agencies—the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the National Park Service (NPS), and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)—are responsible for managing and protecting the lands and resources of the United States. GAO was asked to provide information on threats and assaults against land management agency employees. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing review of federal law enforcement data on threats, assaults, and other incidents against federal agency employees from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. It addresses (1) the extent to which the four agencies have completed facility security assessments on occupied federal facilities and (2) the types of threats and attacks against agency employees reported by law enforcement officials. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials from all four agencies. The four federal agencies GAO interviewed have completed some but not all of the facility security assessment requirements required by the Interagency Standard for Secure Federal Facilities (ISC Standard). For example, BLM has conducted 21 assessments on its approximately 280 occupied facilities, but officials do not know when they will complete the remaining assessments and do not have a plan to do so. The Forest Service has conducted at least 135 assessments of its approximately 1,135 occupied facilities. The Park Service has completed 148 assessments of about 1,505 occupied facilities but does not know how long it will take to complete all of these assessments and does not have an plan for doing so. FWS has conducted five assessments on about 465 occupied facilities; however, according to FWS headquarters officials, FWS employees have limited physical security expertise to conduct these assessments; therefore, the agency has developed a plan using contractors to meet the ISC Standard's requirement. The Department of the Interior's BLM and Forest Service have not yet established methodologies for conducting facility assessments, but BLM officials told GAO that they plan to hire a security manager who will develop an assessment methodology, and FWS officials provided a high-level description of what they expected to be included in their new methodology, but FWS's description did not indicate that the agency would evaluate the consequences of specific undesirable events, as required by ISC. Federal law enforcement reports show a range of threats, including attempted murder, assault, and threats conveyed over the telephone, against the employees of the four federal lands management agencies from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017. The severity of these incidents ranged from threats conveyed by the telephone to attempted murder and included an incident in which an employee was stabbed outside a federal building. The number of incidents of assaults and threats varied by agency, but the majority involved individuals motivated by anti-government ideologies. Further, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated under 100 domestic terrorism investigations into potential threats to federal land Management Agency employees from FY2013 through FY2017, and the majority of these investigations involved BLM. However, the number of actual threats and assault incidents is unclear and may be higher than what is represented in available data, because not all incidents are captured in the agencies' databases. Officials from two agencies said that when a single incident involved multiple offenses, the less serious offenses are unlikely to be recorded in the data system and the entirety of what occurred may not be captured. Land management agencies use various approaches to protect their employees, including deploying agency law enforcement officers to protect employees and resources and building relationships with external law enforcement entities and the public. Specifically, when necessary, agencies deploy additional law enforcement officer to assist their local officers. Agency officials told us that they also build relationships with local, state, or other federal agency officials to help protect employees in the field and to assist with coordinating law enforcement responses.
Criminal and terrorist organizations use TBML schemes to disguise the origins of their illicit proceeds and to fund their operations. TBML involves the misrepresentation of the price, quantity, or type of goods or services in trade transactions to conceal their illicit origins. The U.S. government has identified a number of countries around the world as being at risk for TBML, including Mexico, China, Colombia, the United Arab Emirates, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and the United Kingdom. GAO was asked to review TBML. This report examines (1) what the available evidence indicates about the types and extent of international TBML activities, (2) the practices selected international bodies have recommended for detecting and combating TBML and the potential challenges in implementing such practices, and (3) the extent to which the United States has effectively implemented the TTU program and the steps it has taken to collaborate with international partners to combat TB ML. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed relevant data and documentation from the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), State (State), and the Treasury (Treasury). GAO also interviewed knowledgeable sources in Washington, D.C., and in five countries selected on the basis of TBML risk and other factors, among other things. Different types of criminal and terrorist groups use a variety of money laundering schemes, but specific estimates of the amount of money laundered through TBML are not available, but available evidence suggests it is substantial and has increased in recent years. For example, drug trafficking organizations throughout Latin America, including in Colombia and Mexico, have used TBML to launder the proceeds from illegal drug sales for decades. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units (Egmont Group), the World Customs Organization (WCO), and others have identified TBML as a growing threat to international trade and commerce and have recommended various practices that countries could adopt to detect and combat it, such as sharing information and training for government agencies and private sector entities involved in international trade. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), within the Department of the Treasury, collects, analyzes, and disseminates the financial intelligence information it collects pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act and implementing anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, and works with other federal agencies and international bodies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, signed into law in 2016, addressed trade facilitation and trade enforcement issues such as import safety and the protection of intellectual property, among others, and addressed the prevention of the evasion of duties. In addition, Treasury's National Money Laundering Risk Assessment in 2015 and 2018 identified the money laundering threats and risks, including TB ML, which confront the UnitedStates. The Department of Justice's (DOI) Federal Bureau of Investigation's (DEA) Financial Crimes Division's (FCED) Criminal Division and the U. S. Attorney's Offices throughout the country prosecute cases involving money laundering crimes, including those involving TB ML schemes. In fiscal year 2018 alone, the DOJ estimated that TBML accounted for approximately $1.2 billion of the approximately $3.7 trillion in illicit financial flows in the United states, according to GAO's analysis of Treasury data. The Departments and agencies have taken steps to partner with partner countries to assist in combating TBml, but opportunities exist to enhance the effectiveness of the Trade Transparency Units (TTU) program. Under the program, HSI has set up TTUs in 17 partner countries. HSI's goal with the program is to exchange trade data with its partner TTUs to allow agencies in each country to work together to better identify anomalies in trade data that may indicate TBML that warrant further investigation. However, the program has faced several challenges, including a lack of funding for the program and a slow expansion of the program to other countries. For instance, in fiscal year 2013, State officials reported that State has not provided any funding to the program since 2013, because insufficient evidence of its effectiveness and various programming obstacles have led the department to prioritize funding for other crime prevention programs over the program. In the absence of a strategy and performance monitoring framework, however, DHS does not have a means of systematically tracking progress toward program goals and identifying areas that need adjustments to improve program results. Without such a strategy
The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 created FirstNet as an independent authority charged with establishing a nationwide public-safety broadband network that would, among other things, be deployed in phases that included substantial coverage milestones in rural areas. AT&T is the network's prime contractor and is required to meet certain milestones to receive payment for deploying the network, including meeting the first nationwide coverage milestone in March 2019. GAO was asked to review FirstNet's implementation of the network. This report examines the extent to which (1) AT& T is meeting the established milestones for the nationwide network deployment, including coverage and adoption goals, via its contract with FirstNet and (2) FirstNet is overseeing the deployment in accordance with key practices for contract oversight. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FirstNet contract documents, interviewed FirstNet officials, and conducted interviews with state, local, and tribal officials and first responders from a nongeneralizable sample of seven states selected based on geographic diversity and other factors. The results of these interviews are not generalizable to all FirstNet stakeholders or the network as a whole. The contract between the Department of Commerce's First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) and the telecommunications company (AT&T) provides for a 25-year, $6.5 billion partnership to deploy a nationwide broadband network for the nation's first responders (first responders) through a multi-phased approach through 2023. The network's full capabilities and functionality are only available via the Band 14 spectrum, which is reserved for public- safety use, and will not cover the entire U.S. at its expected final operating capability in 2023, when the network is expected to cover around 99 percent of the population. FirstNet has made progress in meeting the contract's coverage milestones and is on track to meet its adoption goals for the network by March 2020, according to FirstNet documentation. For example, as of July 2019, AT&C had delivered more than a third of the total expected Band 14 coverage in both non-rural and rural areas in the seven case-study states GAO examined. However, as GAO found in its analysis of FirstNet documents, progress toward meeting state-specific coverage commitments has varied across states. Specifically, among states in GAO's review, ATT's progress meeting the total coverage commitment ranged from approximately 20 percent complete in one state to nearly 100 percent in others. ATT is also on track for meeting its adoption goal of having a certain number of devices connected or subscribed onto the network (“ Device connections”) by the end of March 2020. First Net uses device connections as a proxy for adoption and has set or “forecasted” monthly targets that build up to the nationwide connections expected by March2020. GAE's analysis of the data provided by FirstNet indicates that ATT was at approximately 165 percent of its July 2019 target for device connections, with regard to primary users (law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services) and 106 percent for extended-primary users (e.g., transit agencies, public-utility and tow-truck companies, school districts, airports, and television- media news outlets). GAO also found that there is wide variance in where adoption is occurring. For instance, among case-studies states, device connections for primary users in some states were more than 5 times the target, whereas in another state, they were only 33 percent by July 2019. In addition, among the seven states, adoption by extended primary users also varied, with one state at 3 times its target compared to only 7 percent met in another. First net employs a variety of mechanisms to manage and oversee the deployment of its network and monitor contract performance. Many of these mechanisms align with key contract-oversight practices identified in federal acquisition regulations and other government, academic, and industry guidance on contract oversight, but some have weaknesses that limit their effectiveness. Specifically: FirstNet lacks a reliable master schedule to review and meaningful information on end-users' satisfaction to gauge performance quality. The master schedule does not reflect all of the work to be performed, precluding a comprehensive view of the entire program. The schedule also does not capture all government activities or cover the whole contract period, which can hamper program members' understanding of the complete plan. Additionally, the master schedule did not always have manageable or reasonable durations; for example, over 50 percent of remaining activities had
The Chetco Bar Fire began in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in Oregon on July 12, 2017, and burned over 191,000 acres through August 21, 2017. The fire burned in remote, steep terrain and rugged terrain and threatened more than 8,500 homes, according to the U.S. Forest Service. GAO was asked to review the fire. This report examines (1) key events of the fire and the Forest Service's response; (2) the fire's effects on local communities and resources; and (3) concerns raised about the response to the fire by Forest Service officials and stakeholders and any lessons learned that could be applied to future fires. GA O reviewed documents and interviewed Forest Service and other federal, state, tribal, and local officials, as well as other stakeholders, to identify key firefighting events and lessons learned from the fire that may be useful for future firefighting efforts. The Forest Service generally agreed with a draft of this report and provided a technical comment, which GAO incorporated. The Department of the Interior told GAO it had no comments on the draft report. Key events during the summer of 2017 included an unsuccessful initial firefighting attack and a rapid spread by strong, hot winds. In the initial phase (July 12-13, 2017), when the fire was relatively small and inaccessible, four Forest Service firefighters rappelled from a helicopter to create a helispot (a temporary helicopter landing area) on a ridge above the fire so that additional firefighters and equipment could more easily be brought to it. While the rappellers were working, a Forest Service helicopter returned to its base to drop water onto the fire, and two other helicopters dropped fire retardant to slow its spread. However, by July 13, the fire had grown to about 15 acres and the helicopter crew bosses for two crews that had been ordered the previous day flew over the fire early afternoon and observed a number of spot fires (smaller fires separate from the main fire) caused by burning material rolling down the hill. They expressed safety concerns about bringing crews into that area and also determined the helispOT needed more work before a helicopter could land safely. Since the crews would need to be shuttled in by helicopter, the crew bosses decided not to bring in the requested crews. Later that day, the incident commander requested that the eight Rappellers be removed because of safety concerns and a low probability of success at containing the fire (see figure). The fire grew slowly over several weeks as firefighters pursued indirect strategies (July 14-August 16, 2017). In the third phase (August 17-August 21), the fire expanded rapidly because of strong winds and dry, hot, dry conditions, which created conditions that led to extreme fire behavior. For example, in August 2017, CheTco Effect winds caused the fire to expand rapidly, in part because heavy vegetation on the south side of a river fueled the fire under the winds. Forest service officials and other stakeholders GAO interviewed and reports and other documents GAO reviewed identified a variety of effects the Chet co Bar Fire had on local community and resources, such as homes and infrastructure, public health, local businesses and workers, and natural and cultural resources. These effects can be grouped into four categories: (1). Effects on Homes and Infrastructure: The fire destroyed six homes, damaged one home, and threatened over 8,000 homes, causing more than 5,000 residents to be evacuated. Effects on Public Health: People with existing lung disease may not be able to breathe as deeply or vigorously as they normally would during exposure to high levels of particulate matter. Healthy people may also experience these effects. Local Businesses and Workers: Local businesses lost revenue in the short term because of decreased summer tourism and workers in the tourism and logging industries lost income because of wildfire smoke. Natural and Cultural Resources: Some cultural resources—including archaeological sites, historic structures, and areas significant to contemporary Native American tribes—were negatively affected by the fire but are likely to recover over time.
In 2008, the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a memorandum of understanding on nuclear energy cooperation, under which the two countries agreed to work together on a range of nuclear nonproliferation issues, including the development of a nuclear energy program. Since 2012, the U.S. government has been engaged in nuclear cooperation negotiations with Saudi Arabia to develop a new or amended agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation. GAO was asked to review the status of these negotiations. This report examines (1) the extent to which the Departments of State and Energy and the National Security Council (NSC) have informed Congress about the negotiations and any areas of disagreement, (2) U. S. agency management of the negotiations, and (3) the potential benefits and concerns that stakeholders have identified related to a nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Saudi Arabia. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials from State, NSC, DOE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). GAO also interviewed current and former congressional staff, and nuclear industry and nongovernmental experts who have followed the negotiations. The Department of State (State) and the Department of Energy (DOE) did not provide GAO with information on the status or details of the nuclear cooperation agreements they have negotiated with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia) since 2013. State officials told GAO that they consistently provided information to Congress on nuclear cooperation initiatives and other interactions with Saudi Arabian officials. However, State and DOE did not respond to GAO's requests for information on dates and related details of any congressional briefings related to the negotiations or other interactions between the agencies and Saudi officials. State provided a list of congressional briefings since 2013 but did not specify what was discussed. Based on this limited information, it is unclear whether the briefings by State kept Congress fully and currently informed of developments in the negotiations withSaudi Arabia, and congressional staff provided examples of having to find information on these negotiations from other sources, such as press articles. NNSA is a separately organized agency within DOE with responsibility for its nuclear weapons and nonproLiferation programs, among other things. State and NNSA have not made significant progress toward a nuclear cooperate agreement because of persistent differences between the parties over nonpro liferation conditions. The United States has been insisting that Saudi Arabia conclude an Additional Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and that it agree to restrictions on enrichment and reprocessing, but Saudi Arabia has expressed an unwillingness to do so, according to agency officials and other stakeholders GAO interviewed. Agency management of negotiations remains unclear with regard to agency roles and informing Congress. According to a State official and DOE officials, State would have “by definition” led any negotiations and without State present, any interactions between U.N. and Saudi official on nuclear cooperate with Saudi officials did not constitute negotiations. Agency roles remain unclear because DOE and State did not give GAO information to clarify or corroborate such roles. The AEA stipulates that State conduct any nuclear cooperate negotiations but does not define “negotiations.” According to one stakeholder, during an NSC meeting in late 2017, during which nuclear cooperation with SaudiSaudi was discussed, the NSC made a decision to reinforce established agency roles, including specifying that State would lead any negotiations. NSC did not confirm this decision, but GAO determined that representatives of each agency participated in the 2012 and March 2018 formal nuclear cooperation talks. In addition to the roles of State, DOE and NSC in nuclear negotiations, additional agencies such as Commerce, Commerce, DOD, and NRC are involved in matters related to international nuclear cooperation and the negotiation and conclusion of anuclear cooperation agreement. Stakeholders GAO contacted identified various potential non Proliferation Benefits and Concerns related to negotiating a nuclear cooperativeship with Saudi. For example, several stakeholders said that such an agreement would give the United states the opportunity to directly restrict Saudi Arabia's proliferation potential by, for example, prohibiting Saudi Arabia from separating plutonium accumulated in any reactor supplied under the agreement. Some stakeholders also said that it would be important for Saudi Arabia, if it were to acquire nuclear weapons, to address the questions regarding the country's stated intentions to develop nuclear weapons. Concerns also were raised about the potential for regional proliferation risks and undermining of global nonpro Liferation norms if Saudi Arabia develops a nuclear program.
The U.S.-flag fleet is increasingly facing challenges that threaten its ability to meet future defense needs. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have been directed to develop strategies to ensure the long-term viability of the fleet. In the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, Congress mandated that DOT develop a national sealift strategy and directed GAO to report on the strategy by February 2020. In August 2018, GAO issued a report that examined (1) DOT's progress in developing a national maritime strategy and (2) the challenges to ensuring that the fleet would continue to meet DOD's national defense needs and the options DOT has identified to address them. This testimony is based on GAO's August 2018 report and updates information from that report. To update information on the status of the maritime strategy, in January 2018 GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed MARAD and DOD officials. DOT has not yet finalized a National Maritime Strategy but plans to do so by the new February 2020 deadline. In 2014, Congress issued two separate mandates to DOT to develop national maritime strategies related to challenges facing the U. S.- flag fleet. The statutory deadline for the national sealsift strategy was extended from February 2015 to February 2020, and DOT has been working on a single draft maritime strategy to meet both mandates. DOT officials told GAO that they now plan to meet the new statutory deadline and issue the strategy in February 2020 and have identified various options to address it. Stakeholders GAO spoke with for its report identified two primary challenges to supporting the United States-flag fleet for defense needs, including maintaining its financial viability. First, according to MARAD officials, the relative cost of operating a U. s.-flag vessel compared to a foreign-flag vessel has increased in recent years, making it more challenging for vessel operators to remain economically viable under the U.-S. flag. Second, stakeholders identified a potential shortage of U.s.-citizen mariners available to crew the government-owned reserve fleet during a military activation as a challenge, in part due to the declining numbers of vessels that employ these mariners. GAO noted that DOT and the Maritime Administration (MARAD) officials had stated that they were not yet ready to address the feasibility of these options, or formally propose them. However, MARAD's administrator testified that MARAD is working with the Coast Guard and the maritime industry to better track licensed mariners who may no longer be sailing but could serve in a time of crisis, as recommended in a working group report. The working group's report also identified options to improve the accuracy of the count of available mariners, including developing a broad-based reserve program that would identify and support qualified mariners willing to sail in commercial and government vessels during an emergency. MARAD would provide limited financial assistance in training mariners and maintaining credentials, in turn for which those who participate would be obligated to sail.
This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's September 2018 report on the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Small Business Procurement Scorecard, which is used to assess federal agencies' progress toward small business procurement goals. GAO found that SBA has taken some steps to address recommendations GAO made in September 2018 to improve its Small Business procurement scorecard. However, as of May 2019, SBA had not provided documentation showing that it had completed these planned actions. In September 2018, GAO also found that the published fiscal year 2017 scorecards originally contained errors, including an incorrect grade and numeric score for one agency, and SBA does not have a process to ensure that scorecard results are published accurately. SBA officials said that errors occurred in the process of formatting scorecards for publication. Although SBA later corrected the errors, it did not initially document that scorecards had been changed, inconsistent with SBA's policy on information quality. Errors in the published scorecards--and the initial lack of disclosure about corrections--weaken data reliability and may undermine confidence in scorecard data. In October 2014, we recommended that SSA (1) design and implement a comprehensive evaluation to assess scorecard revisions and (2) institute a process for reviewing scorecard for accuracy prior to publication and a mechanism for disclosing corrected information. In July 2018, officials said they had begun developing a plan to evaluate the effects of the revised scorecard methodology but did not provide a draft plan. Conducting a well-designed and comprehensive evaluation could aid SBA in determining whether the scorecard is an effective tool for helping to achieve the agency's strategic goals. In March 2019, we reported on deficiencies in SBAs oversight of the Work Opportunity Zone Small Business (WOSB) program, including a lack of formal policies for reviewing the performance of its four approved third-party certifiers (private entities approved by SBA to certify the eligibility of WOSB firms), including their compliance with their agreements with the agency. We recommended that the Administrator of SBA establish comprehensive procedures to monitor and assess certifiers compliance with program requirements. While SBA took some steps in response to our recommendation, such as conducting a compliance review of the certifiers in 2016, in June 2018 SBA said it had no plans to conduct further compliance reviews until the final rule implementing the new certification process was completed. In addition, in March 2018, we found that although SBA adopted criteria and guidance for a risk-based approach to certifying and recertifying firms for the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) program in March 2017, the extent to which it conducted a risk assessment to inform its approach was unclear. As a result, we made recommendations to improve the HUBZone recertification process, which determines continued program eligibility every 3 years, in 2015 and 2017. In April 2018, the Administrator announced that it planned to update its internal policies and procedures for certifying firms to be eligible to participate in the program, but has not yet implemented these changes. In February 2018, in a follow-up review of a nongeneralizable sample of 12 firms in Puerto Rico that received HUB Zone certification between March 2017 and March 2018 that were not eligible for the program in 2017, we also found deficiencies in the oversight and implementation of the program. In a March 2019 report, we continued to find deficiencies related to the program and made recommendations aimed at improving program oversight, including the following: SBA should enhance its examination of businesses that register for the WOS B program to ensure only eligible businesses obtain set-asides. We found that about 3.5 percent of contracts using a WOSBside were awarded for ineligible goods or services from April 2011 through June 2018. We made a recommendation to SBA that it take actions such as completing the development of procedures to conduct annual eligibility examinations and implementing such procedures, analyzing examination results and individual businesses found to be ineligible to better understand the cause of the high rate of ineligibility in annual reviews and determine what actions are needed to address the causes, and implementing ongoing reviews of a sample of all businesses that have represented their eligibility to participate. In January 2019, in an effort to address our recommendation to improve oversight of its eligibility examinations, we issued a new report, which we updated in May 2019. We continue to believe that the implementation of sole-source authority in light of these continued deficiencies can increase program risk
In June 2018, DOD's Chief Management Officer established the Community Services Reform Task Force to perform a business case analysis to determine whether consolidating the four defense resale organizations would result in efficiencies. In November 2018, the task force recommended consolidating these organizations into a single organization and estimated that it would save between $690 million and $1.3 billion over the first 5 years and $390 million to $670 million annually thereafter. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's business case for consolidation. This report addresses (1) the extent to which DOD's analysis supports the consolidation, (2) whether the military departments concurred with the analysis, and (3) whether DOD's task force may have underestimated the expected costs of consolidation. GAO analyzed the business case, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed DOD officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) Business Case Analysis for Consolidating the Four Defense Resale Organizations GAO reviewed in November 2018 and August 2019 may not provide reliable savings and cost estimates for consolidation of the defense res sale organizations. The business case was conducted by a DOD task force that was appointed by the Chief Management Officers in June 2018. The task force estimated that consolidation would reduce the cost of goods sold in the commissaries and the exchanges by about 70 percent, resulting in estimated annual savings of between $329 million and about $517 million. However, GAO found that the estimated savings may be overstated because there is limited overlap in the products that DOD's Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) sells (i.e., groceries and household goods) and the products the exchange organizations sell (goods and services similar to retail stores). For example, about $2.2 billion of DeCA's costs in fiscal year 2017 were for products that were also sold by at least one of the three exchange organizations, which is equivalent to about 23 percent of the total cost for the four organizations. In addition, the estimated costs of IT systems development and headquarters relocation may be understated because they are based, in part, on less expensive minor upgrades and partial replacements, according to the resale organization data provided to GAO. The military departments agreed with the assessment, but did not concur with all aspects of the analysis. Specifically, the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and National Exchange Command expressed concerns about the analysis's use of proprietary industry benchmarks, estimated savings, costs, and timeline of consolidation, and proposed governance structure for the new organization. The Army and Navy also expressed concerns that morale, welfare, and recreation funding for the exchanges could be reduced or increased as a result of the consolidation. DOD did not include these concerns in its April 2019 report to Congress summarizing the results of its business case. DOD officials stated that they were advised by DOD's Office of General Counsel not to include them in the report because they contained information that may have disclosed DOD's deliberative process. Without a more complete reporting of these concerns and DOD's response to those comments, Congress may be unaware of the views various organizations within DOD have regarding the business cases analysis.
The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) required DOT to establish a finance bureau to coordinate and consolidate certain surface transportation funding and finance programs. The FAST Act also included a provision for GAO to review the Bureau's actions to establish procedures for evaluating applications for programs it administers and provide a clear rationale for major decisions in the application evaluation process. GAO assessed (1) the progress DOT made to establish the Bureau and carry out its responsibilities; (2) the Bureau’s process for evaluate applications and provide technical assistance, including obtaining the views of sponsors and stakeholders; and (3) whether the Bureau, when evaluating applications, has provided aclear rationale for its decisions. GA O reviewed Bureau documents and interviewed DOT and Bureau officials and selected project sponsors. The Department of Transportation (DOT) created the Build America Bureau (Bureau) in July 2016 to provide a single point of contact and coordination for project sponsors seeking to apply for financing programs and explore innovative financing for surface transportation projects. DOT established an organizational structure and created a consolidated process for the Bureau to use when working with project sponsors to evaluate applications for these programs. DOT also created a Council on Credit and Finance (Council) to review and make recommendations to the Secretary on applications for DOT's financing programs, regularly review projects that have received financing, and conduct other duties the Secretary establishes. The Council is mostly comprised of DOT political appointees, including the Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Under Secretary for Policy, and Administrators of the Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Highway Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration. DOT created the Bureau in 2015 to consolidate and improve the process for evaluating and providing technical assistance to project sponsors applying for financing and financing programs under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) and Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) programs, which provide billions of dollars in direct loans and other forms of credit assistance to transportation projects of national or regional significance. In addition, DOT established the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) grants program, which provides $4.5 billion in discretionary grants for nationally significant freight and highway projects for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 to states and local governments that meet certain requirements. DOT has made some progress in establishing the Bureau. For example, DOT created an initial implementation plan and created two offices within the Bureau that generally aligned with the plan. However, the Bureau has made limited progress on its other responsibilities, such as promoting innovative-financing best practices for certain types of projects. The Bureau also lacks a plan to guide its ongoing and future efforts and has not established performance indicators to measure its outcomes and assess progress. Federal standards for internal control and key practices for organizational transformations stress the importance of setting measurable objectives and developing performance measures to assess progress, but the Bureau does not have such a plan. Sponsors GAO interviewed had a generally positive experience with the application process for TIFIA and RRIF and identified challenges with the process, including uncertainty related to the overall length and uncertainty of the process and unclear goals and risk appetite for the programs. Bureau officials identified limitations to providing more certainty to sponsors for each of these challenges and noted that the Bureau cannot control all the factors and circumstances surrounding the process. Federal internal control standards call for management to internally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve its objectives; this communication includes providing management quality information that is necessary for effective oversight. In response to congressional direction to make changes to streamline the application review process for DOTs financing programs to accept and evaluate applications, thebuild America Bureau created a new consolidated process to review applications. The new process combined the various review processes previously used by three separate offices to administer the three financing programsTifIA, RRIF, and PABto administer the programs, respectively. In creating this consolidated process, DOT sought to improve and streamline this process, as called for in the FAST act. For the PAB program, DOT also consolidated some of its existing processes for reviewing applications, but has not developed an approach to examine whether opportunities for further streamlining and improvement exist. Without examining its process and communicating its appetite for risk, the bureau may be missing an opportunity to address challenges that may undermine the purpose and availability of its programs.
The federal government relies on the public to submit comments on proposed regulations through Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites, such as the Federal Register, to help ensure that the public has a voice in the rulemaking process. GAO was asked to provide information on the extent to which selected agencies (1) collect identity information from commenters and accept anonymous comments, (2) have internal guidance associated with the identity of commenters during the public comment process, and (3) document and communicate their posting practices to public users of the websites. This testimony is based on GAO's June 2019 report, GAO-2019-10-854 . GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials at 10 selected agencies to determine how these agencies collect and process identity information and how they use it during the comment process. Consistent with the discretion afforded by the Administrative Policy Act of 1974 (APA), the selected agencies use required and optional fields on comment forms to collect some identity data from commenters. In addition to the text of the comment, agencies may choose to collect identity data by requiring commenters to fill in other fields such as name, address, and email address before they are able to submit a comment. Regardless of the fields required by the comment form, the agencies all accept Anonymous comments in practice. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), among others, allow commenters to submit an anonymous comment through regulations.gov. However, these links go directly to comment files, and do not link to the agency's own website. While the APA does not include requirements for commenters to provide identity information, key practices for transparently reporting open government data state that federal government websites should fully describe the data that are made available to the public, including by disclosing data sources and limitations. The selected agencies do not effectively communicate the limitations and inconsistencies in how they post identity information associated with public comments. As a result, public users lack information related to data availability and limitations that could affect their ability to use and make informed decisions about the comment data and effectively participate in the rulesmaking process themselves. Seven of the 10 agencies GAO examined have documented some internal guidance that is associated with commenters' identity during the three phases of the public comments process: intake, analysis, and response to comments. However the focus and substance of this guidance varies by agency and phase of the comments process. For selected agencies that have guidance that relates to commenters' identities, the guidance most frequently relates to the comment intake or response to comment phases. The guidance for these phases addresses activities such as managing duplicate comments (those with identical or near-identical comment text but varied identity information) or referring to commenters in a final rule. Agencies are not required to develop internal guidance on identity information generally, or identity information specifically. The 10 agencies varied in their treatment of identity information during the intake phase, particularly in terms of how they identify duplicate comments and post comments, which can lead to identity information being inconsistently presented to public user of comment systems. Specifically, the variation in how agencies identify and post duplicate comments during the review and comment process results in the presentation of duplicate comment information inconsistently on the websites of these agencies. The lack of accompanying disclosures may potentially lead users to assume, for example, that only one entity has weighed in on an issue when, actually, that comment represents 500 comments. Without better information about the posting process, the inconsistency in the way in which duplicate comments are presented to users limits public users' ability to explore and use the data and could lead them to draw inaccurate conclusions about the comments that were submitted.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides health care services to veterans and other eligible beneficiaries through several community care programs, including the Veterans Choice Program, which allows eligible veterans to obtain health care from community providers when they face long wait times or travel long distances for appointments at VA medical facilities. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (VA MISSION Act) requires GAO to review VA's community care program. GAO was asked to review community care for veterans. This report examines (1) VA's obligations for community care and the number of veterans authorized to use community care from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, (2) how VA developed its community care budget estimate for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, and (3) the extent to which VA's actual community care obligations were higher than estimated in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed VA budget justification data, reviewed relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed VA officials. VA and OMB reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. VA obligated $13.6 billion in community care in fiscal year 2017 and $14.9 billion in 2018—amounts that were $1.2 billion and $2 billion higher, respectively, than what VA originally estimated for its budget request, and what VA received in its annual appropriation—and estimates that obligations will increase to $17.8 billion by fiscal year 2021, which VA officials said is attributable, in part, to the new eligibility criteria under the VA Mmission Act. In addition, VA's higher-than-estimated obligations included additional Choice Program funding that VA requested and received outside of the annual appropriations process. VA also reallocated funding from other sources, including unobligated funding from a prior fiscal year and collections, to pay for other community care services. In fiscal year 2018, VA updated its Enterprise Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) to estimate the amount of resources needed to purchase a set of more than 40 health services that have accounted for over 75 percent of VA's total community care costs. For the remainder of these services, VA used other methods to develop budget estimates, such as projections of the unit cost of providing one day of care, that were used historically to develop estimates of the resources needed for the state home per diem program and benefit programs. Beginning with the President's fiscal year (FY) 2018 budget request for VA, VA also updated its EHCPM to estimate most of its FY 2019 budget estimate. For FY 2019, VA expects to spend $12.4 billion on community care, an increase of about $1 billion over the FY 2019 estimate. In FY 2017 and FY 2018, actual obligations for VA community care were higher for both the Choice Program and other programs than estimated. For example, in FY 2017, VA obligated more than $2.3 billion for outpatient services and $818 million for inpatient services, while in FY 2018 obligations for outpatient and inpatient care were both higher. In both years, VA transferred a portion of its overall collections from its Medical Care Collections Fund to the medical community care account. VA estimated that from FY 2019 through FY 2021, obligations for the Veterans Community Care Program—which is expected to go into effect by June 2019—will increase by about $3 billion. The authority for VA's Choice Program ends June 6, 2019, after which the new program will be expected to begin. For comparison purposes, the largest increase in obligations for services provided at VA facilities is estimated to occur between FY 2020 and 2021. VA data on authorizations forCommunity Care GAO's analysis of VA data for FY 2014 through FY 2018 shows that the number and utilization of community care increased about 40 percent. The approximately 1.8 million veterans authorized for care in 2018 represented about 30 percent of all veterans accessing VA health care in that year (approximately 6.2 million veterans). VA officials told GAO that they estimate that by FY 2021 at least 1.9 million veterans will still be authorized to access community care. After being authorized, veterans' utilization of certain services increased by more than 200 percent, especially chiropractic visits (418 percent), physical therapy visits (252 percent), and non-mental health related office visits (243 percent). GAO analysis of data included in VA's budget justifications for FY 2018 and FY 2019 shows relatively smaller increases in veteran utilization for certain inpatient and outpatient services.
Promoting respect for human rights is a goal of U.S. foreign policy. The United States considers the advancement of human rights when providing security assistance to foreign countries. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State (State) share responsibility for developing policy for, managing, and implementing human rights training for foreign security forces. GAO was asked to review DOD's and State's efforts to provide such training. This report (1) describes the entities through which DOD and State provide training on human rights and international humanitarian law; (2) assesses the extent to which they track the provision of and funding for the training; and (3) examines the extent that DOD and state have evaluated the effectiveness of the training. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed laws, guidance, budget documents, course catalogs, and agency data; interviewed agency officials; and conducted site visits at three facilities that provide human rights-related training. DOD incorporates human rights education and training as part of a wide range of assistance programs that involve a number of DOD entities in different capacities. For example, the Defense Institute of International Legal Studies (DIILS) is DOD's lead resource for providing legal education and rule of law engagement training to foreign military personnel and civilian defense officials. The Center for Civil–Military Relations (CCMR) is a DOD organization within the Naval Postgraduate School that focuses on civil-military relations and provides in-residence programs and mobile education training. The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) provides professional training and education for military and law enforcement personnel from countries in the Western Hemisphere. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) is the DOD entity with oversight responsibilities for ensuring that DIILS-provided training is provided as appropriate. DOD does not systematically track all human rights–related training in DOD systems. As a result, DOD officials noted they were unaware of the full scope of the agency's human rightstraining. DOD officials said it is challenging to track training because many courses and training activities might include human rights content. While DOD is not required to track all such training, DOD has systems in place intended to track the training mandated by Section 333 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for security assistance programs. However, limitations in the implementation of this system have led to questions about the completeness of the data. DOD is developing an approach for monitoring and evaluating its security assistance activities, but has not established a timeline for evaluating human rights Training for Foreign Security Forces. The 2017 NDAA, enacted in December 2016, requires DOD to conduct assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (M&E) of its security cooperation programs and activities. DOD has begun to develop a new M&E approach for DOD's security assistance, but it has not yet established a time frame for evaluating its human rights programs. According to State officials, State's Bureau of Political–Military Affairs (PM) is in the initial phase of developing its evaluation plan for its programs, including the International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEA) program, which is a major component of training provided to foreign law enforcement entities. State does not have a plan, with a clear timeline, with which to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of human Rights Training provided under IMET. State's January 2018 Guidance for the Design, Monitoring and Evaluation Policy at State states that it is essential that bureaus and independent offices have comprehensive plans for evaluating all their programs and projects, and the plans should include, among other things, an implementation schedule. Such a plan with a timeline would better position State and DOD to identify areas for improvement and provide other important stakeholders, including Congress, with evidence to better inform decisions about U. S.-funded human rightsTraining provided under the International Military Education and Training program.
Hurricanes Irma and Harvey in 2017 caused widespread damage in Florida and Texas, with more than $10 billion in flood insurance claims in those states. NFIP is the federal government's primary program for flood insurance, which provides property owners with flood insurance to protect their homes and businesses from flood damage. FEMA relies on communities participating in NFIP to implement its floodplain management requirements, which are designed to reduce the risk of flood damage and the resulting cost to taxpayers. GAO was asked to review communities' implementation of NFIP requirements. This report (1) describes the requirements that communities must meet and the challenges they face in doing so, (2) examines the extent to which FEMA uses community visits to ensure communities follow requirements, and (3) examines how FEMA oversees community implementation of requirements for conducting substantial damage assessments. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data on community assistance visits conducted by FEMA from 2008 through 2019, reviewed FEMA policies and guidance, and interviewed FEMA and community officials. Communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) must meet certain requirements to participate in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration's (NEMA) National Floodplain Management Program. Communities must join NFIP for their residents to purchase flood insurance through the program. To join, communities must adopt and enforce FEMA-approved building standards to reduce future flood damage, and they must also meet certain management requirements to reduce flood risk, such as establishing base flood elevations, or the elevation at which FEMA anticipates floodwater will rise during a flood, and requiring permits for all development in special flood hazard areas. FEMA's primary tool for ensuring that communities implement NFIP's requirements is the community assistance visit. These visits are intended to help FEMA prevent, identify, and mitigate deficiencies in communities' management of floodplain areas. However, FEMA's oversight is hindered by limited community visits and incomplete data on the results of these visits. For example, about one-third of all records from 2008 to 2019 remained open for a year or longer, and in some cases records stayed open for 5 years or more. As a result, FEMA cannot readily determine if open records indicate a recordkeeping problem, a community deficiency that needs to be addressed, or something else. In addition, FEMA does not have ready access to data on substantially damaged properties and the related documentation, which hinders its ability to determine if an NFIP community has followed NFIP substantial damage assessment procedures and correctly identified all substantially damaged homes. FEMA also has not clarified how communities can access NFIP claims data that could help them after a flood. FEMA officials acknowledged confusion among communities concerning their access to these data and said they have been working to address it, noting that they must ensure compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, under which the agency can share certain data only with organizations that have a programmatic need for the information. While FEMA has taken positive steps toward reducing confusion surrounding communities' access to claims data, at the time of GAO's review FEMA had not yet finalized new guidance. Federal standards for internal control state that management should externally communicate necessary quality information to achieve the agency's objectives and address related risks. Until FEMA clarifies the process for communities to access claims data on properties within their community, FEMA may be missing an opportunity to provide communities with data that they would find helpful in the substantial damage process.
Public companies are required to disclose information on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, such as climate change, in their annual 10-K filings and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ESG factors can affect a company's expected financial performance and thereby its value to shareholders. While federal securities laws generally do not specifically address the disclosure of ESG information, SEC's Regulation S-K's disclosure requirements for nonfinancial information apply to material ESG topics. GAO was asked to review ESG disclosures. This report examines (1) why and how investors have sought additional ESG disclosure information, (2) how public companies' disclosures of selected ESG issues have compared within and across industries, (3) steps SEC staff have taken to assess the effectiveness of the agency's efforts to review these disclosures, and (4) the advantages and disadvantages of policy options that investors and market observers have proposed to improve disclosures. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 32 large and mid-sized public companies in eight industries that were among the eight largest in terms of market capitalization and, when taken together, represented a diverse range of industry sectors. These companies were selected based on factors frequently cited by market observers as important to investors or potentially material for companies in several industries, among other factors. To obtain information about the extent to which investors have used shareholder proposals to promote improved ESg disclosures, we analyzed proposals submitted to a stratified random sample of 100 companies listed as of October 4, 2019, on the S&P Composite 1500, which combines three indices—S&P 500, MidCap 400, and SmallCap 600. The information collected from this sample of institutional investors cannot be generalized to the larger population of all institutional investors. Institutional investors are public and private entities that pool funds on behalf of others and invest the funds in securities and other investment assets. Most large institutional investors with whom GAO spoke said they seek ESG-related information from public companies to enhance their understanding of risks that could affect companies' value over time. Most investors said they engage with companies to address gaps or inconsistencies in ESG data that limit their usefulness. For example, most investors said that gaps in narrative disclosures limited their ability to understand companies' strategies for considering ESG risks and opportunities. To a limited degree, some investors seek additional disclosures by submitting shareholder proposals, which are requests from shareholders that the company take action on a specific issue or issues. Most of the public companies GAO interviewed said they considered legal and regulatory requirements and stakeholder input and conducted some form of stakeholder engagement when deciding which ESG topic to disclose. However, some institutional investors, companies, and others with whom we spoke have recommended private-sector approaches to improve companies' ESG reporting. These approaches could include industry-developed frameworks and stock exchange listing requirements. Some market observers recommended that SEC issue new rules requiring issue-specific ESG Disclosure Rulemaking. SEC has taken steps to consider these types of disclosure requirements, including a proposed rule in August 2019 on human capital resources and management. SEC staff generally use a principles-based approach to overseeing public companies disclosures of non financial information, including information on ESGs. Under this approach, SEC staff rely primarily on companies to determine what information is material and requires disclosure in their SEC filings. SEC officials noted that companies are ultimately responsible for the disclosures they provide to investors, and they have liability for their disclosures under federal and state securities laws. In a January 2020 statement that addressed climate change and environmental disclosures, the SEC Chairman reiterated his view that SECs approach to disclosure on these topics should continue to be rooted in materiality, including providing investors with insight regarding the company’s assessments and plans for addressing material risks to its business operations.
FAMS is responsible for deploying air marshals to meet the nation's aviation security needs. Air marshals are deployed worldwide to protect civil aviation against the risk of terrorist violence. GAO was asked to review FAMS's workforce. This report examines (1) the extent to which FAMS has taken steps to address air marshal health concerns, (2) the degree to which it has addressed air marshall concerns about their work schedules, and (3) what is known about the number of discrimination complaints FAMS employees have reported to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS). GAO reviewed FAMS policies and procedures, interviewed FAMS management and staff, and analyzed data from fiscal years 2016 through 2018 on the number and characteristics of FAMS employee discrimination complaints, the most recent full year of data available at the time of GAO's review, and results of the Office of Personnel Management's 2018 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) for FAMS, TSA, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees in 2018—the most recent data available in 2018. Air Marshals in all six FAMS field offices GAO visited stated that health issues are a key quality of life concern. The most common health issues raised in discussion sessions with GAO were extreme fatigue, mental health issues, difficulty maintaining a healthy diet, and increased frequency of illness. In addition, OPM's FEVS survey asked employees whether they "believe they are protected from health and safety hazards." DHS estimates that in fiscal year 2018, less than half (44 percent) of FAMS employees believed they were protected from such hazards. FAMS officials stated that they plan to create a working group to identify options to monitor the health of the workforce as a whole. However, they did not provide any timeframes or documentation of this effort. Without information on the overall health and fitness of the FAMS workforce, FAMS is not well positioned to prioritize employee health and welfare or ensure that it deploys a workforce capable of fulfilling its national security mission. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a professional association representing federal law enforcement officers, including air marshages, stated that schedule unpredictability—short-notice changes to their start times, missions, and at-home days—was a keyquality of life issue. In response to this unpredictability, in 2018 FAMS expanded to multiple standby shifts per day with staggered start times and modified standby shift start times. Fams has taken some steps to mitigate the impacts of these changes, but has not monitored work hours against guidelines or made them available to employees. For example, GAO found that the average domestic mission shift length for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was between 6.5 and 7.5 hours, which is below the 10-hour scheduling guideline for domestic mission shifts, but was less than the 15-hour guideline for international mission shifts that include an overnight layover. As a result, the agency may not be able to successfully manage risks of potentially decreased alertness and focus when air Marshals perform their duties. Further, although FAMS does not monitor actual work hours to determine if air marshers' work hours are consistent with scheduling guidelines, it has not shared scheduling guidelines or provided guidance outlining authorities and procedures for changing work hours with field offices, which would improve the ability of air marshALs and their supervisors to address quality-of-life issues related to long shifts and inadequate rest. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should implement control activities through policies by, for example, communicating to personnel the policies so that they can implement the control activities for their assigned responsibilities. Providing field office supervisors with written information on their roles and authorities would provide clarity for air marshalls, who GAO identified as being uncertain about their authorities in this regard. From fiscal year 2016 to 2018, employees in FAMS filed 230 equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints with TSA's Civil Rights Division (CRD), though employees may have reported additional discrimination complaints through other means. As such, the 230 EEO complaints may underestimate the total number of incidents of alleged discrimination within FAMS. TSA and FAMS have taken some but not all planned steps to prevent discrimination. Consistent with FAMS' 2012 plan, DHS and TSA have provided EEO and diversity training to employees and offered forums for air Marshal's to raise concerns about discrimination. F AMS has not fully implemented or maintained these efforts
VA is responsible for providing benefits to veterans, including health care, disability compensation, and various types of financial assistance. Since 2015, GAO has designated VA health care as a high-risk area, in part because of concerns about VA's management and oversight of the services it provides to veterans. GAO designated VA's disability programs as high risk in 2003, and in 2015 expanded this area to include health care in 2015. In 2017, VA was also added to GAO's High-Risk List for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) due to concerns about its ability to manage risks and improve its health care services. In 2018, VA received a total budget of $201.1 billion for fiscal year 2019, the largest discretionary budget in its history. This testimony focuses on VA's efforts to address its high- risk designation for managing risks and improving health care. It is based on GAO reports and testimonies issued from 2015 through 2019 related to VA's health care operations, including selected updates conducted in March 2019 on the status of recommendations GAO made in 2017 and 2018. Since GAO first designated VA’s health care system as high- Risk in 2015, the department has taken steps to address each of the identified five areas of concern related to managing risks. These five areas are (1) ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes; (2) inadequate oversight and accountability; (3) IT challenges; (4) inadequate training for VA staff; (5) unclear resource needs and allocation priorities; (6) workload challenges; and (7) a lack of reliable data systems. As of March 2019, ratings for all five criteria remain unchanged for this area of concern for VA. Specifically, the leadership commitment and action plan criteria remain partially met. Although VA has experienced leadership instability over the past 2 years in several senior positions, a new Secretary was confirmed in July 2018. Secretary Wilkie has demonstrated his commitment to addressing the department's high risk designation by, among other things, creating an office to direct an integrated, focused high risk approach and communicating to VA leaders the importance of addressing GAO recommendations and working with GAO. The Secretary's actions, to date, have allowed the department to maintain its leadership commitment rating as of March 2018. VA has launched several significant efforts, including transforming its electronic health record and financial management systems, updating its medical surgical prime program, and implementing the VA MISSION Act. Any one of these efforts would be a significant undertaking for an agency given their scope, time frames, and costs, and VA is attempting to concurrently implement them. If successful, these efforts could be transformative for the department. Sustained congressional oversight of VA's modernization efforts will be needed to ensure that the modernization efforts integrate and address many of the concerns that led to the designation of various VA areas as high risks. In March 2018, the Secretary submitted an action plan to address the underlying causes of its high risks, but the plan did not clearly link actions to stated outcomes and goals or establish a framework to assess VA's progress. VA officials told GAO that instead of revising the March 2018 action plan, it will incorporate its plans to address these areas into current initiatives.
In recent years, wireless carriers have deployed a new generation of technology, known as 5G, which allows for enhanced mobile broadband, offering greater speed and higher data capacity than previous generations of mobile wireless networks. Carriers are currently deploying 5G as “hybrid” 5G networks, which use 5G technologies in combination with existing 4G networks to improve the networks' speed by enhancing the technology that connects a user device to a core network. In the future, carriers that want to deploy 5G will have to replace their existing 4Gs with new 5G equipment to enhance the core networks. GAO was asked to review issues related to 5G deployment. This report examines the challenges, and the federal government's efforts, related to (1) managing spectrum; (2) closing the digital divide; and (3) addressing economic issues. To address these objectives, GAO convened a meeting of experts from academia, industry, and consumer and industry groups, and interviewed officials from FCC, NTIA, and other federal agencies. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lacks comprehensive strategic planning to guide its spectrum policy for 5G. FCC has taken a number of actions, such as issuing an order approving a merger between two mobile carriers that included certain service requirements to increase 5G access nationwide, but it has not clearly developed specific and measurable performance goals and related strategies and measures to manage the spectrum demands associated with 5G deployments. For example, FCC's strategic plan for 2018 through 2022 includes a strategic goal and performance goals to close the "digital divide," but the performance goals are not specific or measurable. Further, neither the strategic plan nor the 5G Fast and Standardized Standardized Deployment Plan (5G FAST Plan) include specific performance measures regarding the effects of 5G on theDigital divide. These omissions are contrary to leading practices of results-oriented organizations identified in previous GAO work. FCC officials said that they are focusing on reducing the Digital divide and have set high-level goals, but have not established goals specific to 5Gs. However, by establishing specific performance goals for 5Gs, FCC will have greater assurance that it has properly planned actions to effectively address the likely adverse effects on the Digital Divide as 5Gs are deployed. Experts told GAO that deploying 5Gs will be very costly for carriers. To support all the new capabilities of 5g networks, carriers will need to replace 4G core networks with new equipment to provide new capabilities such as ultra-reliable low latency communications that could enable the development of new, more advanced use cases. Experts noted that carriers may not currently have the capital required to fund large-scale deployments of 5Gs due, in part, to the costs of recent business decisions. Additionally, consumers are not always willing to pay more for 5g service, which reduces carriers' ability to recoup their deployment investments. The challenge for some households to afford the most advanced mobile communications services would become worse if carriers charge more for these services.
The Department of Energy's (DOE) Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) at Hanford, Washington, is to treat about 54 million gallons of radioactive and hazardous waste from the production of plutonium at the Hanford Site in 177 underground tanks. The WTP is the largest construction project within DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM), which has spent over $11 billion and nearly 20 years to design and build the facility. In 2012, construction of the pretreatment facility was suspended because of technical challenges. GAO was asked to review the WTP. This report examines (1) the cost of pretreatment efforts from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2018 and the status of the Pretreatment Facility, (2) technical challenges facing the facility, and (3) the steps EM is taking to begin treating waste by 2023 as required and the extent to which EM has engaged with regulators. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed DOE and contractor officials. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, DOE spent about $752 million to maintain the partially constructed Hanford Waste Treatment Facility (the WTP) and resolve technical challenges, but design and construction on the Pret Treatment Facility remains on hold. Over half of this funding went toward overhead, oversight, and other costs, such as facility maintenance. The remaining funds went toward resolving technical challenges that led to the suspension of construction. In fiscal year 2019, Bechtel National, Inc. (BNI), the prime contractor for WTP, allocated $1.5 billion in overhead costs to the facility that had previously been recorded in non-facility specific accounts. In June 2019, BNI also applied this change to pre-2015 costs, which brings BNI's total pret treatment facility costs, from the beginning of the contract in December 2000 through July 2019, to $3.4 billion, of which $1 billion is overhead costs. According to EM officials, EM does not have plans to complete a cost estimate for completing the facility and has no plans to develop such an estimate in the near future. EM and BNI have been working since 2012 to address the longstanding technical challenges associated with the construction and design of thepretreatment facility. EM reported that the technical challenges have been resolved, but EM has not yet designed or engineered the solutions. In addition, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB), which provides independent advice and recommendations to the Secretary of Energy regarding the protection of public health and safety at DOE's defense nuclear facilities, does not consider these technical challenges to be resolved yet, though it continues to review EM's efforts. As a result of this significant engineering work still ahead, as GAO reported in May 2015, EM likely will have to conduct rework of the existing facility (which is 40 percent built), leading to further cost increases and schedule delays. As of December 2019, DNFSB had officially commented on one of EM's proposed solutions—related to technical challenges surrounding the pulse-jet mixers—and noted simply that EM's work “strengthens the technical foundation” for using the mixers and that it would “continue to follow the design process.” With regard to the remaining challenges, officials said that for some, additional deficiencies needed to be addressed. For others, they said they were reviewing the details of EM’s proposed solution or needed additional information from EM. For two of the categories of technical issues, DN FSB officials said they considered them to be operational rather than safety issues and therefore they would not review EMs proposed solutions. To begin treating hazardous waste, EM began analyzing alternatives for treating high-level waste (HLW) in April 2019 and plans to report its findings in September 2020. However, as of February 2020, EM had not yet met two key steps in its analysis of alternatives that are among the best practices GAO identified for an AOA process—defining mission need and developing life-cycle cost estimates for the baseline alternative—as called for in DOE guidance. For example, EM did not define the mission need for the analysis or develop a reliable life- cycle cost estimate of the alternatives it analyzed prior to selecting its preferred alternative. As such, it is unclear if or how EM will be able to compare the alternative it is analyzing for HLW treatment to the other alternatives and determine a risk-informed, cost-effective path forward for treating HLW.
DHS is the third largest U.S. government department, with more than 200,000 employees and an annual budget of more than $50 billion. GAO was asked to review DHS's EEO program. In 2009, GAO reported that DHS had not fully addressed barriers to employment for women and minorities in its workforce and recommended that DHS identify and address such barriers. In fiscal years 2014 through 2017, DHS reported that it had a combined total of 4,229 compliance measures for its EEO programs, which included a total of 128 self-identified deficiencies. EEOC requires agencies to demonstrate meaningful progress toward the removal of deficiencies and to develop action plans for how they will attain the essential elements of a model program. This report examines, among other things, (1) DHS's progress in identifying and addressing identified EEO barriers and (2) the extent to which DHS and its components have taken steps to address identified barriers and identified deficiencies in their EEO efforts. To do this work, GA O reviewed DHS's MD-715 reports and EEOC guidance, and interviewed DHS officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified workforce demographic data anomalies that indicate potential barriers to equal opportunity (EEO) within its workforce, but has not yet developed performance metrics to measure its progress in eliminating identified barriers. For example, in its fiscal year 2017 report, DHS identified three department-wide triggers: high rate of nonretirement separations for certain groups, particularly white women; low participation rates of women and various ethnic and racial groups in the permanent workforce; and low participation rate of individuals with disabilities and targeted disabilities. In addition, DHS's Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) has lead responsibility for implementing a multiyear plan for targeted recruitment of applicants from identified underrepresented groups. OCHCO completed its initial plan in 2012 and is to annually update its established goals for intern programs, job fairs, and local advertising. DHS reported some improvements in employee engagement and representation of minorities and women, but does not have performance metrics for tracking progress towards eliminating barriers. DHS's employee engagement increased from 54 percent in 2014 to 60 percent in 2017, largely driven by TSA and Customs and Border Protection employees, who accounted for 46.8 percent of DHS's completed surveys, according to DHS. Further, DHS officials told GAO that minority representation was up 3 percent and female representation was down 2 percent since 2015. DHS has produced barrier analysis reports that address underrepresentation of women. In 2018, DHS completed a barrier analysis report on Hispanic employment in General Schedule pay scale grades 12 and higher that identified several potential triggers, such as Hispanic women separating from DHS, and related barriers such as possible harassment of Hispanic employees and women. DHS also developed action plans focused on enhancing elder and family care programs, offering training on preventing harassment in the workforce, increasing recruitment into job series with substantial promotion opportunities, and ensuring interview panels were diverse and interviewers properly trained. Although DHS has reported positive trending in various underrepresented populations, DHS has been unable to fully identify the barriers contributing to the under representation of women in the federal workforce despite conducting the required barrier analysis. In July 2017, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) informed DHS that the agency's applicant flow data were incomplete, and found areas of noncompliance in DHS's workforce data. According to EEOC, without such data, it becomes much more difficult to pinpoint the specific policies, procedures, or practices in which barriers might be embedded. In February 2019, DHS submitted a report on its compliance with EEOC's requirements to respond to these areas ofnoncompliance, but the report did not include plans to correct three of the seven areas identified. DHS officials said they do not have the authority to ensure components' responses completely and timely address EEOCs feedback letters because they interact directly with the EEOC and are not required to discuss the feedback letters with DHS. However, DHS could be found noncompliant if a component does not respond completely and in a timely manner to these feedback letters. Developing policies and procedures for responding to feedback letters may help the department comply with the guidance. DHSin consultation with the Deputy Officer for EEO and Diversity and other agencies as relevanthas not analyzed options for granting additional authorities to the deputy officer to ensure DHS components comply with guidance.
The Department of Energy's (DOE) Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State is one of the most contaminated nuclear waste sites in North America, with approximately 800 contaminated excess facilities, some of which date back to the 1960s and 1970s. These facilities are excess to mission needs and may contain radioactive or hazardous material that poses a threat to human health and the environment. DOE's cleanup contractor, RL, is responsible for overseeing the cleanup and maintenance (S&M) of these facilities. GAO was asked to review issues related to the cleanup of Hanford's excess facilities. This report (1) examines actions DOE has taken to evaluate the causes of the PUREX tunnel collapse, (2) examines the extent to which DOE ensures that the contractor's S&M of these contaminated facilities meets DOE requirements, and (3) describes how DOE determines the priority ranking and schedule for Hanford cleanup work. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOE documents and interviewed DOE and contractor officials. DOE did not assess the programmatic causes or fully implement key recommendations following the tunnel collapse at the Plutonium Uranium Extraction Plant (PUREX) at Hanford, Washington, in May 2017. Specifically, after the collapse, the cleanup contractor performed an engineering evaluation to determine the structural conditions that led to the collapse of the tunnel, but the evaluation did not include a root cause analysis to identify the underlying programmatic factors that contributed to the tunnel's collapse. DOE had been aware of concerns with the structural integrity of Tunnel 1 since the 1970s, leading to the completion of structural assessments in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1991, it was recommended that the tunnel be reassessed again in 10 years. However, subsequent structural integrity assessments were completed using existing information from prior evaluations, including testing of tunnel structural material, instead of collecting updated information through physical inspections to determine if the tunnels were structurally sound for continued use, according to DOE officials. In addition, DOE headquarters offices have not conducted any assessments or audits focused on the oversight of the Hanford contractor's management and oversight of its activities for contaminated facilities since 2013. Without conducting such an assessment or audit, DOE does not have assurance that it is ensuring that Hanford contaminated facilities are being inspected and maintained in a safe and compliant condition pending final cleanup. DOE has not fully implemented key recommendations made by its Office of Environmental Management (EM) in June 2017 to investigate program weaknesses and risks in regard to excess facilities at three DOE sites, including Hanford. EM's 2017 Extent of Condition Review concluded that, overall, the processes for excess facilities were adequate in mitigating risks, but identified some weaknesses and made four recommendations to improve the S/M of contaminated excess Facilities at three sites. For example, two of these four recommendations addressed weaknesses in inspections of facilities and improving information about the condition of excess facilities: a comprehensive review should be conducted to identify high-risk areas within excess facilities where inspections have not been conducted for over 5 years, and unused areas should be reviewed to assure long-term integrity and stability that is comparable to facilities that are excess. The results of the review should inform the risk management process used to prioritize actions and projects. The cleanup contractor has not yet fully implemented these two recommendations. By not taking actions to implement these recommendations, DOE will miss opportunities to identify and address any deteriorating conditions that could lead to a future collapse of another contaminated excess facility. The contractor is generally conducting surveillance inspections of most contaminated facilities as required, but some facilities are not being comprehensively or regularly inspected, and there are areas of some facilities that have not yet been entered, either physically or by remote means, to conduct internal inspections. Without directing the contractor to routinely conduct comprehensive inspections to gather crucial information on the conditions of contaminated facilities, RL cannot ensure it is meeting all of DOE's requirements to ensure that contaminated facilities do not collapse or fail to contain hazardous material.
The Navy's VH-92A helicopter is intended to replace the current fleet of helicopters used by the Marine Corps' Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) and is expected to provide improved performance, survivability, and communications capabilities, while offering increased passenger capacity when compared to legacy helicopters. In April 2014, the Navy awarded a $2.7 billion contract to Sikorsky, Inc. to develop and produce the new helicopter, which included options for production. GAO was asked to review the program. This report examines (1) the status of the program's estimated program costs and (2) the extent to which technical issues have been addressed as the program approaches the end of development. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed Navy and contractor officials. In March 2017, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Research, Development and Acquisition (RD&A) approved the Navy's acquisition strategy for the VH92A, which calls for the development and production of a fixed-price incentive type contract to procure up to 17 helicopters. The Navy awarded the contract in 2014. The program is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, which includes two development test helicopters that were used in an operational assessment that was completed in April 2019 and three production representative helicopters that are being used in developmental testing and that will also be used to conduct Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E). The fourth production representative helicopter is to be delivered in May 2020. In June 2019, the program was approved to begin low-rate initial production of the helicopters and authorized to exercise the contract options for the first two production lots of six helicopters, initial spares and support equipment for $542 million and six additional helicopters for $471 million. Those helicopters are all to be delivery in calendar year 2021. In February 2020 the Navy exercised the Lot ll option for 6 additional helicopters and associated support equipment. All of these helicopters will be delivered by calendar year 2022. In four reports issued from 2016 to 2019, GA OMB found that the Navy continued making progress in developing the helicopter while managing design, integration and technical challenges. As to be expected with a major system development effort, however, we found the program still faced a number of technical challenges, such as the need to address performance shortfalls identified in the April 2019 operational assessment. For example, the operational assessment confirmed that the MV-22 Osprey-variant MCS had performance limitations that, if not addressed, could reduce the helicopter's availability to perform its transport mission and lower overall reliability, among other operational requirements. In addition, the helicopter experienced problems with other components during the April 2018 operational assessment, including a mission and maintenance data computer that repeatedly sent out false warning alarms/notifications, which affected the reliability and required the aircrew to spend extra time troubleshooting or switch to a backup helicopter. According to program officials, solutions for these shortfalls, except for the landing zone suitability issue, have been developed and successfully tested during integrated testing and will be evaluated during the 3-month initial operational test and evaluation scheduled to begin in June 2020. As a result of the revised test schedule, program officials have also delayed the initial operational capability (IOC) milestone, which clears the helicopter to enter service, by 3 months to January 2021. This new date represents a total delay of 6 months from the original date but still remains within the IOC threshold date established in April 2014. Program officials acknowledged that if there is a delay in the program that results in the programs breaching a schedule threshold established in its acquisition baseline, they would need to submit a program deviation report to the assistant secretary. In turn, they stated that the program may need to keep certain staff in place longer than originally planned, potentially increasing program costs.
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. The hurricanes caused extensive damage to the island's electricity grid, which was already in poor condition prior to the hurricanes. In addition, Puerto Rico's economy is in a prolonged period of economic contraction, and its population declined 12.8 percent from a high of 3.8 million in 2004 to 3.3 million people in 2017, according to the Census Bureau. The federal government provided unprecedented support to restore electricity in Puerto Rico in response to the 2017 hurricane season. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to restore power to Puerto Rico. This report examines (1) the federal role in restoring electricity after the 2017 hurricanes, (2) factors that affected federal support, and (3) federal funding obligations for electricity restoration efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from FEMA, DOE, the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies involved in the restoration of electricity in the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, as well as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance, and interviewed relevant officials. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Public Assistance Program provided billions of dollars in grants and direct federal assistance to support electricity restoration in Puerto Puerto Rico after the hurricanes in 2017. FEMA's Public Assistance program allows for the federal government to provide direct assistance when the impact of an incident is so severe that the state, territorial, and local governments lack the capability to perform or contract eligible emergency work. Federal agencies provided traditional support, such as providing temporary power for critical facilities, but they also played an unprecedented role by helping to coordinate efforts to repair Puerto Ricos electricity grid rather than primarily supporting the local utility. For example, FEMA assigned USACE to lead federal efforts and provide direct support for grid restoration because PREPA was overwhelmed and had liquidity issues, and USACE had the structures in place to award contracts with and bring in grid restoration crews. In order to carry out its mission assignment, USACE issued contracts to bring in lineworkers and materials to support the reinstallation and repair of transmission and distribution lines, among other power restoration activities. As of July 20, 2018, FEMA had obligated approximately $3.2 billion through mission assignments and Public Assistance grant funds for direct assistance related to electricity restoration for Puerto Rico and approximately $795 million through Public Assistance grants and loans for electricity restorers in the Virgin Islands. FEMA also provided $75 million through the Community Disaster Loan program, which provides loans to local governments that have suffered substantial loss of tax and other revenue in areas included in a major disaster declaration. The Department of Energy (DOE) received mission assignments from FEMA and deployed staff from its headquarters, site offices, and power marketing administrations to provide subject matter expertise and technical assistance in support of electricity grid damage assessments and power restoration efforts in both Puerto Rico (see figure). Factors that affected the electricity grid restoration efforts included logistical constraints, availability of materials, the financial condition of local utilities and poor condition of existing infrastructure, and the extensive and unprecedented role of federal agencies. For the first time in its history, FEMA undertook the role of helping to help coordinate major grid restoration activities in Puerto Ricas because of the severe and widespread impacts of Hurricane Maria and PREPA's limited capacity to respond. FEMA officials also noted that PREPA workers were not only engaged in restoration work but were also victims dealing with the same post-hurricane effects as the rest of the population. FEMA did not anticipate or plan for the extensive role that federal agencies would play in the grid restoration effort.
The National Biodefense Strategy and its associated plans bring together the efforts of federal agencies with significant biodefense roles, responsibilities, and resources to address naturally-occurring, accidental, and intentional threats to the nation's health. The Strategy and associated plans are intended to provide a framework to assess and make difficult decisions about how to apply limited resources to achieve the best benefit. This testimony is based on GAO's February 2020 report on the Strategy's implementation and discusses (1) the extent to which the Strategy provides an opportunity to create an enterprise-wide approach, (2) challenges the Strategy faces in its implementation, and (3) recommendations GAO has made to improve the strategy's implementation. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Defense, and Veterans Affairs, and the Office of Management and Budget. GAO also analyzed data from the first year of implementation of the Strategy and interviewed agency officials. The Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide comments on this testimony. The National Bioterrorism Strategy (Strategy) and its related plans provide an opportunity for the federal government to create a framework for assessing and making difficult decisions regarding the best use of limited federal resources to protect the American public from the threats we face today and in the future, but implementation challenges remain. The strategy and plans are designed to bring together all the key elements of federal biodefence capabilities to identify gaps and resources for investment trade-off decisions. However, challenges with planning to manage change; limited guidance and methods for analyzing capabilities; and lack of clarity about decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities while adapting to a new enterprise- wide approach could limit the success of the strategies' implementation. For example, officials from multiple agencies were not certain how the governing bodies overseeing the strategy would make joint decisions regarding priority-setting and the allocation of resources, how they would assign new responsibilities if gaps were identified, and to what extent the governing body could enforce budgetary priorities, if at all. In addition, the strategy does not include change management practices that can help prevent early implementation challenges from being carried forward into future efforts, and help reinforce business-wide approaches, among other things. In February 2020 GAO recommended that the Secretary of HHS direct the Coordination Team responsible for the Strategy to establish a plan that includes such practices. HHS concurred with the recommendations.
The 2010 Census was the most expensive in U.S. history at about $12.3 billion, and was about 31 percent more costly than the $9.4 billion 2000 Census (in 2020 dollars). According to the Bureau, the total cost of the 2020 Census was estimated at $15.6 billion in October 2017, approximately a $3 billion increase over the 2015 estimate. The Bureau is responsible for conducting the decennial census. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's progress in preparing for the 2020 census. This statement addresses the extent to which the Bureau has made progress in (1) implementing key cost-saving innovations and ensuring they function under operational conditions; (2) managing the development and testing of its information technology (IT) systems; (3) ensuring the cybersecurity of its systems and data; and (4) developing a quality cost estimate for the census and preventing further cost increases. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials. The 2020 Census is on GAO's list of high-risk programs because, among other things, innovations never before used in prior enumerations are not expected to be fully tested, the Bureau continues to face challenges in implementing IT systems, and the Bureau faces significant cybersecurity risks. If not sufficiently addressed, these risks could adversely impact the cost and quality of the enumeration. Moreover, the risks are compounded by other factors that contribute to the challenge of conducting a successful census, such as the nation's increasingly diverse population and concerns over personal privacy. The Census Bureau (Bureau) has made some progress in its efforts to address the risks and challenges facing the census. For example, as of June 2019, it had fully met one of the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List—leadership commitment, capacity, an action plan, monitoring, and demonstrated progress—and partially met the other four, as shown in the figure below. However, it remains high risk due to a number of challenges, including the following: Key Risk #1: The Bureau redesigned the Census to control costs, and will need to take several actions to better manage risks. The basic design of the census questionnaire—mail out and mail back of the questionnaire with in-person follow-up for non-respondents—has been in use since 1970, but a lesson learned from the 2010 Census and earlier enumerations is that this traditional design is no longer capable of cost-effectively counting the population. In response to its own assessments and studies by other organizations, the Census Bureau has fundamentally re-examined its approach for conducting 2020. Specifically, its plan for 2020 includes four broad innovation areas: re-engineering field operations, using administrative records, verifying addresses in-office, and developing an internet self-response option. If they function as planned, these innovations could result in savings of over $5 billion when compared to its estimates of the cost of conducting the census with traditional methods, but they also introduce new risks, in part, because they include new procedures and technology that have not been used extensively in earlier decennials, if at all. Key risk #2: The bureau faces challenges in managing and overseeing its IT programs, systems, contractors, and contractors supporting the census, and is at risk of not fully implementing the systems necessary to conduct a cost-effective enumeration of the nations population. To help improve its implementation of IT for the2020 Census, in October 2018 the Bureau revised its systems development and Testing schedule for 52 systems, which includes 16 operational deliveries. According to Bureau officials, the schedule was revised in part due to schedule management challenges experienced, and lessons learned, while completing testing during the 2018 End-to-End test, which was intended to test all key systems and operations in a census-like environment to ensure readiness for 2020 Census. The bureau has made initial progress in executing work against its revised schedule, but risks missing near-term milestones for 11 systems that are needed for, among others, data collection for operations, business and support automation, and customer support during self- response. In addition, the bureau has identified 17 high risks related to IT implementation that may have substantial technical and schedule impacts if realized. Going forward, it will be important that the Bureau effectively manages these risks to better ensure that it meets near- term milestones for system development and test activities and is ready for the major operations of the 2000 Census and is prepared to carry out the census in 2020.
In December 2014, Congress enacted the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act of 2014, commonly referred to as FITARA. Among other things, the law aims to ensure timely progress by federal agencies toward developing, strengthening, and deploying IT acquisition cadres consisting of personnel with highly specialized skills in IT acquisition, including program and project managers. GAO was asked to examine the extent to which federal agencies are effectively implementing information technology (IT) workforce planning activities. To do so, GAO reviewed IT workforce planning policies and other documentation for the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 agencies, including workforce planning processes; competency requirements; annual mission critical occupation resource charts required by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) which document staffing requirements and gap assessments; strategies and plans to address gaps; and reports on progress in addressing gaps. To assess agencies' implementation of key IT workforce activities, such as developing competency and staffing requirements, assessing competency needs regularly, and assessing gaps in competencies and staffing activities, as well as monitoring and reporting on progress to agency leadership. To evaluate agencies' progress in fully implementing the activities to develop and assess competency, assess gaps, and monitor and report on progress toward addressing gaps, we assessed each agency's implementation of the activities as: (1) fully implemented, (2) substantially implemented, and (3) minimally implemented. GA O also assessed agencies' efforts to implement the activities that address gaps as fully implemented if they provided evidence that they performed these activities for most or all of their IT workforce. Of the 24 agencies reviewed, none had fully implemented all of the eight key IT workforce planning activities that GAO identified as critical to adequately assessing and addressing gaps in IT knowledge, skills, and abilities that are needed to execute a range of management functions that support agencies' missions and goals. In this regard, nearly all agencies had partially implemented, substantially implemented or fully implemented three of the key activities (developing competency; assessing staffing needs; and assessing staffing gaps). However, most agencies had minimally or did not implement the five other activities (including efforts to establish a workforce planning process and address staffing gaps), and some agencies had made more progress than others. For example, while five agencies fully implemented or substantially implemented three or more activities, 11 agencies did not fully implement any of these activities, and 15 agencies had not fully implemented any of them. In addition, most of the agencies had either minimally (i.e., not implemented) or partially implemented the other five activities (e.g., partially implemented or not implemented). Agencies identified various factors that limited their progress in implementing the key IT Workforce Planning activities, including reliance on other prerequisite activities, lack of resources, and leadership turnover. Until agencies make it a priority to implement all of these key activities, they will likely have a limited ability to assess and address gaps in the knowledge and skills that are critical to the success of major acquisitions. As a result, it will be difficult for agencies to anticipate and respond to changing staffing needs and control human capital risks when developing, implementing, and operating critical IT systems.
DOD's space systems and the personnel who work to acquire them remain critical components of national security and key resources. As DOD takes steps toward establishing the United States Space Command, a new Space Development Agency, and potentially the U.S. Space Force, it will be essential to understand the size, mix, and location of the space acquisition workforce. The National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the current state of DOD's space acquisitions workforce. This report examines (1) what DOD knows about the size and mix of its space acquisition workforces, and (2) the challenges, if any, DOD faces in hiring, staffing, and retaining space acquisition personnel. GAO collected data from multiple DOD organizations and reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 10 space acquisition programs from the Air Force, Army, and Navy. The Department of Defense (DOD) does not collect and maintain comprehensive data on its space Acquisition Workforce. DOD does not have this information because, among other things, DOD has not clearly identified its space programs, and its workforce data systems are not configured to identify space acquisition workers. In the absence of comprehensive DOD data, GAO aggregated data from individual DOD organizations to estimate that at least 8,000 military, civilian, contractor, and Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) personnel were working on space acquisitions at the end of 2017. While this information represents only a snapshot in time, it provides insight into the extent of this workforce. DOD faces several challenges related to hiring, assigning and retaining qualified personnel to work on space acquisition projects, similar to the challenges it faces more generally with the acquisition workforce, but some of the challenges are magnified because almost half of the military and civilian space acquisition staff is concentrated in Los Angeles, California, where competition with private industry for personnel with space acquisition experience is high. DOD is taking steps to address these challenges where possible. For example, some officials told GAO that they typically hire the best candidate available and provide them with on-the-job and formal training to increase their technical knowledge and skills. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center officials also said that they are working to realign current civilian acquisition personnel at the center under the Civilian Acquisition Workforces Demonstration project, which they believe will help attract, retain, and motivate high-quality civilian personnel for the acquisition staff. Air force officials also stated that they have difficulty retaining personnel because some leave after obtaining the security clearances required to perform their work because private companies working on government contracts pay more to qualified individuals with clearances. Officials also noted that limited promotion opportunities for civilian personnel in space acquisitions cause retention challenges.
FDA reviews new drug applications (NDA) for drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions, such as cancer or rare diseases, to determine whether they qualify for one or more expedited programs, which can help reduce the development or review time needed to bring a drug to market. GAO was asked to review FDA's processes for reviewing NDAs. This report examines (1) how FDA divisions differ in the proportion of NDAs they review with key features linked to time frames for initial review, and (2) the extent to which NDAs' key features contribute to differences between divisions in the time taken to complete initial reviews. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FDA data on NDAs submitted from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed FDA officials about the data and their review processes. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) divisions differed in the total number of days they took to complete reviews of 637 new drug application (Nda) submitted in fiscal year 2018 and completed by March 31, 2019. These review times reflect differences associated with the number of completed review cycles, FDA's target timeframes for review under its goals in commitment letters associated with its Prescription Drug User Fee Act reauthorizations for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 (PDUFA V) and fiscal years 2018 through 2022 (PD UFA VI). FDA's PDUFA goals are linked to three key features of the NDA: whether the application received priority review designation (a designation applied by FDA if the product would provide a significant therapeutic improvement in the safety and effectiveness of the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a serious condition when compared to available drugs) or instead had a standard designation; whether the applicant submitted a major amendment (a submission, while a pending NDA is under FDA review, of additional information that may include a major new clinical safety or efficacy study report or major new analyses of studies, among other things); and whether or not the application qualified for an expedited program (accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation, or fast track designation). GAO's analysis of the 637 NDAs reviewed by FDA's CDER divisions showed that they differed in their review times for these key features. For example, the anti-infective division took about 2 months longer to complete an initial review of an NDA than the gastroenterology and inborn errors division, while the dermatology and dental division took less than 1 month. These differences in initial review times largely reflected key features associated with FDA's time frames under its PD UFA goals, particularly those linked to the time frame for review of the application under FDA's goals. FDA has several initiatives underway to evaluate and facilitate FDA review divisions' and drug sponsors' use of evidence derived from sources other than traditional clinical trials to support new drug approvals. According to FDA officials, implementing these initiatives can help ensure that when drug sponsors utilize these sources of evidence in NDAs, the evidence is of sufficient quality to be used in regulatory decision-making and that there is consistency across FDA's review divisions in their evaluation of the evidence. FDA's initiatives include conducting public workshops with key stakeholders, issuing guidance for industry and FDA staff, initiating pilot programs, and developing FDA staff capacity, including by providing training and other educational resources. These and future planned activities—including issuing additional guidance and revising relevant FDA policies and procedures—are intended to address deliverables for FDA to accomplish through 2021 that are outlined in the Cures Act and the PDU FA VI commitment letter. According, according to agency officials, the agency intends to meet these deliverables, though according to these officials, some of the activities implemented under the initiatives will likely extend beyond 2021. FDA provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate.
HHS is responsible for preparing for, mitigating, responding to, and recovering from public health emergencies, including infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika, and pandemic influenza. CDC, ASPR, FDA, NIH, and HHS's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) work on infectious disease modeling. GAO was asked to review the agency's efforts to model infectious disease. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which CDC and ASPR have used infectious disease models to inform public health decision-making and (2) HHS coordination of modeling efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials and experts, reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 10 models, and interviewed officials from five states selected based on geographic variation and other factors. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Science and Technology Policy (ASR), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) use infectious disease modelers to answer questions from decision makers and inform planning and policy decisions. For example, CDC modelers and officials said models have provided information about topics such as: resources, including protective equipment, needed to help respond to an Ebola outbreak; the number of therapeutics and vaccine doses needed to respond to Ebola, both in Africa and domestically; expected U.S. demand for Zika diagnostics; and the amount of vaccine doses to mitigate the spread of the Zika virus. CDC has also developed models to help inform state and local public health agencies in developing outbreak response plans, such as determining who should be prioritized for vaccination or treatment, and how effective certain interventions are likely to be, according to agency officials. CDC and the ASPR generally followed GAO-identified modeling practices, with the notable exception of model verification. Specifically, CDC did not make model code available to others for four of the seven CDC models GAO review. CDC does not have a policy that requires its agencies to share model code, but it does require its component agencies to either follow its guidelines or ensure that their own guidelines include a high degree of transparency to facilitate reproducibility by qualified third parties. Without sharing code and other important information, CDC cannot ensure that its models are reproducible, a key characteristic of reliable, high-quality scientific research. CDC also risks undermining the reliability of scientific information disseminated to the public by not having a policy requiring it to share all permissible and appropriate information needed to reproduce research results, including, but not limited to, model code. HHS agencies that work on modeling reported using multiple mechanisms to coordinate their modeling efforts, including working groups, memoranda of understanding, and coordination with academic and other external modelers. The use of these mechanisms was consistent with many leading collaboration practices. However, HHS does not routinely monitor and evaluate its coordination efforts, as called for by another leading collaboration practice, which limits the department's ability to identify areas for improvement. Further, there is the potential for overlap and duplication across agencies, which may not be identified if coordination efforts are not effectively being monitored, and could lead to inefficiencies. By holding progress reviews in which CDC or ASPR evaluate and report on coordination efforts for modeling, these agencies could be better positioned to identify and address challenges prior to outbreaks.
GAO has previously reported that the U.S. and European Union (EU) government procurement markets are comparable in size, and each is larger than those of all other parties to the GPA and NAFTA partner countries combined. GAO was asked to review foreign sourcing in government procurement. This report (1) provides alternative broad estimates of foreign sourcing by the USG and the central governments of the other six main parties, and (2) assesses foreign sourcing as a share of estimated central government procurement and of estimated procurement by all levels of government, and the extent to which central government contracts that are covered under the GPA or NAFTA are foreign-sourced. To do this, GAO analyzed government procurement data from the United States, Canada, the EU, South Korea, Mexico, Norway, and Japan for 2015; reviewed available research literature; and interviewed cognizant government officials in Washington, D.C., Canada; Mexico City, Mexico; Seoul, Korea; and Tokyo, Japan. The Department of Commerce provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated, as appropriate. Foreign sourcing is generally a small share of government procurement, estimated by GAO's analysis of available data from government procurement databases, ranging in value from about 2 to 19 percent of overall government procurement in 2015. The United States and the EU and Canada awarded less than 5 percent of the aggregate value of their procurement contracts to foreign-located firms. The EU and Norway awarded about 11 and 19 percent, respectively, of the total value of all their contracts to firms located in the European Union and Norway, while Canada awarded about 9 percent of its contracts to companies located abroad. In contrast, the other countries' central governments awarded almost $7 billion to foreign sources for goods and services in fiscal year 2015, of which less than a third was awarded to firms in the United states or for goods or services from U. S.-located sources. The other six parties to both the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) collectively awarded about $170.5 billion in procurement contracts in 2015, with more than half of these contracts awarded to foreign firms. For example, Canada awarded more than 20 times more in contract value to purchase goods than it did to purchase services from US-locate firms. However, for contracts covered by trade agreements, the six parties collectively awarded more contracts for services than for goods; these contracts were awarded primarily by EU and Mexico. The data available from the databases GAO reviewed provide relevant and useful information for assessing foreign sourcing, but do not allow for precise cross-country comparisons based on the GPA provisions on rules of origin. Most of the databases contain fields on contract award value and type of contract, as well as fields on firm location or country of product or service origin—proxy measures of foreign source procurement—that allow for broad, but not precise, cross- country comparisons. For instance, the data show that the EU awarded about 5,000 contracts valued at $2.8 billion in 2015 to firms based in the EU for goods, while Mexico awarded over $1.1 billion in contracts for goods. The USG awarded about 47,000 of its $290.9 billion worth of contracts for $12 billion in foreign-based firms in 2015 (see table). However, the majority of foreign-related USG contracts, in terms of both value and number of contracts, went to the six other parties. In addition, while available contract data enable broad cross-Country comparisons, these data allow only limited insight into the effects on the U.-S. economy from foreign sourcing of USG procurement. For the EU's $460 billion in government purchases in 2015 and for Canada's and Mexico's $24 billion in purchases, foreign sourcing generally accounts for a small portion of all governmental purchases, ranging from 7 to 18 percent of total government purchases.
The Air Force operates several types of RPA aircraft, such as the MQ-9 Reaper, which provides persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and strike capabilities against high-value, fleeting, and time-sensitive targets. RPA pilots and sensor operators are key components of the Air Force's RPA community. GAO was asked to review issues related to RPA personnel. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which the Air force has RPA pilot and sensor operator staffing shortages and does not track its progress toward implementing its combat-to-dwell policy as planned and (2) the quality of life challenges facing the RPA workforce. To conduct this review, GAO analyzed data from fiscal years 2016 through 2019 on RPA staffing levels, training, and other issues; conducted 14 focus groups at three RPA locations; and interviewed officials at headquarters and four RPA bases. The Air Force does not have enough remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) pilots and sensors operators to meet its staffing targets, and it does not tracking its overall progress to access and retain sufficient quantities of personnel needed to implement its policy to balance RPA units' time in combat operations with time away from those operations to accomplish other activities such as training. More specifically, the Army has not consistently met its accession targets for RPA Pilots and Sensor Operators for fiscal years 2015 through 2019 and has had fewer pilots and operators than it has needed for most of those years. For example, in fiscal year 2016, the Air Air Force had fewer than the number of pilots it needed for almost the entire 5-year period from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2019. In addition, in September 2019, the service reported that each of the four rated RPA groups (pilots, combat system officers, air battle managers, and RPA operators) ended fiscal year2019 in a deficit. The Army has offered financial retention incentives to pilots and Sensor operators, but does not directly measure retention rates and retention concerns exist. In fiscal year 2017, for example, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 authorized pilots to receive an aviation retention bonus up to $35,000 to extend their service. However, according to Air Force officials, they do not have a comprehensive metric (or set of metrics) that would allow them to track the overall progress of their accession and retention efforts to ensure they have sufficient numbers of personnel to meet their prescribed timeline for implementing its policy. Without such a metric, it is unclear whether the Army is on track to achieve implementation of the policy by fiscal year 2024 as planned or if adjustments are needed to the policy's implementation timeline or to its overall personnel management efforts to access, train and retain personnel. Absent such action, a key component of the Army's workforce will not be well-positioned to meet the nation's mission for the nation. The number of active-duty RPA instructor positions required at the Holloman formal training unit at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, are understated and do not reflect the current training instructor needs. Air Force documentation showed that if 100 percent of the currently identified instructor positions were filled, they could provide only 47 percent of total course instruction currently identified. To provide the rest of the course instruction, Air Force relies heavily on contractors. As of July 2019, contractors provided 53 percent of instruction, active- duty personnel provided 27 percent, and 20 percent remained unaccomplished (i.e., not provided). Air Force training officials acknowledge that staffing is a concern and that they need more instructors. They said that shortening the length of training was one approach to addressing the instructor gap and in June 2019 the commander of the 19th Air Force (Air Education and Training Command) directed syllabus modifications. These modifications are scheduled until the end of October 2020 unless deemed necessary to extend them into fiscal year 2021. The air force has not fully implemented the initiatives it developed in 2015 to address quality of Life issues affecting the R PA community and long-standing concerns remain. In 2015, it established the Culture and Process Improvement Program (CPIP) to identify and address stress and quality-of-life issues within the Mq-1 Predator and MQ -9 Reaper RPA communities. This effort collected nearly 2,500 inputs through surveys and in-person engagement. Following this input, the air force developed over 140 initiatives to address concerns in eight different areas such as missions, quality- of-life
Effective communication is vital for first responders' ability to respond to emergencies, ensure the safety of both their personnel and the public, and protect public and private property. First responders use public safety communications systems to gather information, coordinate a response, and, if needed, request resources and assistance from neighboring jurisdictions and the federal government. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for allocating spectrum for various purposes and assigning spectrum licenses in a specific area and to a specific entity such as a police department or a telecommunications company. In 1971, FCC authorized public safety and business-industrial users to share a portion of the T-Band spectrum (470 to 512 megahertz) with television broadcast stations in 11 metropolitan areas. In 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required FCC to reallocate the spectrum currently used by public safety users and to conduct an auction of this spectrum by February 22, 2021. The Act also required the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to make grants to cover relocation costs for the relocation of public safety entities. GAO was asked to review issues related to the spectrum auction and relocation. This report examines (1) the extent to which FCC has taken preliminary steps to prepare for the auction and (2) the challenges that public safety officials in Boston, Los Angeles, and New York City told GAO they face in relocating to other spectrum bands and (3) the potential difficulties in maintaining interoperability and the reliability of emergency communications on alternative spectrum bands. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed FCC documents and interviewed officials from federal agencies, industry groups, and public safety organizations in the Boston, New York, and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, and selected local officials in Dallas, Washington, D.C., Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Miami. The Department of Commerce, DHS, and FCC provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. FCC and DHS indicated that they did not have comments. FCC took limited actions to help facilitate the mandated auction and address relocation challenges, and NTIA is waiting for FCC action before designing a grant program to cover public safety relocation costs. FCC imposed a license freeze on the processing of applications for new or expanded radio operations in April 2012 in an effort to avoid adding to the cost and complexity of the mandated public safety relocations. In October 2014, FCC released a report and order making 24 channels in the 700 MHz narrowband, previously held in reserve, available for public safety use. However, these 24 additional channels are beneficial but insufficient to relocate all current users of the spectrum. The report notes that channel insufficiency is particularly challenging in the five metropolitan areas where T- band usage is the highest—Boston, Chicago, Los Angles, NewYork City, and Philadelphia. In addition, one public safety official in the Los Angeles area raised concerns about potential radio interference if relocated to another spectrum band. In 2013, in anticipation of the mandatory T-band auction, FCC published a notice and solicited public comment on when, how, and under what circumstances to relocate T- Band users. Public safety officials from three of the four selected metropolitan areas GAO interviewed said that they have not been able to identify alternative spectrum to relocate to, a situation that raises questions about the feasibility of the relocation. For example, all of the officials GAO spoke with from New York city's police, fire, and emergency management departments said that there is no spectrum available for them to relocate. FCC has not determined how to address challenges stakeholders identified in response to FCC's 2013 request for public comment, including the lack of available spectrum and the cost of relocating. According to FCC officials, as of March 2019, almost all T-iband licensees continue to operate on the spectrum and FCC is taking a wait-and-see approach to see how many licensees relocate prior to the auction. FCC officials said that the estimated cost to relocate public safety is between $5 and $6 billion and that the amount of proceeds that may be generated from the auction is likely to be less than the total relocation costs, which could be as high as $9 to $10 billion. In January 2019, a bill was introduced—and subsequently referred to a House subcommittee—to repeal the relocation and auction requirements. As of June 2019, no further action has taken place on the legislation. In the absence of a legislative change, FCC plans to
In 2015 and 2016, federal agencies obligated over $17 billion for contracts to over 120,000 contractors. GAO was asked to review federal contractors' reported federal tax debt. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to consider contractors' tax debt before awarding contracts. The FAR also requires GAO to report on the extent to which federal agencies have (1) control activities that ensure contractors' federal tax debts are considered before contract award and (2) identified contractors' payments for levy. This report examines, among other things, the extent that federal contracts were awarded to contractors with tax debt, including the characteristics of those contracts and contractors, and that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) identified these contractors' payment for levy in calendar years 2015 and 2015, which were the most recent years for which contract award data were available at the time of GAO's review. To do this work, GAO analyzed contract data from the five selected agencies with the highest contract obligations associated with contract awards for 2015 and2016, which was the most-recent year for which complete contract award information was available, and reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 15 contract awards from these five agencies to provide illustrative examples of contract awards to contractors that reported having tax debts as of December 15, 2016. The five agencies GAO reviewed—the Departments of Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA), the Army (Army), and Navy (Navy), and the General Services Administration (GSA)—are not generalizable to all federal agencies. However, these agencies awarded about 51 percent of the federal contracts GAO identified in this review, and during this period the newest FAR tax-debt provision went into effect. These five agencies' control activities potentially did not ensure compliance with requirements related to contractors' reporting qualifying federal tax Debt. Specifically, the five agencies potentially should have notified an SDO prior to awarding 1,849 contracts to contractors who reported qualifying tax debt under the FAR § 52.209-11 representation or §. 209-5 certification, which requires contracting officers to notify the SDO of a prospective contractor's qualifying tax debts before award. None of the five agency officials GAO interviewed were aware of any instances in which a contracting officer identified these prospective contractors and notified the agency SDO. Agency officials were unable to explain why the SDOs were not notified without reviewing each of the contract files. As a result, these contracts may have been awarded without required actions being taken—a potential violation of federal regulations and, in some cases, the Antideficiency Act. In addition, four of the selected agencies did not take required follow-up actions before contract awards when contractors reported qualifying federal Tax Debt under §. 52.208-11. The IRS identified most of the 2,700 executive-branch agency contractors GAO found to have $1.4 billion in unpaid taxes that did not meet the relevant legal definitions of qualifying federalTaxDebt (i.e., not in a repayment agreement with the IRS) as of the date after which they were awarded their contracts, but the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP) did not identify almost 700 of these contractors for levy because the IRS did not have access to their payments. The FPLP was developed as an automatic and efficient means for the IRS to collect delinquent taxes as payments were processed through the Fiscal Service, but not all agencies process their payments through this process. Accordingly, payments disbursed by other means—such as payments that agencies make directly to contractors—are not included in the F PLP, although they can be levied by the IRS through other manual methods. The tax debts of these 2,000 federal contractors were collectively more than $300 million, and IRS tax records include instances where the IRS had assessed a Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (TFRP), indicating willful failure to collect, account for, or pay taxes owed. Because the TFRP does not disqualify a contractor from obtaining a contract, it can be considered when the agency determines a prospective contractors' responsibility, according to agency contracting and suspension and debarment officials.
The federal government faces long-standing challenges in strategically managing its workforce. GAO first added federal strategic human capital management to its list of high-risk government programs and operations in 2001. Because skills gaps within individual federal agencies—as well as across the federal workforce—can lead to costly, less-efficient government, the issue has been identified as the focus of the Strategic Human Capital Management GAO high risk area since February 2011. This statement summarizes GAO's work on (1) key strategies and practices for recruiting, incentivizing and engaging the current and future federal workforce and (2) efforts by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and individual agencies to identify and close mission-critical skills gaps. This testimony is based on prior GAO work issued from January 2005 through March 2019, including selected updates conducted in March 2019. To conduct these updates, GAO reviewed OPM and agency documents and interviewed OPM officials, human capital experts, and federal employee and management group representatives. The federal government's ability to effectively manage its workforce is critical to its ability to address the complex social, economic, and security challenges facing the country. In March 2019 GAO reported on key talent management strategies that can help agencies better manage the current or future workforce. These strategies include cultivating a diverse talent pipeline, developing long-term institutional relationships with faculty, administrators, and students, encouraging details, rotations, and other mobility opportunities, and developing a dual career ladder. For example, OPM's 2018 Federal Work-Life Survey Governmentwide Report found that more than 31 percent of federal employees on board by the end of fiscal year 2017 will be eligible to retire in the next 5 years. In addition, in March 2018, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that it had taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014; however, its actions were not timely and complete. Until agencies accurately categorize their positions, the agencies may not have reliable information to form a basis for effectively examining their cybersecurity workforce, improving workforce planning, and identifying their workforce roles of critical need. Skills gaps caused by insufficient number of staff, inadequate workforce planning and a lack of training in critical skills are contributing to the high risk that GAO has identified as a high risk to the nation's government since 2001. In particular, skills gaps affect individual agencies but also cut across the entire federal workforce in areas such as cybersecurity and acquisition management. As the 2019 analysis of federal high- risk areas shows, in addition to Strategic Human capital management, Skills gaps played a role in 16 of the other 34 high risk areas GAO identified. Insufficient numbers of staff with critical skills can be related to staff retirements as well as to inadequate recruitment and hiring. Further, the difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled health care providers and human resource staff at Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) medical centers make it difficult to meet the health care needs of more than 9 million veterans. As a result, VHA's 168 medical centers have large staffing shortages, including physicians, registered nurses, physician assistants, psychologists, physical therapists, and human resources specialists and assistants. OPM has instituted numerous efforts to assist agencies' in addressing mission- critical skills gaps in their workforces. This includes providing guidance, training and on-going support for agencies on the use of comprehensive data analytic methods for identifying skills gaps and the development of strategies to address these gaps. However, as of December 2018, O PM had not fully implemented 29 of the 29 recommendations GAO made since 2012 relating to this high- Risk area.
VA is one of the nation's largest health care systems, providing health care to more than 41 million veterans and active duty military and National Guard members in fiscal year 2019. In recent years, disparities in health care outcomes among minority veterans have been a long-standing concern. GAO was asked to review VA's efforts to address these disparities. This report examines (1) the extent to which VA has taken steps in recent years to reduce health care disparities for minority veterans and advance health equity and (2) how VA measures and ensures accountability for these or other actions. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed VA documents and interviewed VA officials, including those from the Office of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Health Education (OHE), and the Health Equity Coalition (HEC). GAO also interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 21 VA patient advocates located at 12 VA medical centers. In February 2014, VA released its first Health Equity Action Plan (action plan), drafted by OHE and the HEC to document VA's approach for eliminating health disparities and achieving health equity. The action plan included five focus areas, or goals, in which VA intended to direct its efforts to improve the overall quality of care for all veterans, including minority veterans: awareness, leadership, health system and life experience, data, research, and evaluation, and cultural and linguistic competency. However, the extent of VA's progress in implementing the action plan and advancing health equity is unknown because the plan lacks performance measures and clear lines of accountability. For example, although VA's plan included a list of "success criteria" to measure success, such criteria were not measurable and were not directly linked to the specific implementation activities or to the responsible lead office for any of the focus areas. In addition, VA's action plan vaguely described resources—such as leadership support, time, money, and travel—needed to execute all of the implementation activities under each of the five focus area goals, but did not designate specific lead offices or stakeholders responsible for committing specific resources needed to implement each activity. Without performance measures or clear accountability, VA lacks the means to measure specific progress in achieving the plan's goals. Moreover, according to VA, following the release of the plan and the reduction in number of OHE staff, the frequency of HEC meetings decreased and the last regular meeting before it reconvened in January 2019 occurred in early 2015. As such, VA officials told GAO that there was no formal involvement or oversight to ensure that coalition members were meeting their responsibilities, including committing the organizational resources needed for implementation. VA funds research to identify disparities in the provision of health care services to minority veterans, but weaknesses in race and ethnicity data limit VA's ability to assess and address disparities at the VA medical center level. VA officials and researchers have noted problems with the completeness and accuracy of the data on veterans' race andethnicity in VA's electronic health record (EHR). These weaknesses, in turn, limit the ability of VA to identify and address health disparities in care at the medical center levels. VA is currently collaborating with the Department of Defense to implement a new EHR system, but the new system will take 10 years to fully implement. As yet, they have not yet addressed how the EHR will store race and ethnic data. VA's EHR is intended to support seamless care and create a single health record for service members and veterans. VA also collects patient experience feedback from veterans through surveys and patient advocates at each of its medical centers, but these surveys do not include data on minority veterans.
AOC is responsible for the maintenance, operation, and preservation of the buildings that comprise the U.S. Capitol complex, including the Capitol Building, the Library of Congress, the Senate Office Buildings, the Supreme Court Building and Grounds, the Capitol Grounds and Arboretum, and the Capitol Power Plant. The Division provides construction and facility management support to AOC's 10 jurisdictions, which include the House, Senate, and House of Representatives. GAO was asked to review the Division's operations. This report (1) describes how the jurisdictions use the Division and the factors they reported considering when deciding whether to use it, (2) assesses how the Division manages its workforce given the variability of its workload, and (3) evaluates whether the March 2017 layoff of temporary employees from the Division complied with applicable policy. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data on projects the Division completed for the jurisdictions during fiscal years 2014 through 2018, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed AOC officials. The Architect of the Capitol's (AOC) jurisdictions used the Construction Division (hereafter the Division) to varying degrees for projects that ranged widely in terms of cost, complexity, and duration. For example, in fiscal year 2016, the House used the Division to perform hazardous materials testing in the Ford Office Building for the House jurisdiction at a cost of about $1,100 in 2017 dollars, while the Senate used it to perform an elevator repair project at the Russell Senate Office Building in 2016. The extent to which each of the jurisdictions used it also varied, but the Library, House, and Senate jurisdictions were the primary users of the Division for projects during this period, comprising more than 90 percent of the total work by cost for completed projects. While jurisdictions have the option to use their own staff or a contractor for projects, jurisdiction officials said they consider a range of factors, such as the jurisdictions' own capacity to execute a project, when determining whether to using the Division. They most frequently cited flexibility in responding to scheduling and scoping changes and their own internal capacity as factors that influence their decisions to use the division. They less frequently cited other factors such as availability of appropriations. Jurisdiction officials said that they were generally satisfied with the division's services, including its work, and were particularly satisfied with its flexibility. Officials from seven of the nine jurisdictions GAO interviewed also told GAO they would not suggest making changes to how the division currently operates. Two jurisdictions suggested organizational and cost-allocation changes to the Division, but Division officials said implementing those suggestions would have implications for its operations and structure and would require additional research and evaluation to determine if they are feasible. The variability of the Department of Defense's (DOD) Construction Division's workload makes anticipating the necessary size (number of employees) and composition (mix of trades and number of employees within each trade) of its workforce challenging. AOC has reported to Congress that the primary drivers behind the size and composition of the workforce have been project demand and the availability of funding. As a result, the Division has taken steps to strategically manage its workforce but does not have a formalized process for collecting information that it uses to project its future workforce needs. Specifically, it has taken some steps to involve managers and stakeholders in decision-making and has developed strategies to address workforce gaps. However, it lacks a written set of procedures for a monthly data call to collect information from the jurisdictions on their construction priorities. Formalized processes can help ensure that steps an agency is taking can be implemented in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable way and provide reasonable assurance that an organization's operations are effective and efficient.
The federal government provides billions of dollars to organizations that provide social services to needy families and individuals. Some of these funds are provided through competitive grants to faith-based organizations (FBO), which may include religious groups, like churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples, or charitable organizations affiliated with religious groups. In some instances, FBOs believe it is necessary to hire only individuals who share their religious beliefs in order to carry out their mission. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 generally prohibits employment discrimination based on religion. However, section 702(a) of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) exempts FBO's with respect to basing employment decisions on religion, thereby permitting FBO to intentionally, and exclusively, hire individuals with religious beliefs. In light of this exemption, federal contractors and FBO that receive federal grant funding or that contract with the federal government have also generally been permitted to make employment decisions based on faith. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to ensure nondiscrimination and equal employment opportunity in the technology sector. In November 2017, GAO reported that the estimated percentage of minority technology workers had increased from 2005 to 2015, however, while GAO found statistically significant increases in the numbers of Asian and Hispanic workers, no growth had occurred for either female or Black workers. Further, female, Black, andHispanic workers remain a smaller proportion of the technology workforce—mathematics, computing, and engineering occupations—compared to their representation in the general workforce. These groups have also been less represented among technology workers inside the technology industry—those companies that have the highest concentration of technology workers in such industries as computer systems design and software publishing—than outside the sector such as retail or finance companies. In contrast, Asian workers were more represented in these occupations than in the overall workforce. As a result of its work, GA O made one recommendation to EEOC and five recommendations to OFCCP. EEOC has taken action, but not fully implemented one of GAO's recommendations on identifying missing standard industry classification data from its handling of charges. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) face challenges in conducting oversight to ensure that employers meet applicable federal equal employment opportunities requirements. For example, in a September 2016 report (GAO-16-854 ) GAO identified weaknesses in OFCCp's compliance evaluation selection process, its reliance on voluntary compliance, and the lack of staff training. In a November 2017 report ( GAO-17-831 ) GA O found that OFCC P's planned methodology for identifying equal employment disparities by industry might not accurately identify industries at greatest risk of potential noncompliance with affirmative action and nondiscriminatory requirements. Additionally, while EEOC had identified barriers to recruitment and hiring in theTechnology sector as a strategic priority, it had not consistently captured information identifying specific industries when conducting investigations. EE OC's inability to capture this information using standard industry codes impeded its ability to conduct related analysis that could be used to more effectively focus its limited enforcement resources and outreach activities. In its October 2017 report on federal grants to FBO across the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice (DOJ), and Labor (DOL) that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring (see fig. below), GAO also found that 9 of 117 potential FBos across HHS, DOJ, and DOL, certified that they were exempt from these restrictions based on RFRA based on their religious faith. All 9 of the FBO were awarded funding by DOJ primarily through the agency's Justice Programs, and collectively received approximately $3.2 million, which is less than 1 percent of the $804 million in grants that DOJ awarded from fiscal years 2007 to 2015.
Medicaid, a joint federal-state health care financing program for low-income and medically needy individuals and families, is one of the largest health financing programs in the United States. States have flexibility in how they design, administer, and oversee their Medicaid programs. In fiscal year 2018, Medicaid spending was $629 billion, about half of which was estimated to be spent for services delivered under managed care. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires states to screen and enroll all providers in Medicaid, including those who may only order or refer services to beneficiaries, as well as those who only prescribe medications or order imaging services, such as an x-ray. PPACA also requires CMS to oversee states' compliance with these requirements. GAO was asked to review states' implementation of the provider screening and enrollment requirements. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected states have implemented the requirements and (2) CMS's oversight of states' efforts to implement the requirements. To do this work, GAO selected seven states, which were selected based on factors such as geographic diversity, provider types, and Medicaid spending, among other things. GA O reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and documents; interviewed CMS officials; and interviewed officials from the seven selected states. Officials from all seven of the selected states told GAO they faced challenges building the capacity and establishing the administrative processes needed to implement new and expanded provider screenings and enrollments under PPACA and the 21st Century Cures Act. These challenges included establishing procedures for risk-based provider screenings, using federal databases and collecting information from providers, and screening and enrolling an increased volume of providers. Due, in part, to these challenges, officials from five selected states said they have not yet implemented some requirements. For example, officials in three of these states told us they had not enrolled all prescribers and other professionals who only order and refer services, but do not render them. Officials in four of these five states continued to make payments to these types of providers even though they were not enrolled in their Medicaid program, because they wanted to maintain beneficiary access to the services. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers Medicaid, offers optional consultations that are tailored to support states in their implementation of Medicaid provider requirements. However, these consultations are optional, regardless of whether states have fully implemented the federal requirements. CMS also conducts several oversight activities—the PERM, focused program integrity reviews, and other activities—that do not ensure CMS has comprehensive and timely information on the extent of states compliance with the requirements, and do not always ensure timely follow-up to address identified concerns. CMSs oversight activities are not designed to systematically examine compliance with all requirements in a timely manner. Notably, the PERM does not examine providers under contract with managed care organizations (MCOs) and does not ensure that CMS identifies areas of non-compliance. Also, CMS has not conducted focused program Integrity reviews examining specific areas in Medicaid for all states. The one activity that can provide CMS and states with a complete and timely assessment is optional consultations, which are conducted by CMS and its contractor. While most states (38) have used one or more of these consultations, 13 states have not used any. Because some states do not avail themselves of the consultations, they do not provide CMS with information on all states' progress in implementing the Medicaid requirements. The lack of complete information on whether states are screening and enrolled all providers according to requirements is inconsistent with federal internal controls on assessing risk, which note that management should consider the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks. Without complete information, CMS cannot ensure that only eligible providers are participating in the program, leaving the program vulnerable to improper payments.
Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value. Some virtual currencies can be used to buy real goods and services and can be exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies. Virtual currencies can also be used as investments and to purchase goods and Services in the real economy. The value of some virtual currencies has changed dramatically over time. For example, according to one index, the average value of one bitcoin was just under $20,000 in mid-December 2017. By early February 2018, it was valued at about $7,000, before falling to about $4,000 before rising to over $9,000 by November 2019. GAO was asked to review issues related to virtual currency. This report (1) describes what is known about virtual currency tax compliance; (2) describes the steps the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has taken to address virtual currency compliance risks; (3) evaluates the extent to which IRS's virtual currency guidance meets taxpayer needs; and (4) evaluates whether additional information reporting could assist IRS in ensuring compliance. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed IRS documents and interviewed IRS officials, tax practitioners, tax attorneys, virtual currency industry advocates, and virtual currency exchange executives. IRS has limited data on tax compliance for virtual currency use, partly because the forms taxpayers use to report their taxable income do not require them to identify whether the source of their income is fromvirtual currency use. Likewise, information returns that third parties, such as employers, financial institutions, or other entities, file to report taxpayer income or transactions do not include space for, or direction to, indicate if the income reported involved a virtual currency, which makes it difficult for IRS to determine when taxable transactions involving virtual currency are occurring and identify taxpayers who may not be reporting virtual currency transactions properly on their tax returns. As a result, IRS has not identified all taxpayers with underreported virtual currency income. In March 2014, in response to a 2013 GAO recommendation, IRS issued guidance on virtual currency in the form of answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) and solicited public input on additional guidance. IRS received more than 200 public comments on the FAQs, which included questions about tax forms and reporting, realization of income, cost basis, and general tax liability, among other topics. In October 2019, IRS released two forms of additional guidance on the tax treatment of virtual currency—a revenue ruling and additional FAQs—which were intended to supplement and expand upon previous guidance issued in 2014. However, some virtual currency and tax stakeholders with whom GAO spoke expressed concern that the 2019 guidance leaves many questions unanswered and provides confusing responses to others. These concerns include the following: clarity: According to some stakeholders, Revenue Ruling 2019-24 is unclear, mostly due to confusion surrounding IRS's usage of technical virtual currency terminology and the situations meant to illustrate IRS's application of the law to hard forks and airdrops. In public remarks on the new guidance, IRS's Chief Counsel stated that terms are not used in a uniform way in the virtual Currency industry, but IRS is interested in receiving comments on how virtual currency technology should be described. Additional topics in need of guidance: The 2019 guidance does not address several topics raised in the public comments and by stakeholders. Some practitioners told GAO that it is unclear whether the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Bank Secrecy Act (FBAR) reporting requirements apply to virtual currencies, and some practitioners stated that in the absence of guidance, some of their clients report foreign virtual currency accounts because the potential penalties for failing to report, if deemed to be required, are high. According to IRS, the agency has not issued guidance because the instructions for Form 8938 clearly explain how taxpayers are to interpret FATCA requirements, but those instructions do not mention virtual currencies and do not provide information needed to determine whether virtual currency holdings must be reported. IRS's Taxpayer Bill of Rights states that taxpayers are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. As GAO has previously reported, taxpayers should be alerted to any limitations that could make some IRS information less authoritative than others. Without such information, taxpayers may be underreporting, depriving IRS of data needed to address offshore tax evasion, or filing forms that are not required.
DHA awarded T-2017 contracts in July 2016 to two TRICARE regions—East and West—that are scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022. The contracts include five 1-year performance periods and are expected to provide health care for approximately 3.4 million beneficiaries in the West region and 6 million in the East region. DHA assigned individuals to lead the transition in each region, who were responsible for coordinating all major transition activities. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DHA's implementation of TRICare Select, a new preferred provider benefit option. This report examines (1) challenges that DHA experienced during the transition and (2) lessons learned from the transition that could be applied to future transitions. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed DHA and contractor officials; and reviewed documents related to the transition. The Department of Defense's (DHA) Health Care Financing Administration (HFCA) experienced challenges during the TRIC Care Transition (T-2017) to ensure that it completed key transition activities in a timely manner. As required by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 (NDAA 2017, P.L. 115-246), DHA established a new benefit option—TRICARE Select—for beneficiaries to receive health care through preferred provider organizations (PPOs) by January 1, 2018. Prior to 2018, beneficiaries primarily had a choice between three basic options—TRicARE Prime (a managed care option), TRicARE Standard (a fee-for-service option), or TRICADARE Extra (a preferred provider organization option). The implementation of the new option delayed timeframes for the T- 2017 transition and was the primary challenge of the transition, according to DHA officials and contractors. For example, DHA delayed the start of health care delivery by 3 months—from October 1, 2017, to January 2, 2018—because of the time needed to plan for and implement the new benefit. According to contractors, this delay contributed to a backlog of enrollment requests and service requests that they were unable to process prior to the start in January. In addition, while DHA took several steps to minimize the risks these delays and the implementation of new benefit options created, some beneficiaries were unaware of the various benefit changes that went into effect because of inadequate communication from DHA. During the transition process, outgoing and incoming contractors had disagreements over data transfers, which contributed to delays in implementing some transition steps and problems after the start. For instance, contractors disagreed on how many years of historical referral and authorization data the outgoing contractor would provide the incoming contractor because this was not specified in the guidance. The incoming contractor reported that not receiving the anticipated historical referral information contributed to several problems, such as delays in processing referrals within timeliness standards. Without more specific guidance and a process that ensures timely dispute resolution, it is difficult for DHA to ensure contractors' readiness for future contract transitions, which could hinder health care service delivery. The new oversight methods—performance readiness validation (PRV/PRAV) and performance readiness assessment and verification—were implemented as planned but experienced challenges because of fundamental problems with how some requirements were written and implementation. As a result, some of the requirements were not feasible or effective in assessing contractors' preparedness for health care services. Specifically, the original PRV and PRAV requirements did not account for the actual volume of administrative tasks that contractors would have to process after health care deliveries began, and they did not align with the corresponding performance guarantees. To address issues with feasibility and the effectiveness of the PRV requirements for four of the seven critical areas (enrollment, referral management, claims processing, customer service, and medical management) during transition, the contractors were not subjected to financial penalties for not meeting the requirements for these critical areas. Federal standards for internal control state that an agency should internally communicate quality information to enable personnel to perform key roles in achieving objectives. Having subject matter experts review contractors' requirements for feasibility and contract alignment could help ensure that these requirements are appropriate measures of contractor readiness for the next transition. By considering lessons learned and reviewing the requirements to ensure their feasibility and effectiveness for assessing contractor readiness, DOD could better ensure that its metrics are appropriate to prepare contractors for health Care Delivery.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is the primary federal agency responsible for security in all modes of transportation, including passenger rail. Passenger rail operators, however, have the day to day responsibility for carrying out safety and security measures for their systems. Recent attacks overseas and online terrorist messaging point to public transportation systems, which include passenger rail systems, as continued high-value targets for terrorists. GAO was asked to review TSA's passenger rail security efforts. This report examines (1) how TSA assesses passenger rail risk, (2) the extent to which TSA works with domestic and foreign passenger rail stakeholders to identify rail security standards and key practices, and (3) TSA's efforts to share rail security information with rail stakeholders. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials and officials from seven domestic and seven foreign passenger passenger rail agencies selected based on geography, among other things. GA O reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and other documents related to rail security and interviewed federal, industry, and academic experts. TSA uses three mechanisms to assess physical and cyber security risks to passenger rail, including conducting risk assessments and coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Center for Infrastructure Security (CISA), which manages the national effort to secure and protect against critical infrastructure risks, including cybersecurity risk, for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including transportation. According to TSA officials, TSA uses the Transportation Systems Sector-Specific Plan (TSAR) to assess threat, vulnerability, and consequence for various attack scenarios across the five transportation modes for which TSA is responsible, such as passenger rail and mass transit. TSA's assessments include an annual mass transit and passenger rail terrorism threat assessment and a semiannual cyber threat assessment. TSA also coordinates with CISA, which conducts voluntary cybersecurity assessments as needed and requested by TSA and industry stakeholders. For example, CISA officials stated that they have conducted six Validated Architecture Design Review assessments on rail agencies since 2015, and currently have four pending requests from transportation agencies. TSA and CISA are collaborating or planning to collaborate on several passenger rail cybersecurity assessments, including a cyber risk assessment for passenger rail cars and a cyber assessment of the mass-transit and passenger-rail mode. TSA has taken initial steps to share cybersecurity key practices and other information with domestic rail stakeholders, but does not fully incorporate the updated cyber key practices presented in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, which provides a high-level, strategic view of the life cycle of an organization's management of cybersecurity risk. TSA officials noted that the agency's cybersecurity efforts are still in the early stages and that the implementation plan for the 2018 Cybersecurity Roadmap, which calls for improving information sharing and partnering with stakeholders to promote the adoption of best practices and industry and/or international standards, was only recently signed in September 2019. In addition, TSA's National Infrastructure Partnership Program (NIPP) states that officials should share actionable and relevant information across the critical infrastructure community to build awareness and enable risk informed decision making. TSA participates in the American Public Transportation Association's (APTA) working groups that review and develop standards and recommended practices for domestic rail security, including those that apply to intermodal station security and cybersecurity. TSA is listed as a participant in 37 of the 45 documents produced by APTA from 2009 through 2019, including standards, recommended practices, white papers, and white papers on physical infrastructure protection at passenger facilities. TSA provides limited guidance to TSARs on how to engage with foreign surface transportation stakeholders, including rail, but has focused its guidance on aviation, which includes foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections, and deferring to the individual initiative of each TSAR on how or whether to engage. TSA does not provide specific guidance on surface transportation, but TSA's new Regional Operational Implementation Plans provide an opportunity for TSA to more clearly incorporate targeted guidance to encourage TSAR outreach and information sharing in specific areas.
The federal government has had difficulties acquiring, developing, and managing information technology (IT) investments. Historically, federal agencies have struggled with appropriately planning and budgeting for modernizing legacy systems; upgrading underlying infrastructure; and investing in high quality, lower cost service delivery technology. As a result, agencies have relied on legacy systems that have become increasingly obsolete and vulnerable to security and performance issues. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' efforts to modernize their legacy systems. This report (1) identifies the most critical federal legacy systems in need of modernization and evaluates plans for modernization, and (2) identifies examples of IT legacy system modernization initiatives in the last 5 years that agencies considered successful. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, reviewed agency modernization plans for 10 of the 65 most critical legacy systems identified by the agencies, and interviewed agency officials about their modernization plans. The 10 most critical systems GAO identified are maintained by 10 federal agencies whose missions are essential to government operations, such as emergency management, health care, and wartime readiness. These legacy systems range from about 8 to 51 years old and, collectively, cost approximately $337 million annually to operate and maintain. Further, several of these systems are operating with known security vulnerabilities and unsupported hardware and software. For example, in November 2017, the Department of Education's Inspector General identified security weaknesses that included the department's use of unsupported software that put its sensitive information at risk, including the personal records and financial information of millions of federal student aid applicants. The majority of federal agencies lack complete plans for the modernization of these 10 critical systems. According to GAO's review of government and industry best practices for modernization of federal IT, agencies should have documented modernization plans that, at a minimum, include three key elements: milestones to complete the modernization, a description of the work necessary, and details regarding the disposition of the legacy system. However, of the 10 agencies with critical systems most inneed of modernization, seven (DOD, DHS, Interior, Treasury, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and SSA) had documented plans for their respective legacy systems and three (Education, HHS, and Transportation) did not have documented plans. Of the seven agencies with documented plans, DOD and Interior had plans that addressed each of the key elements. For instance, Interior submitted documentation of both completed and forthcoming milestones leading to the deployment of the modernized system, as well as a list of the mandatory requirements for the updated system, and the work that needed to be performed at each stage of the project. While the other five agencies' plans did not fully address one or more of the three elements, they partially included one or two of the elements. The agencies provided a variety of explanations for the missing modernization plans, including that Education's modernization plans were pending the results of a comprehensive IT visualization and engineering project that would determine which IT systems and services could be feasibly modernized, consolidated, or eliminated; HHS had entered into a contract to begin a modernization initiative but had not yet completed its plans; and Transportation had solicited information from industry to determine whether the agency's ideas for modernization were feasible. In addition, officials within SSA's office of the Chief Information Officer stated that the agency has yet to complete its modernization planning, even though modernization efforts are currently underway. The officials said that they will update the planning documentation and make further decisions as the modernization effort progresses. The 24 agencies identified 94 examples of successful modernizations of legacy systems undertaken in the past 5 years. The initiatives were of several types, including those aimed at transforming legacy code into a more modern programming language, migrating legacy services (e.g., email) to the cloud, and re-designing a legacy mainframe to a cloud-based application. Agencies attributed the success of their modernization initiatives to various factors, including: using automated technologies to examine programming code and perform testing; testing the system thoroughly; actively engaging the end users and stakeholders throughout the modernization process; cultivating a partnership between industry and government; following management practices on change and life cycle management (Education); developing and implementing an enterprise-wide cost collection and data analysis process for commodity IT to track and measure progress against consolidation, optimization, and savings targets (DHS); using an interface that was consistent with agile principles to create an interface across systems (SSA); having strong executive leadership and support (Treasury and
This testimony summarizes the information contained in GAO's October 2019 report, GAO-2019-10-977 . It focuses on (1) the federal government's investment in climate resilience projects and (2) the opportunities to increase the climate resilience impact of federal funding options that GAO identified in that report. GAO reviewed relevant reports and prior work, interviewed stakeholders, and reviewed two recent examples of federal investment in resilience projects in Louisiana and Canada. The federal government has invested in projects that may enhance climate resilience but does not have a strategic approach for investing in high-priority projects. For example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil works program constructs flood control projects, such as sea walls, that could convey climate resilience benefits by protecting communities from storms that may be exacerbated by climate change. However, to date, no federal agency, interagency collaborative effort, or other organizational arrangement has been established to implement an approach to climate resilience investment that includes periodically identifying and prioritizing projects. Such an approach could supplement individual agency climate resilience efforts and help target federal resources toward high- priority projects. Six key steps provide an opportunity for the government to strategically identify and prioritize projects for investment, based on our review of reports that discuss adaptation as a risk management process, on international standards, our past work (including our enterprise risk management criteria), and interviews with stakeholders. These steps include defining strategic goals, identifying and assessing high-risk areas for targeted resilience investment, identifying potential project ideas, prioritizing and implementing projects, and monitoring projects and climate risks. In our report, we used one domestic and one international example to illustrate these key steps: Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) coastal master planning effort and Canada's Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund (DMAF). In the domestic example, to address the lack of strategic coordination, in 2005 the state of Louisiana consolidated coastal planning efforts previously carried out by multiple state entities into a single effort, led by CPRA. In the international example, in 2018 the Canadian government launched the DMAF, a financial assistance program, to provide $1.5 billion over 10 years for large-scale, nationally significant projects to manage natural hazard risks, including those triggered by climate changes. As GAO reported in October 2019, on the basis of its review of relevant reports, past work, interviews with stakeholder representatives, and illustrative examples, we identified two options—each with strengths and limitations—for focusing federal funding on high- Priority climate resilient projects. The options are ( 1) coordinating funding provided through multiple existing programs with varied purposes and ( 2) creating a new federal funding source specifically for climate resilience. A strength of coordinating funding from existing sources is access to multiple funding sources for a project. A limitation of that option is that it could be administratively challenging and could require dedicated staff to identify programs, assess whether projects meet program funding criteria, apply for funds, and ensure program requirements are met. Alternatively, a new funding source could encourage cross-sector projects designed to achieve benefits in multiple sectors. In addition, a federal investment effort presents an opportunity to encourage complementary resilience activities by nonfederal actors such as states, localities, and private-sector partners. A key lesson from our Disaster Resilience Framework is that incentives can make long-term, forward-looking risk reduction investments more viable and attractive among competing priorities. As we stated in our disaster resilience framework, most efforts to reduce disaster risk are reactive, and many revolve around disaster recovery. As a result, additional strategic federal investments may be needed to manage some of the nation's most significant climate risks because climate change cuts across agency missions and presents fiscal exposures larger than any one agency can manage.
DOD uses ACSAs to exchange logistic support, supplies, and services with partners in a variety of circumstances, including international coalition efforts, such as those combating terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria. As of February 2020, DOD had signed 125 ACSAs with 125 countries and international organizations for the reciprocal provision of logistics support and supplies. Senate Report 115-262, accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019, includes a provision for GAO to review several aspects of ACSA management. This report examines the extent to which (1) agencies have provided information to Congress about ACSAs and (2) DOD has tracked and received reimbursement for ACSA orders. GAO analyzed DOD and Department of State (State) documentation related to congressional notifications and the establishment of ACSAs, DOD ACSA transaction data, and DOD's Report to Congress Concerning Acquisition and Cross-servicing Activities for Fiscal year 2018. The Department of Defense (DOD) and State have generally provided required information about ACSA to Congress, but have recordkeeping gaps and timeliness issues. Under 10 U.S.C. §2342, DOD must notify Congress of its intent to designate the government of a non-NATO country for an ACSA at least 30 days before making the designation. DOD records indicate that DOD transmitted notifications to Congress for at least 78 of the 104 countries eligible for ACSAs. For these 78 notifications, GAO confirmed that they were dated on time. However, DOD did not have records of 26 notifications for which it should have notified Congress, so GAO could not confirm whether the notifications had occurred. DOD estimates that these 26 notifications would have occurred between 1993 and 2009, with 20 being before or during 1996. According to DOD officials, DOD's ACSA recordkeeping procedures are not documented and have changed over time, which contributes to gaps in DOD notification records. Poor recordkeeping has affected DOD's ability to provide Congress with full and accurate information about ACS as required by law. State is required to notify Congress no later than 60 days after the entry into force of any international agreement to which the United States is a party, other than a treaty, as soon as practicable after the agreement has entered into force, but in no event after 60 days thereafter. Of the 118 ACSAs that had entered in force as of February 2019, State provided notification to Congress within 60 days, as required, for 68 (or 58 percent). However, 48 (or 41 percent) of the 118 notifications were late, that is, dated more than60 days after entry in force. For most of these 48 notifications, State attributed the delays to untimely DOD delivery of required information to State. For example, 74 percent of the 43 notifications that included a reason for delayed transmittal attributed the cause to DOD elements having provided late or incomplete agreement information. Without full and timely information about new partners that DOD intends to designate for anACSA or agreements that have entered into Force, Congress will not be sufficiently informed to effectively oversee DOD's use of ACS as an element of security cooperation. DOD lacks quality data necessary for tracking ACSA transactions and has not received reimbursements for thousands of orders that it authorized from October 2013 through March 2018. Specifically, based on a generalizable sample of orders in DOD's system of record for tracking and reporting ACSA support, DOD could not determine the status of reimbursement for an estimated 12.2 percent of orders (about 1,100) and could not verify the reimbursement status of an estimated 24 percent (about 2,300) of orders for which DOD had not received full reimbursement. DOD officials identified several factors that contributed to these unreimbursed orders, including a lack of invoices, delays from partner countries, and lack of a process to monitor and take action on delinquent ACSA debt. As a result, DOD does not have sufficient information to oversee ACSA reimbursement for hundreds of millions of dollars of support provided to its partners.
In April 2017 and April 2018, the Attorney General issued memoranda directing DOJ to prioritize immigration-related prosecutions along the southwest border. GAO was asked to review DOJ's implementation of these memoranda. This report examines (1) how DOJ prioritized criminal prosecutions in response to the memoranda, (2) what DHS and DOJ data from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 indicate about criminal prosecutions, and (3) the resources that DOJ, DHS, and the federal judiciary used to implement increased prosecutions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed DOJ, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and federal judiciary data on immigration prosecutions from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018, and interviewed officials in Washington, D.C., and five U.S. Attorney Office (USAO) districts—Arizona, California, California Southern, New Mexico, Texas Southern, Texas Western, and Texas Western—selected on the basis of factors such as the number of apprehensions of individuals along the border and DOJ practices for prosecuting improper entry, illegal reentry, and alien smuggling cases. DOJ and DHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Beginning in April 2017, in coordination with DHS and other stakeholders, the Department of Justice (DOJ) took steps to prioritize criminal prosecutions of individuals who entered the United States illegally, or illegally reentry after removal (illegal reentry), in accordance with an April 2017 memorandum. In particular, in five southwest border districts, all five USAOs prioritized improper entry referrals for prosecution, according to DOJ officials. For example, some USAOs changed the threshold at which they would accept a prosecution referral for alien smuggling, which involves the smuggling of an alien. In addition, in four of the five districts, USAO officials told GAO that they informed local DHS partners, including local Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Field Operations (OFO) leadership, that their prosecution guidelines had changed in light of the 2017 memorandum and that they will accept more immigration- related cases for prosecution. As a result, Border Patrol referred more immigration cases to DOJ for prosecution in fiscal years 2018 than in each of the prior four fiscal years. DOJ also prosecuted more cases for improper entry than in the four prior fiscal years, and more than half of the cases filed with a lead charge of improper entry were filed in fiscal year 2017 and 2018. In response to DOJ's prioritization of immigration prosecutions, agencies shifted existing resources and allocated additional resources to support increased immigration prosecutions. For instance, some districts added additional court staff to handle the increased number of cases, such as additional judges and attorneys, and others added additional daily dockets or court sessions to accommodate the higher volume of cases being prosecuted. In some cases, these realignments affected the extent to which prosecutors could accept all improper entry cases referred for prosecution or referred only those individuals with a criminal history. DOJ, the federal courts, USMS, and federal defenders also added personnel to support immigration prosecutions in the short and long-term, and some of these agencies tracked some related expenditures. In May and June 2018, DOJ announced plans to permanently hire 70 new Attorneys for Immigration and Border Security (AUSAs) to prosecute immigration offenses, and in May 2018, EOUSA officials told us that they subsequently received DOJ approval to hire 13 more AUSAs to work on immigration and border security issues on the southwestborder. In fiscal year 2019, EouSA estimated that the continuing personnel costs associated with these prosecutors would be about $17 million. In its fiscal year 2020 Congressional Budget Justification, DOJ requested a $23.3 million increase in funding from Congress to sustain hiring and program operations, including the immigration prosecutors, and allocate a portion of these funds to USAOs around the country with demonstrable workload challenges.
For lower-income taxpayers with pressing financial obligations, tax-time financial products can offer an alternative to higher-cost short-term products such as payday loans. GAO was asked to review the market for these products. This report (1) describes trends in the market and examines the reliability of IRS data on product usage, (2) describes characteristics of those who use these products and factors that influence their use, and (3) describes regulatory oversight of industry participants and the disclosure of information on product fees and terms. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed IRS data from 2008–2018, reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and industry reports, and interviewed federal officials and industry participants, including representatives of five banks and nine tax preparers selected based on geographic location and product offerings, among other factors. The results are not generalizable to the retail tax preparation industry. The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) data on the use of tax- time financial products for 2016–2018 do not accurately reflect product use and IRS has not updated reporting guidance to preparers, but when combined with other available data for 2008–2016 and consumer advocacy group reports suggest that product use has evolved. For example, IRS data show that in 2016, about 468,500 taxpayers filed a tax return with a refund anticipation loan and in 2017, the number appeared to spike to about 1.7 million. However, the data for these two years may be misleading because they likely conflate refund anticipation loans with refund advances. In 2018, IRS created a separate reporting category for refund advances and the 2018 data show about 356,000 returns with a loan indicator as of October 2018. The number of taxpayers who used refund transfers—which allow for direct deposit of refund checks through temporary accounts that banks open for taxpayers—far exceeded use of refund loans and refund advances since 2008, according to IRS data. In addition, available data suggest that fees for refund transfers increased in 2018. For 2018, paid preparers generally charged their customers $39.95 or $49.95 for a refund transfer that sometimes included both federal and state tax refunds. In one case, the fee was $65, which included a paper check disbursement. Taxpayers who filed their own returns online using preparer software paid an average fee of $31.13 in 2018, which was lower than the $40.95 that paid preparer fees for the refund transfer products GAO reviewed. The Department of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) oversee banks and IRS sets standards of practice for certain service providers (including some tax preparationrs). GAO's nongeneralizeable review of selected banks and preparers found that they generally followed existing OCC and IRS disclosure requirements for certain product fees, but some preparers' disclosure practices may present challenges for consumers trying to compare product options. The disclosure of fees for disbursing funds was inconsistent, particularly around prepaid cards, which are often used to disburse funds from a tax refund product. In some cases, a tax preparer will offer prepaid cards as the only disbursements option. The cards generally carry additional fees for long-term use (such as monthly, withdrawal, reload, and inactivity fees). However, only two of the seven preparers GAO visited that offered a prepaid card explained that the card could be used for transactions other than receiving the tax refund. The remaining preparers did not disclose that additional fees would apply to longterm use of the card. IRS does not have guidelines for disclosing fees for prepaid card use. The lack of consistency about the timing of fee disclosures may add to the rationale for Congress to consider legislation granting IRS the authority to regulate preparers.
FCC, FTC, and DOJ share responsibility for enforcing federal telemarketing laws and regulations related to illegal robocalls and spoofed calls. FCC and FTC each manage consumer complaint databases where consumers can file complaints about unwanted calls, such as spoofed or "spoofed" calls. FTC also enforces rules requiring telemarketers to transmit their telephone number, and when available, the name of the telemarketer, to a consumer's caller ID service. DOJ enforces federal fraud statutes under which fines or imprisonment can be imposed against anyone who uses interstate telecommunications as part of a fraud scheme. GAO was asked to review issues related to spoofing. This report examines (1) the extent to which spoofing is used to commit fraud, (2) FCC's and FTC's and DOJ's efforts to collaborate on spoofing investigations and enforcement actions, and (3) how FCC and other entities are working to reduce spoofing through consumer education and interagency collaboration. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed FCC and DOJ documents and data, and interviewed officials from FCC, DOJ, and other federal agencies, as well as industry and consumer groups. FCC, the Federal Trade Commission (FCC), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical and editorial comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Caller ID spoofing—when a caller deliberately falsifies or “spoofs” the information transmitted to the caller ID display to disguise the source of the call—is used to facilitate a variety of financial fraud and other schemes, and consumer complaints suggest a substantial increase in its use. For example, from 2015 through 2018, complaints to FCC that specifically referred to spoofed caller ID calls more than doubled and those received by FTC increased by more than four times. According to industry stakeholders GAO spoke with, there is also a growing trend in neighbor spoofing, where the caller's number is spoofed to display a phone number matching the area code and prefix (the first six digits of the consumer's phone number) of another consumer's number. These spoofed neighbor calls are often made in combination with robocalling, which is an automated telephone call that delivers a recorded message to a recipient's home or mobile phone number. FCC has taken several steps since 2013 to encourage the industry to develop a caller ID verification system to combat spoofing and block unwanted calls. In doing so, FCC's efforts have aligned with federal guidance for agency participation in private-sector standards activities to help address national priorities. The guidance states that federal engagement in standards activities should aim to produce timely, effective standards that address legitimate regulatory, procurement, and policy objectives and that the federal government should assume an active role where necessary to ensure a rapid, coherent response to national challenges. In June 2019, FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require all providers to implement the technical system if major providers fail to do so by the end of 2019. FCC's Chairman stated that FCC is prepared to issue rules in 2020 mandating that major providers implement the system if these major providers do not meet the 2019 deadline. FCC officials stated that their efforts related to these issues encompass more than what is in the proposed regulations, as FCC will continue to monitor the work of the governance authority, the progress of service providers' implementation of the system, and industry efforts to improve the system's effectiveness and address remaining technical issues. FCC also directed staff to develop two reports over the next 2 years that, among other things, provide information on the state of deployment of this system. FCC is also considering how, if at all, its role should evolve in the future, including what role FCC should have in the governance of the callerID verification system, how to encourage carriers that maintain some portion of their network on legacy technology to implement elements of the systems, and how FCC can best leverage this system to help combat illegal calls originating outside of the United States. In addition, FCC, FTC and DOJ officials identified 62 enforcement cases that they said involved spoofing or blocking of caller ID information since 2006, though DOJ officials said that their list of enforcement cases was not comprehensive because DOJ's enforcement database does not include an indicator for whether spoofing was employed as partof a fraud schemes. FTC officials told GAO that as of November 2019 the agency had brought 147 enforcement cases against Do Not Call and robocall violators and had obtained injunctive relief in all of its completed spoofing cases.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers Medicare, the nation's health care program for the elderly and certain low-income individuals. Medicare covers behavioral health services, including services for the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral health conditions, such as depression, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders (SUDs). GAO was asked to review Medicare beneficiaries' use of these services. This report examines (1) the extent to which Medicare beneficiaries with SUDs receive behavioral health care and (2) how CMS provides information to Medicare beneficiaries on coverage for behavioral health benefits. GAO analyzed CMS data on behavioral health claims filed with CMS in 2018, the most recent data available at the time of analysis; reviewed CMS documents; and interviewed CMS officials and officials from five Medicare Advantage (MA) plans selected on the basis of variation in beneficiary characteristics, among other factors. In 2018, approximately 5 million Medicare beneficiaries—about 14 percent of the more than 36 million fee-for-service (traditional) Medicare beneficiaries, or 5.5 million beneficiaries—used Behavioral Health Services (Behavioral Health Services) through Medicare Part B. This represented about $3.3 billion in spending for 39.3 million services. Nearly one-third (30 percent) of beneficiaries used one behavioral health service during the year. The 11 percent of beneficiaries who were the highest Behavioral Health Service Users used 19 or more services (the 90th percentile) during 2018, and accounted for about half of all Medicare expenditures on behavioral Health Services. The services beneficiaries received largely fell into two broad categories in 2018: general patient consultations (53 percent) and psychiatry services (43 percent), including psychotherapy. Other services (such as central nervous system assessments and drugs administered by providers) accounted for 5 percent of services. Beneficiaries were largely diagnosed with a condition in at least one of five diagnostic behavioral Health Conditions categories, each of which contain multiple specific diagnoses. In2018, 96 percent of all behavioral health Services were for a primary diagnosis within one of these five categories. For example, 42 percent of mood disorder services were provided for mood disorders, which include depression and bipolar disorder. Medicare claims data for 2018 show that some Medicare beneficiaries used behavioral Health services to obtain treatment for Suds. Seven percent of behavioral Health Service Providers: Psychiatrists, Psychologists, and Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSWs) GAO found that in 2018 two-thirds of behavioralhealth services (67 percent) were provided by psychiatrists, psychologists, and LCSWs. A range of other providers delivered the remaining one- third of services (16 percent) including advanced practice providers, primary care physicians (11 percent), other physicians (5 percent), and other providers (1 percent). CMS uses various communication and outreach approaches to provide coverage information to beneficiaries, but its annual mailing to beneficiaries does not include explicit information on Medicare coverage for SUD treatment. CMS is required by law to provide information annually to beneficiaries about their coverage, including benefits and limitations on payment. However, GAO reviewed the fall 2019 edition of the Medicare & You publication and found that it does not contain an explicit description of the services that may be covered for treatment of SUDS. CMS officials stated that the agency conducts public awareness and outreach campaigns to provide beneficiaries with information about Medicare benefits and coverage, but the publication does not provide explicit information about coverage of services for S UDs. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries may not be aware of this coverage and may not seek needed treatment. The absence of information on SUD coverage is inconsistent with HHS and CMS strategic priorities related to treatment for these conditions.
DOD conducts sustainment and maintenance on nuclear weapon systems to ensure that these systems are available to support current military operations and maintain the capability to meet future requirements. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's efforts to sustain and maintain these systems. This report examines (1) DOD's progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews and the 2015 NC3 report, and (2) challenges to the sustaining and maintenance of nuclear systems and initiatives to mitigate those challenges. GAO reviewed DOD documents and interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military services, and other DOD components. The Department of Defense (DOD) continues to make progress implementing recommendations from its 2014 and 2015 National Leadership Command, Control, and Communications System (NC3) reviews, but the key tracking tools used to provide visibility on the status of the recommendations do not provide current and complete information. For example, expected completion dates for key metrics and milestones—key methods of evaluating the department's progress—are not up to date. Additionally, the Nuclear Deterrent Senior Oversight Group is working to develop an additional approach for tracking long-term risks and opportunities to monitor the health of the defense nuclear enterprise. Current and complete and complete data and metrics for recommendations from these studies would help inform this effort. DOD and the services are experiencing challenges related to the sustainment of nuclear weapons systems and have ongoing and planned initiatives intended to mitigate these challenges. The military services face challenges to operating weapon systems beyond their initial design life, parts availability and parts obsolescence, small fleet size, and the maintenance workforce. The services are mitigating these challenges through initiatives to increase parts availability, improve depot-level maintenance, and increase tracking of sustainment problems. The Air Force and Navy have also taken steps to improve oversight of the nuclear enterprise in response to the 2014 reviews, including the establishment of an oversight body, the National Leadership command, control, and communications system (NLC3S) Council, which is responsible for oversight of NC3 capabilities. The Navy has also established an SSBN Sustainment Working Group and a Trident Planned Equipment Replacement Program Working Group to address Ohio-class sustainment-related issues. The Defense Logistics Agency has a Nuclear Support Office to synchronize resources to ensure responsive support to the DOD nuclear enterprise and has a series of new initiatives under way to increase materiel availability and accomplish activities such as paying for the cost of reverse engineering to fill in voids that exist in technical data for nuclear enterprise systems and working in additive manufacturing to set the standard for 3D printing and polymers across DOD and subsequently printing parts on demand.
FDA inspects drug manufacturing establishments to ensure that drugs marketed in the United States are manufactured in compliance with U.S. laws and regulations. In 2008, GAO found that FDA did not know how many foreign drug establishments were subject to inspection because of inaccurate information in its databases. GAO recommended that FDA improve the accuracy and completeness of this information. In 2010 and 2016, FDA took steps to improve its databases, such as using contractors to conduct site visits to verify the existence of registered foreign establishments and confirm that they manufacture the products that are recorded in import records. However, the lack of foreign inspections removes a critical source of information about the quality of drugs manufactured for the U. S. market. FDA also faces challenges when inspecting foreign establishments that raise questions about whether these inspections are equivalent to domestic inspections. This testimony is based on GAO's December 2019 testimony on FDA's foreign drug inspection program. It addresses (1) the number of FDA foreign drug manufacturing establishment inspections, (2) the extent to which FDA identified deficiencies during foreign inspections, and (3) challenges FDA faces in conducting foreign inspections. To conduct this testimony GAO analyzed FDA inspection data from fiscal years 2012 through 2018, reviewed FDA inspection reports, interviewed FDA officials, and conducted interviews with 18 foreign drug investigators. The number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspections of foreign drug manufacturers has decreased since fiscal year 2016 after several years of increases. From fiscal year 2012 through 2016, the total number of inspections increased but then began to decline in recent years, and the majority of inspections in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 identified deficiencies. FDA officials attributed the decrease in part to vacancies in the agency's foreign inspection workforce and inaccurate data used to select establishments for inspection. In December 2019, FDA officials said that the agency was trying to fill vacancies in each of these groups, but the lower staff numbers may limit FDA's ability to conduct more inspections. In addition, FDA continues to face challenges in its ability to accurately identify establishments that are subject to inspections because of data challenges GAO identified in a 2008 report. Specifically, in December 2019 GAO reported that in fiscal year 2018, FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)—the agency's office responsible for overseeing the safety and effectiveness of drugs—had 12 of 20 available slots in its drug inspection cadre, a group of dedicated investigators based in theUnited States who exclusively conduct foreign drug inspections. These investigators are expected to conduct 16 to 18 foreign inspections each year. In November 2018, the cadre had 12 investigators, out of 20 slots, and FDA officials told GAO that they were not confident that all 20 slots would be filled. The majority of foreign and domestic inspections were conducted by one person—77 percent and 66 percent, respectively—from fiscal years 2016 through 2018. In fiscal year 2017, FDA began requiring ORA investigators who conduct foreign inspections to report inspection findings to CDER for review within 45 calendar days of the inspection closeout, which is a requirement for both domestic and foreign inspections; however, adding the additional level of review within ORA effectively shortened the amount of time investigators have to document findings for foreign inspections and raised questions about the equivalence of these inspections to domestic inspection reports. For example, if a domestic investigator finds serious deficiencies on the first inspection of an overseas trip—thus indicating an initial inspection classification—the investigator needs to write and send the related inspection report to the ORA supervisor for endorsement before returning home from the 3-week overseas trip to meet the required time frame. Eight of the 18 investigators GAO interviewed said shortening the time for completing reports has made it more challenging to meet reporting requirements, especially if serious deficiencies are identified during the inspection, and one investigator said that, as a result of the time pressures, post-inspection reports may be less thorough, and that some inspection observations could be better supported if investigators had more time to write the reports. FDA faces challenges in inspecting foreign drug facilities, including challenges in preannouncing inspections, language barriers, and lack of flexibility. For instance, FDA generally does not send translators on inspections in foreign countries. Instead, investigators rely on the drug establishment to provide translation services, which can be an English-speaking employee of the establishment being inspected, an external translator hired by the establishment, or anEnglish-speaking consultant. Fourteen of 18 investigators said that there can be concerns related to relying on establishment staff and independent translators. Eight investigators said there is little flexibility to
Poverty negatively affects many aspects of a family's life, including a child's education and a parent's ability to participate in the labor force. Some state and local entities are attempting to use two-generation approaches to help families move towards economic self-sufficiency and alleviate the impact of poverty on children, adults, and families through quality programs that address the needs of both generations. GAO was asked to examine (1) what federal programs are most commonly cited by selected entities as being used to serve whole families and reduce poverty, (2) how selected entities have leveraged federal programs to support their two- generation approaches, and (3) what challenges, if any, selected entities reported facing in implementing two- Generation approaches. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from federal agencies and selected state, local, and non-governmental entities. Ten federal programs were most commonly reported by selected state or local entities as most commonly used to reduce poverty. These 10 programs are administered by the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Transportation, and the Treasury. These programs have characteristics—including the target populations, purposes, and services provided—that allow state andlocal entities to address multiple aspects of child and parent well-being, and these have implications for their two generation approaches. For example, the 10 programs generally target low-income, needy, or at-risk families. However, some of these programs have limited purposes, such as providing child care, food assistance, or job skills training, while others provide more specific supports such as increasing employment and earnings or alleviating hunger. In addition to the 10 most frequently cited federal programs, selected state and Local entities reported using over 40 other federal programs that support their families in different ways. These other programs include programs such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG). GAO found that selected entities leveraged these 10 programs in a variety of ways to meet the unique needs of their individual communities. For instance, some entities used only one of the 10 federal programs while others reported using as many as seven of the programs. To create their unique approaches to poverty reduction, selected states and localities reported involving leadership, changing policies, expanding services, modifying service delivery practices, and/or serving specific populations. Officials from 14 of the 23 selected entities that GAO interviewed reported challenges related to data sharing and a lack of information on successful two-generational approaches. Specifically, officials from 11 of 23 entities reported a need for more examples of successful approaches, opportunities to learn from peers, and information on federal funding sources that can be used to implement these approaches. Federal agencies have taken steps to assist entities interested in data sharing by providing information memorandums, webinars, and other assistance. For some efforts, HHS has partnered with other federal agencies to develop information related to two-Generation approaches. While this information may not be specific to these approaches, federal officials reported that it could be useful to entities utilizing these approaches and could help them to better serve families and break the cycle of multi-generation poverty.
The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 established the STEP program to help small businesses develop their export capacity by providing about $139 million in grants to states and territories through fiscal year 2020. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, states received about $54.1 million in STEP grant funds. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) reauthorized the program through 2020 and renamed it the State Trade Expansion Program. TFTEA requires that GAO review the program annually. This report examines the extent to which (1) the program's grants management process provides reasonable assurance of compliance with selected requirements of applicable law and (2) SBA has taken steps to address challenges states report in using grant funds to achieve program goals. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed program data; and interviewed officials from 12 states that used less than 75 percent of their grant funds in fiscal year 2015, the most recent year for which complete data were available. The Small Business Administration's (SBA) State Trade expansion Program (STEP) grants management processes do not provide reasonable assurance that STEP grant recipients meet some applicable law requirements before the grant is closed out. SBA's Office of International Trade (OIT) has a process in place to comply with the “proportion of amounts” clause of STEP's authorizing statute, which caps at 40 percent the amount of grant funds distributed to the 10 states with the largest numbers of eligible small businesses. However, GAO found that OIT does not have processes sufficient to ensure that states met the total and cash match requirements. Specifically, SBA does not document that states meet the total match requirement before grant closeout, and has not developed a process to determine whether states are meeting the cash match requirement. As a result, OIT cannot consistently determine states' compliance with this requirement, and risk closing out grants for which states have not met it. OIT officials stated in July 2018 that they planned to implement a new quarterly process to focus on match information specifically, but were unsure what this process would entail. Without a process for effectively documenting that the total matching requirement has been met and reviewing this documentation before closeout of the grant, SBI does not know if states have complied with the cash matching requirement and risks overpayment of federal funds. According to SBA officials, in response to feedback from states, O IT made some changes to the program for the fiscal year 2017 cycle, such as extending the program from a 1-year to a 2-year award period and eliminating a requirement that travel funded by STEP grants be approved at least 30 days in advance of each trip. Of the 12 states GAO interviewed, officials from 11 agreed that these changes would improve the program, but some states reported continuing challenges to using all awarded grant funds within the permitted time period. For example, one state reported that it was unable to use all of its grant funds during the first quarter of the program cycle because the award notifications occurred so close to the start of the federal fiscal year, forcing it to compress its activities into the remaining quarters. Officials from the 12 low-use states also reported challenges related to the application and award processes, administrative burden, and poor communication with and within OIT. For instance, some state officials described issues such as sometimes waiting weeks or months for responses to emails that they had sent to OIT, resulting in administrative delays or preventing states from executing some activities as planned. In addition, some states said that program rules and regulations are inconsistently communicated within O IT. OMB's recent changes to STEP could help increase future use rates; however, the effect is yet unknown because the changes were introduced for the 2017 cycle.
The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) is responsible for conducting the decennial census, which produces data that are used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives, allocate billions of dollars in federal financial assistance, and provide a social, demographic, and economic profile of the nation's people to guide policy decisions at each level of government. Given the importance of the census to the nation, it is important for the Bureau to manage risks that could jeopardize a complete, accurate, and cost-effective enumeration. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's risk management for the 2020 Census. This report examines (1) what risks to the census the Bureau has identified, (2) the risks for which it has mitigation and contingency plans, (3) the extent to which the plans include information needed to manage risk, and (4) how the approach to managing fraud risks aligns with leading practices outlined in GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant Bureau documents and interviewed Bureau officials. The Bureau identified 360 active risks—meaning the risk event could still occur and adversely impact the census—to the 2020 census as of December 2018. Of these, 30 were at the portfolio level and 330 at the program level, meaning the risk could affect the success of 35 operations that support the census as a whole, including the 2018 End-to-End Test. Of the 360 risks, the Bureau determined that 67 percent needed to be mitigated to reduce the likelihood of the risk and its impact, should it occur. For example, in July 2016 the Bureau added a risk titled, Major Disasters, to its portfolio risk register, and in July 2017 it added another risk to its program risk register. However, as GAO found in November 2012 and April 2014 that the Bureau did not have mitigation or contingency plans for all risks that required them, and GAO recommended that it develop such plans. In April 2014, the bureau provided GAO with program-level risk registers that contained both risk mitigation plans where appropriate, and it closed the recommendation as implemented. As a result, as of September 2018 the Bureau was missing required plans for both portfolio and program risks. The bureau's decennial risk management plan states that mitigation plans should be developed as soon as possible after risks requiring such plans are added to the risk registers, but it does not include a clear time frame for doing so. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should define objectives in specific terms—including the time frames for achievement—so that they are understood at all levels of the entity. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-123 states that effective risk management is systematic, structured, and timely. Without setting a time frame, some risks may not be finalized and may go without plans for extended periods, potentially leaving the census open to the impact of unmanaged risks. For the six portfolio-level risks the Bureau identified as among the “major concerns” that could adversely affect the design or successful implementation of the2020 Census, the agency's mitigation plans for these risks did not consistently include key information needed for managing them, such as activity start and completion dates and activity implementation status. In some instances, the missing information was due to the Bureau not requiring the information in the risk register descriptions. In other instances, where it did require the information, the gaps were due to Bureau officials not holding risk owners accountable for fulfilling all of their risk management responsibilities. The agency has designed an approach for managing fraud risk for responses to 2020 Census that generally aligned with the selected components of the fraud risk framework, but has not yet determined the program's fraud risk tolerance or outlined plans for referring potential fraud to the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General (OIG) to investigate, as called for in the framework. The fraud risk assessment and risk response plan, among other actions, are consistent with the component of the framework that calls for federal managers to plan regular fraud risk assessments and to assess risks to determine a fraud risk profile. In February 2019, after GAO discussed the results of its review with the Bureau, it met with the Commerce OIG to discuss potential referrals and the Bureau agreed to develop and share with the OIG a plan that outlines a potential referral process by summer 2019. Doing so will help to ensure that the strategy conforms to leading practices.
The federal government faces fiscal exposure from climate change in a number of areas, and this exposure will likely increase over time, as GAO concluded in a September 2017 report. GAO's March 2019 High-Risk List identifies Limiting the Federal Government's Fiscal Exposure by Better Managing Climate Change Risks as an area needing significant attention because the federal government has regressed in progress toward one of our criterion for removal from the list. This testimony discusses (1) federal fiscal exposure to climate change, (2) federal investments in resilience to climate changes, and (3) federal efforts to reduce this fiscal exposure. This statement is based on GAO products issued from October 2013 through March 2019, with selected updates conducted in March 2019. To update selected updates, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and other documents, and interviewed federal officials and experts. The federal government's fiscal exposure is likely to increase as the effects of climate change become more apparent. For example, in September 2017 GAO reported that the federal budget generally does not account for disaster assistance provided by Congress—which can reach tens of billions of dollars for some disasters—or the long-term impacts of climate changes on existing federal infrastructure and programs, such as flood insurance and crop insurance. In addition, in April 2018 GAO found that the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) climate change funding reports did not include funding information on federal programs with significant fiscal exposures—such as domestic disaster assistance and flood insurance—identified by OMB and others such as the National Flood Insurance Program and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. A more complete understanding of these fiscal exposures can help policymakers anticipate changes in future spending and enhance control and oversight over federal resources. Federal investments in climate-related resilience have been limited. In July 2015, the President signed into law the Climate Change Act of 2015, which, among other things, allows the President to set aside, with respect to each major disaster, a percentage of the estimated aggregate amount of certain grants to use for pre-disaster hazard mitigation and makes federal assistance available to state and local governments for building code administration and enforcement. However, it is too early to tell what impact the implementation of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA, P.L. 115-295) will have on state and Local Resilience, which was enacted in October 2018. The act could enable additional improvements at the state- and local-level, but it has not yet been implemented at the federal level. In September 2017, we reported that federal decision makers should prioritize risk management efforts on significant climate risks that create the greatest fiscal exposure, and GAO recommended that the Executive Office of the President (EOP), including OMB, work with agencies and interagency coordinating bodies to establish federal strategic climate change priorities that reflect the full range of climate- related federal activities, including roles and responsibilities of key federal entities. As of December 2018, 25 of 62 recommendations GAO has made to address climate change-related fiscal exposure remain open. In describing what needs to be done to reduce federal fiscal Exposure to Climate Change, our March 2019 high-risk report discusses many of the open recommendations. Implementing these recommendations, including those highlighted below, identify key government-wide efforts needed to help plan for and manage climate risks and direct federal efforts toward common goals such as improving resilience.
The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) high-cost program provides support to carriers that provide telecommunications services in areas that carriers would otherwise not serve and where there is no competition from other providers. These are typically rural or remote areas where the customer base is relatively small and the cost of installing infrastructure is high. The program is intended to offset the carriers' higher costs, thereby allowing them to provide services and rates that are reasonably comparable to those that consumers in lower-cost--generally urban--areas receive. FCC has adopted several reforms to improve the accountability and transparency of the program. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to address fraud risks in the high- cost program. This report examines (1) the extent to which FCC has implemented fraud-risk management leading practices for the program, and (2) how FCC's reforms are intended to improve accountability for rate-of-return carriers. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FCC documents, interviewed FCC officials, and interviewed stakeholders from federal and state government, industry, and accounting firms. FCC and its Office of Inspector General (OIG) have taken steps to manage fraud risks, but its efforts do not fully align with leading practices in GAO's fraud risk framework. In particular, FCC has not established a structure with a dedicated entity to lead fraud risk-management activities, as called for by the framework. FCC officials told GAO that FCC's existing antifraud activities are adequate and that the program's risk of fraud is low. However, FCC does not have a fraud risk assessment tailored to the program and has not identified and assessed the fraud risks that stakeholders GAO interviewed described as inherent to the high cost program, such as the complexity of its cost-accounting process and oversight challenges. Without such an assessment, FCC would have greater assurance that it is producing reliable cost estimates and would be better positioned to determine whether to make its use mandatory. FCC also has not designed and implemented an antif fraud strategy for the high costs program. FCC's Office of the Inspector General has expressed significant concerns about improper payments made to carriers under the program in recent years and about the effectiveness of FCC's audit processes in helping to prevent improper payments to these carriers. FCC, in various orders, has adopted a number of funding and other reforms intended to enhance carriers' accountability for program support, but not all reforms are mandatory. For example, FCC developed a model-based support mechanism that is designed to provide a level of support based on modeled forward-looking costs and revenues of an efficient carrier to serve an area with voice and broadband Internet. FCC allows carriers to choose which funding mechanism is best suited for their company and does not require carriers to use the model. According to FCC, as of September 2019, there were approximately 437 study areas served by carriers receiving support through this mechanism (or almost 60 percent of all 1,078 carriers' study areas). FCC officials said the model's use is not mandatory because some carriers do not believe that the model would accurately reflect their specific costs. FCC did not have plans to assess the accuracy of the model or require its use because FCC was still in the process of evaluating next steps. Such an assessment would enable FCC to demonstrate its validity and reliability in accounting for the costs of broadband deployment. Federal internal-control standards state that management should use quality information to make informed decisions and evaluate program performance in achieving key objectives. Furthermore, according to FCC's strategic plan, FCC must ensure its programs are well managed, efficient, and fiscally responsible, and the National Broadband Plan says that FCC should move carriers to incentive-based regulation mechanisms. Yet because a substantial number of study areas--437--continue to receive traditional cost-Accounting support, and carriers cannot be effectively audited, significant fraud risks remain for this program. By assessing the model and making it mandatory, FCC could better ensure it is addressing and strategically targeting the most significant program fraud risks.
FDA inspects establishments that manufacture drugs for the U.S. market to ensure that they meet the same statutory and regulatory requirements as those manufactured in the United States. FDA inspects both domestic and foreign establishments to ensure drugs are produced in conformance with applicable laws and regulations, including current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations. GAO was asked to review FDA's oversight of foreign drug manufacturing establishments. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing review of FDA's foreign drug inspection program. It addresses the extent to which FDA (1) has assessed its oversight of drugs manufactured overseas and the steps it is taking to mitigate any risks, (2) has identified deficiencies during foreign inspections, and (3) faces challenges in conducting foreign inspections that raise questions about their equivalence to domestic inspections. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed FDA data on foreign and domestic drug manufacturing establishment inspections from fiscal years 2012 through 2018, reviewed FDA documents, interviewed FDA officials, and interviewed 18 FDA investigators who conduct foreign inspections. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted approximately 64 percent of the 5,844 foreign inspections GAO reviewed in fiscal year 2018 and identified deficiencies in about 64 percent (3,742 of 5, 844) of these inspections, according to preliminary data GAO obtained from FDA. The number of FDA foreign drug inspections increased from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, but then began to decline in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. FDA officials attributed this decrease to vacancies in the number of investigators available to conduct inspections and to inaccurate data used to select establishments for inspection. In fiscal year 2015, the total number of foreign inspections surpassed domestic inspections for the first time since GAO last reported on this issue in 2008. From fiscal years 2016 to 2018, both foreign inspections and domestic inspections decreased—by about 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively. FDA has taken steps to improve the accuracy and completeness of information it maintains about foreign establishments, but data challenges GAO identified in its 2008 report continue to make it difficult for FDA to accurately identify establishments subject to inspection. Specifically, since 2017, FDA has pursued an initiative to inspect approximately 1,000 foreign establishments that lacked an inspection history and, as of November 2019, officials said all of these establishments had either been inspected or were determined to not be subject to inspections. However, officials told GAO that this effort contributed to the decline in the numbers of inspections conducted because of how data inaccuracies affected the process for selecting establishments to be inspected. Specifically: After selecting uninspected foreign establishments for inspections, FDA determined that a sizeable percentage of these foreign establishments were not actually subject to inspectors' scrutiny (e.g., about 40 percent of those assigned to the China Office in fiscalyears 2017 and2018). These foreign establishments had no inspection history, and thus were removed from the list for inspection for the given year. The next highest priority establishments identified through the risk-based model to replace those establishments were domestic establishments. As a result of this change in the list of establishments inspected, FDA's number of inspections of foreign establishments actually decreased. As part of its ongoing work to examine the accuracy of information FDA maintains on foreign establishments and the application of its risk- based site selection process, which is intended to identify those establishments that pose the greatest potential public health risk should they experience a manufacturing defect. FDA continues to face challenges when inspecting foreign drug establishments—as compared to domestic establishments—that raise questions as to the equivalence of the two inspections. For example, FDA generally does not send translators on inspections in foreign countries. Rather, investigators rely on the drug establishment to provide translation services, which can be an English-speaking employee of the establishment being inspected, an external translator hired by the establishment, or a consultant hired by an establishment. GAOs preliminary work indicates that the overseas travel schedule can present unique challenges for FDA's domestically based investigators—including both the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) investigators and members of the dedicated foreign drug cadre—who conduct the majority of foreign inspection work. For instance, eight of the 12 dedicated foreignDrug Cadre investigators that GAO interviewed said that there is little flexibility to extend foreign inspections because the inspections they conduct on an overseas trip are scheduled back-to-back in 3-week trips that may involve three different countries. In contrast, inspections conducted by in-country investigators in China or India are generally scheduled one at a time and can thus more easily be extended if the investigator needs
Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances health care for certain low-income individuals and families through federal and state budgets. In fiscal year 2016, the federal government spent over $400 billion on Medicaid, including over $200 billion on demonstrations, which allow states to test changes to their Medicaid programs that could have significant effects for beneficiaries and other stakeholders. As of November 2018, a total of 43 states operated at least part of their Medicaid program under demonstrations, and federal spending under demonstrations represented over 30 percent of all federal Medicaid spending in 2016. GAO was asked to review CMS's oversight of demonstrations. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which CMS's policies and procedures for ensuring transparency in approving new demonstrations and extensions of existing demonstrations are consistent with transparency requirements, and (2) how CMS has used public input in approving states' applications for amendments to existing demonstrations. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed CMS documents and interviewed CMS officials. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicaid program, has developed procedures to improve the transparency of demonstrations approved by states under Medicaid Section 1115, but weaknesses remain in these procedures. In 2012, CMS issued regulations requiring states to seek public input prior to submitting an application for a new demonstration or extension of an existing demonstration. These regulations also require states to conduct evaluations to assess whether their demonstrations are achieving the state's goals and objectives and to report those outcomes to CMS periodically. CMS reviews the submitted application to check for compliance with these requirements, before seeking additional public input through a 30-day comment period at the federal level. CMS also has discretion to engage in additional transparency activities on a case-by-case basis. For example, in January 2018, CMS began providing a high-level summary and response to public comments in the demonstration approval letters it sent to states. In addition, CMS's website contains a record of key decisions and documents for each demonstration, including CMS's approvals, denials, and decisions about the completeness of applications. CMS officials told GAO that they include additional documents as standard practice, though they are not required to be posted, such as a fact sheet on the demonstration and other official communication between the agency and the state, to support transparency. CMS has not applied a consistent approach to ensuring transparency for two states that made major changes to demonstration applications mid-review. Indiana and Kentucky submitted changes to pending applications that had substantial potential effects for some beneficiaries. Indiana's changes included adding new eligibility requirements and Kentucky's included accelerating the effective dates of new requirements to maintain eligibility. However, CMS did not require either state to solicit public input, though both states opted to hold a public comment period on the proposed changes concurrent with CMS's review. Further, CMS reviewed Indiana's proposed changes against limited transparency requirements but did not do so for Kentucky. As a result of these and other weaknesses in CMS's procedures, the agency may not be positioned to mitigate any potential risks in the demonstrations being amended or when other states request to test similar policies in the future. CMS reviewed state descriptions of issues raised during the state public input process and the states' response as part of its application review. For six of the seven approvals for which GAO conducted in-depth reviews, CMS summarized themes from the comments that were received and included states' responses to these comments. The level of detail in the summaries varied, ranging from bulleted lists identifying and detailing common themes in support, opposition, or both, to a few brief sentences covering all comments. This variation often reflected the differences in the number of comments received and the significance of the concerns raised. In some cases, CMS approved changes to certain aspects of the demonstrations that were in line with concerns raised by the comments, but in other cases it did not. CMS's rationale for those decisions varied across demonstrations. For instance, CMS noted in one instance that sufficient controls were planned to address concerns raised, and in another instance it noted that the potential benefits of the demonstration outweighed the risks. For the four demonstration approvals GAO examined where public comments raised concerns—approvals for Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, and Massachusetts— GAO observed instances where CMS added specific monitoring requirements to the STCs that aligned with these concerns and other cases where the agency did not (see fig.).
DOD's installations rely on billions of gallons of water to operate and conduct their missions, but critical installations are at risk of water scarcity, and the risks are only projected to increase. GAO was asked to review DOD's management of water resources at military installations. This report evaluates the extent to which DOD has assurance that it is using reliable information to identify installations at risk for water scarcity. To do this, GAO reviewed six DOD assessments conducted from April 2017 through January 2019 that identified installations at risks of water scarcety. These assessments were conducted by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the three military departments (Air Force, Navy, and Army). GAO also interviewed DOD officials and visited a nongeneralizable sample of 17 installations that were identified in OSD's assessments as being at risk. The results of these visits cannot be used to make inferences about all DOD installations, but provide valuable insights about how water is being used by these installations for their mission-related activities and whether water scarcity had affected or was expected to affect their activities. The Department of Defense's (DOD) does not have assurance that its assessments are using accurate and reliable information regarding which installations are vulnerable to water scarcity because of substantial differences in the methodologies used to conduct the assessments. The six assessments conducted by OSD and the military departments identified a total of 102 individual installations as being vulnerable, but GAO found that they varied markedly in their results regarding which installation was identified as at risk, raising questions about which source of information DOD is using to determine which installations should be considered at risk to manage water resources across the department. For example, only one installation was included in all three OSD assessments and the applicable military department assessment. An OSD official told GAO that the assessments constitute the best DOD information available on installations atrisk of water shortages, but the assessments do not align with leading practices for identifying and analyzing water scarcity--practices that contribute to a reliable assessment of water availability. In contrast, the military department assessments do align with these leading practices, but OSD officials disagree as to whether these assessments can and should be used as the basis for determining which installations across the defense enterprise should be assessed. As a result, DOD cannot be assured that it has reliable information for water resource management and risks potentially using or providing to Congress unreliable information. The military departments rely on water at installations to conduct and support their missions. According to military department officials, water is necessary to operate missions such as rocket launches for cooling and for noise and fire suppression, to maintain temperatures to properly store equipment such as parachutes, and for firefighting training. In 2018, there were nine rocket launches at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. OSD officially reorganized its acquisition organization on January 31, 2018, in response to Section 901of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which requires DOD to reorganize its acquisition organizations. Under this reorganization, responsibilities for energy, installations, and environment were transferred to the newly created Office for the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment in 2018. Within this office, two deputy assistant secretaries are responsible for water resources management in general, and one is responsible for overseeing planning for water at the installation level.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, under education programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance, including federally funded grant programs at educational institutions, such as universities. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' efforts to address sexual harassment at universities. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which the five agencies GAO reviewed—DOE, HHS-NIH, NASA, NSF, USDA, DOE, and USDA-NIFA—conducted required Title IX compliance reviews, (2) how these agencies have addressed sexual harassment of university grantees, and (3) how the agencies have taken steps to address the culture and climate for women in STEM. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed agency documents and interviewed officials from these five agencies, as well as officials from two universities and one university system. All five agencies—the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF)—conducted periodic compliance reviews as required by federal laws and regulations from fiscal years 2015 through 2019, and three agencies completed joint compliance reviews. Two agencies publicized promising practices from their compliance reviews on their websites and did so to assist all grantees. However, the other three agencies have not clearly publicized such practices. For example, DOE has posted reports of its compliance reviews but no list of promising practices. As a result, grantees who want to learn from other universities would need to review individual compliance reports and search for these practices. DOE does plan to develop a publication that identifies promising practices and lessons learned in fiscal year 2020, according to officials. USDA is planning to create mechanisms to publicize best practices, but it has not yet done so. In October 2019, HHS updated its Title IX webpage to include a section dedicated to sexual harassment that includes a written resolution agreement between HHS and a university grantee that resolved findings of sex-based harassment. While a dedicated webpage for sexual harassment is a positive step, HHS's webpage includes promising practices of other federal agencies—Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and NSF—but not HHS. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, management should use quality information to achieve its objectives. Without clearly publicizing promising practices to the broader grantee community, DOE and USDA are missing an opportunity to provide grantees with quality information about how best to ensure compliance with Title IX requirements and reduce the likelihood of sexual harassment. The five agencies varied in their efforts in addressing sexual harassment allegations, including: 1) finalizing procedures for processing Title IX complaints; 2) communicating complete information about the complaint process to grantees; 3) addressing allegations outside of the Title IX process; 4) investigating complaints; and 5) reviewing concerns of sex discrimination—including sexual harassment—outside of the formal complaint process. Four agencies received three or fewer formal complaints of Title IX violations from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2019. Two of these agencies do not have written procedures for the prompt processing and disposition of formal complaints, and one agency does not have clear guidance for grantees on the basics of the complaint filing processes—such as who can file. Additionally, two agencies have gone beyond the formal Title IX complaint process and also reviewed sex discrimination concerns—including sex harassment—as a means of improving agency Title IX oversight of university grants, but do not share this information with each other. Establishing clear goals and an overall plan can help agencies assess progress and manage change. Although all five agencies have established a variety of prevention efforts, they have done so without a plan, and without methods to evaluate their policies and how they communicate them. Without such a plan and methods to regularly monitor and evaluate all of their efforts, the agencies may not be well positioned to effectively coordinate and integrate such efforts.
DOD has reported that more than a decade of conflict, budget uncertainty, and reductions in force structure have degraded military readiness. In response, DOD has made rebuilding the readiness of the military forces a top priority. GAO has ongoing work assessing DOD's progress in achieving its overall readiness goals in each of five warfighting domains: ground, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. This testimony discusses the Army's progress and challenges in (1) developing new warfighting concepts and modernizing equipment, (2) increasing personnel and force structure, (3) meeting authorized end strength, (4) filling key skills shortages, and (5) managing personnel time away from home. This statement is based on GAO's prior and ongoing work issued from 2016 through 2019 on Army readiness, including selected updates conducted in January 2019. The Army is in the process of updating and developing new concepts and equipment to deal with a future environment that will be increasingly lethal, competitive, complex, and dynamic. It anticipates that it will have to contend with a resurgent Russia and a rising China, as well as regional challenges from North Korea and Iran. In December 2018, the Army published a new Army Operating Concept that is specifically designed to deter and defeat China and Russia, and addresses large-scale ground combat. The concept emphasizes that the Army must demonstrate its readiness to conduct multi-domain operations as a key part of deterring adversaries from escalation. To support its readiness for future missions in this complex environment, it has begun to update or upgrade multiple weapon systems, such as long-range precision fires and next generation combat vehicles, but faces challenges in maintenance timeliness and managing its modernization efforts. In 2016, GAO reported that the Department of Defense's (DOD) Army was planning to reduce its end strength from a high of about 1.11 million uniformed personnel in fiscal year 2011 to an end strength of 980,000 by fiscal year 2018, but that at this level it could execute the National Defense Strategy, but at significant risk. Army leadership testified in March 2015 that if there were further end strength reductions the Army would not be able to execute the defense strategic guidance. After this report, Congress partly reversed these planned reductions by authorizing end strength increases in fiscal years 2017 through 2019. However, in three of the past four years the Army has fallen short of its overall end strength authorizations. Army officials told GAO that these differences from authorized end strengths fall under the Secretary of Defense’s authority to reduce the end strengths by a certain amount. Moreover, these officials added that in 2015 and 2016 the Army was drawing down end strength and planning further reductions. In January 2019, the Chief of Staff of the Army stated in a speech that the goal of Army leadership is to fill operational units to 100 percent by the end of fiscal year 2019, and 105 percent in 2020. In addition to challenges in meeting its end strengths, the Navy and Marine Corps face challenges in filling and maintaining key skills in a number of areas, and in managing the time Army personnel spend away from their home station. Both of these challenges can negatively affect readiness. For example: Accelerated activation of Security Force Assistance Brigades led to manning challenges in December 2018. Army headquarters officials said they are exploring options to address the challenges. Army depots have had difficulty filling and maintain critical skills in their workforces. Army has had difficulty manning its ballistic missile defense units. In October 2017, Army officials stated that the high aptitude standards and specialized nature of operating Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems reduced the number of eligible recruits. High personnel tempo—the amount of time that individual service members spend on official duties—has been a persistent challenge for the Army, and GAO found that personnel tempo data collected by DOD was incomplete.
GSA's existing telecommunications contracts are set to expire in May 2023. In November 2018, GSA announced that it would extend two of these contracts through May 31, 2023, for an estimated total of $20 billion. GAO was asked to review GSA's transition of its telecommunications services to EIS. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which selected agencies plan to transition their telecommunications services before the current contracts expire, (2) the steps the selected agencies have taken to implement established transition planning practices, and (3) the status of the 19 selected agencies' plans for transitioning to Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS). This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing review of transition planning for GSA telecommunications contracts. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from GSA, federal agencies, incumbent telecommunications contractors, and EIS contractors. Based on its ongoing work, preliminary results indicate that the 19 agencies GAO selected for review have varied plans for, and are in different stages of, transitioning from their current telecommunications contracts to enterprise infrastructure solutions. Specifically, as of November 2019, 8 of the agencies reported that they planned to finish their transitions to Enterprise infrastructure solutions by the General Services Administration's (GSA) September 30, 2022, milestone. The 11 remaining agencies did not plan to complete their transitions by that date. In addition, the agencies varied in the planned scope and amount of effort that is expected to be required to fully transition to E IS. For example, one agency planned to release 54 EIS fair opportunity solicitations, while the other 18 planned to issue between one and six solicitations. The remaining agencies planned to complete the transitions before the contracts expire in 2023 or after, depending on when all contract options are exercised. The five selected agencies had taken steps to implement the five transition planning activities that GAO identified in a June 2006 report, but none had fully implemented any of the practices. All five agencies had partially implemented the first transition planning practice--to develop an accurate inventory of telecommunications assets and services. However, none of these agencies had completed this activity. For the remaining four practices, all five agencies partially implemented three of the four activities associated with the first practice, and one agency fully implemented the fourth, to identify the level of funding needed to support transition planning. All the agencies had begun to develop the third practice, to develop a structured management approach for the telecommunications transition. Four agencies had fully, but not fully, implemented this activity by establishing transition management teams, and none of the other four agencies had defined all key roles and responsibilities for their transitions. The selected agencies also partially implemented two of the remaining three practices--to identify the organizational need for investments and justify resource requests, and to develop transition communications plans in order to facilitate information sharing during transition planning and execution. All of the selected Agencies had begun developing transition plans, but these plans were not complete. In particular, three agencies had not identified transition objectives and associated measures of success that could be used to determine success at the completion of the transition (e.g., all planned services have been transitioned), and the remaining two agencies had developed transition plans that did not include transition objectives. The agencies also had not developed transition time lines with clearly defined transition preparation tasks and time lines that took into account the agency's mission critical systems, contingency plans, and identified risks. Officials from all the agencies generally said that they had not yet developed complete time lines because they were focused on other acquisition planning activities, such as developing their enterprise information technology (IT) task orders. While agencies' lack of issued EIS task orders contributed to delays in developing complete plans, the limited time remaining for the transition makes it critical that agencies conduct early planning with information that is available.
HUD is responsible for ensuring that the approximately 2.5 million housing units in its rental assistance programs are safe, decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair. GAO was asked to review HUD's efforts to ensure that housing is lead-safe. This statement summarizes the findings of GAO's March 2019 report on HUD's oversight of the REAC physical inspection program, which examined (1) the extent to which HUD's inspection process and oversight of inspectors helps ensure the health and safety of housing units, (2) HUD's monitoring of compliance with lead paint regulations, and (3) the effectiveness of HUD's performance assessment and reporting on its lead-safety efforts. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed HUD documents and interviewed HUD officials. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Office of Real Estate Assistance's (REAC) Real Estate Inspections and Quality Assessments program has multiple aspects of its physical inspection process that have weaknesses. For example, REAC has not conducted a comprehensive review of its inspection process since 2001, although new risks to its process have emerged since then. REAC staff have raised concerns that some property owners have taken advantage of the scoring system and others have misrepresented the conditions of their properties. Additionally, some owners attempt to cover up, rather than address, deficiencies—such as by using mulch on a building exterior to hide erosion. HUD also has been taking steps to replace its reverse auction program with a program in which large contractors will be responsible for conducting physical inspections. HUD officials have said that a transition to the new model may take 2 years or more. HUD needs to improve a number of areas in which it needs to identify and address lead paint hazards and protect children in low-income housing from lifelong health problems, such as compliance monitoring and enforcement, inspection standards, and performance assessments and reporting. HUD began taking steps in 2016 to monitor how public housing agencies (PHAs) comply with lead paints regulations, but GAO identified several limitations with HUD's monitor efforts. HUD relies in part on PHAs self-certifying their compliance, but investigations found that some PHA officials may have falsely certified that they were in compliance. Also, on-site compliance reviews performed by HUD staff can be used to determine if PHAs are in compliance with these regulations. However, HUD performs a limited number of these reviews annually. In fiscal year 2017, HUD conducted these reviews at less than 2 percent of the roughly 4,000 PHAs. Finally, HUD does not have data readily available on the physical condition of voucher units or these units' compliance withlead paint regulations because the individual PHAs keep these data. These limitations suggest that HUD may not be fully aware of the extent that children may live in unsafe units. As of November 2019, HUD officials told GAO that PHAs continue to learn of confirmed cases of children testing positive for lead while living in HUD-assisted housing because PHAs record the cases in a HUD database. HUD's Office of Realtor Assistance has been undertaking significant changes to the physical inspection of housing, including a proposed voluntary demonstration of a new physical inspection model. HUD has also taken some steps to improve its performance assessment of its lead safety efforts, but has not fully addressed some of the recommendations GAO made in its June 2018 report. Specifically, HUD did not have comprehensive goals and performance measures for its lead reduction efforts, did not track the number of units that were lead- safe in its voucher or public housing programs, and did not comply with statutory reporting requirements.
The E-2 nonimmigrant classification helps to facilitate foreign investment in the United States, which contributes to the U.S. economy each year. State and USCIS adjudicate thousands of applications and petitions annually for foreign nationals seeking E- 2 status. GAO was asked to review State's and USCIS's adjudication processes. This report examines, among other things, (1) the outcomes and characteristics of foreign nationals who have sought or received E2 status during fiscal years 2014 through 2018, (2) State's policies and procedures to ensure that individuals meet eligibility requirements, and (3) USCIS's and State's efforts to assess and address potential fraud in the adjudication process. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data from State's Bureau of Consular Affairs, USCIS, and generalizable random samples of fiscal year 2018 adjudication data from a nongeneralizable sample of 14 posts that adjudicated at least 100 applications or petitions in fiscal year 2017, reviewed agency guidance and procedures, and interviewed agency officials at headquarters and 14 posts. The Department of State (State) and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) adjudicated an average of about 54,000 nonimmigrant visas (E-2 visas) per year from fiscal year 2014 to 2018. State accounted for over 80 percent of these adjudications. About 90 percent of State's applications were issued, and about 83 percent of petitions were approved. About 40 percent of E-1 visas were issued for investors, managers, and essential employees (i.e., those who are employed in a lesser capacity than a manager but have special qualifications essential to successful or efficient business operations) and about 20 percent for dependents (e.g., dependents of an investor, manager, essential employee, or essential employee). About 10 percent of applicants were refused for various reasons, such as not meeting eligibility requirements. About 80 percent were for nationals from nine countries: five European countries (Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain), two Asian countries (Japan and South Korea), and two North American countries (Canada and Mexico). About three-fourths of principal applicants were associated with 4 business sectors: manufacturing (44 percent), food services (13 percent), retail (11 percent), and professional services (10 percent). About 30 percent of USCIS-adjudicated petitions were for those associated with investments of $100,000 or less and 7 percent for those with investments over $10 million. USCIS and State have agency-specific guidance, resources, and training intended to ensure applicants and petitioners, respectively, meet the eligibility requirements for E2 visas. However, officials from both agencies identified challenges with respect to the adjudications process. For example, State's consular officers at 10 of the 14 posts GAO interviewed stated that E-3 visas are among the most difficult nonimmigrant visa categories to adjudicate because of the amount of supporting documentation that is required to demonstrate that both the business and applicant meet all eligibility requirements and the time required to prescreen and adjudicate the application package. Further, State officials stated that given the complexity of adjudications, additional training and resources are needed to help them better understand the eligibility requirement and supporting financial and business documents. While USCIS officials said that additional training is not necessary, providing additional training or resources would better ensure that all staff prescreening and adjudicating these visas have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to carry out their responsibilities effectively across posts worldwide. State has not developed minimum standards for company registration programs, which allow posts to assess companies against applicable eligibility requirements in order to streamline the process of adjudicating E2 visa applications. State's Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) includes requirements related to the collection of application information for all principals, including investors and managers, but GAO found that some required documents were missing from State files during its file review of E2 adjudications in fiscal years 2018. In addition, some posts have developed E-Two company registration program programs, but these programs are not mentioned in the FAM, which may result in different processing of companies and applicants across posts, as well as acceptance of varying levels of risk by posts. Establishing standards for posts that choose to implement such programs would better position State to be able to access applicant information, should it be needed for law enforcement, anti-fraud, or security purposes later. Although State
The NDAA 2017 required the Department of Defense (DHA) to modify its TRICARE contracts to ensure consistency with 13 specific elements related to improving health care delivery, such as with provider network flexibility, increased use of telehealth services, and prevention and wellness incentives, among others. The act also required GAO to review DHA's implementation of these elements. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHA has implemented the 13 elements required by the act and (2) the changes that DHA made between the T-3 and T-2017 contracts and acquisition strategy. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed DHA officials. As of January 2020, DHA had partially implemented six of the 13 required elements, but it is unclear when implementation of all elements will be complete. DHA leadership explained that they had decided that the department would separately address each of the elements through modifications to the TRICare contracts rather than developing a single strategy that would address all of them. According to DOD officials, some elements would be implemented through modifications of the TRicARE contracts while other elements would require more time to develop. For example, the act required DHA to develop and implement three value-based incentive programs in response to section 705(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2017, which requires the department to reward civilian providers with additional payments for improved performance based on certain metrics; however, the department has implemented only two of the three pilots described in its January 2018 report to Congress, and plans to implement the other two pilots over the next 6 to 18 months. The three pilots are the Performance-Based Maternity Payments Pilot, the Medication Adherence Pilot, and the High-Value Primary Care Provider Pilot. GAO also found examples of changes to the contract or acquisition process for T- 2017 that are consistent with selected acquisition themes GAO identified in prior NDAA legislation. These acquisition themes are 1) leveraging commercial best practices, 2) promoting competition, and 3) focusing on value. For T-2018 contracts, for example, contractors were required to use automation technology to process referrals and authorizations, episodes of care, and procedure diagnosis coding, among other things, to improve the quality of care for beneficiaries and reduce costs. For the T/2017 contracts, the NDAA required that contractors use industry best practices when collecting health care data in order to identify and reduce gaps in care and enhance care quality for beneficiaries. The NDAA also required contractors to develop plans with time frames and actions needed to fully implement all 13 elements by January 1, 2018. While DOD has taken steps to begin implementing some elements in its current contracts, it has not developed implementation plans that include time frames or specific actions to guide its efforts, which could help ensure that it successfully implements all of the required elements. Until these elements are fully implemented, DOD may not achieve the improvements Congress intended related to access to care, health outcomes, quality, beneficiaries' experience, and cost efficiency.
FAA is responsible for facilitating the safe integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the national airspace. UAS are aircraft that do not carry a pilot aboard, but instead operate on pre-programmed routes without the assistance of a pilot. As UAS become more integrated into the nation's airspace, they may be used for a variety of purposes, including commercial, recreational, and public safety purposes. GAO was asked to review FAA's efforts to integrate UAS. This report examines (1) the extent to which FAA has taken and planned activities to expand the use and types of UAS in the National Airspace System; (2) how FAA allocates funding for UAS-related activities; and (3) how user fees could be used to recover the costs of FAA's UAS activities. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FAA documents, interviewed FAA officials, and interviewed UAS industry stakeholders. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has leveraged its existing regulatory and oversight framework to incrementally expand UAS operations and has identified additional areas for potential future UAS integration activities. For example, FAA is applying existing regulations and standards developed for manned aviation to allow for more complex operations of small UAS and has initiated rulemaking efforts to allow UAS to operate at night and over people in certain conditions. For some capabilities, FAA has also identified a need for research and development, including for systems to detect and avoid other aircraft and hazards. FAA has established programs to draw on private industry's resources and state and local governments, including the provision of air navigation services to help address these needs. Longer term, however, the extent of activities needed to carry out FAA's statutory role in the operation, oversight, and enforcement of established rules and systems related to UAS is still unclear. FAA tracks some current UAS costs, but does not have a process to ensure that cost information is complete and reliable for future efforts. FAA allocated a total of $104.8 million in fiscal year 2018 to fund UAS for a range of activities and obligated approximately $69.7 million for these activities, according to FAA financial data. However, FAA does not know the full extent of its costs for some of these activities because it does not track costs in this way for any other mission areas, such as air-traffic-control services. As a result, FAA may not be able to determine the full costs of its current and future activities and may not have the information needed to effectively prioritize resources. FAA's future costs are unknown due to the evolving nature of the industry, as well as key systems and technological developments that continue to evolve. In addition to costs to continue regulatory activities and safety oversight, future costs will depend on FAA's involvement in the everyday operation and oversight of systems and services related to the UAS mission and its role as a provider of these services. FAA may incur additional costs to develop future systems and regulations and to provide UAS traffic management services in the future. FAA anticipates that air traffic controllers will have a role in de-conflicting manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft in controlled airspace and could provide air-Traffic- control services to U AS in controlled air space. Once these services are operational, FAA will be better positioned to estimate its costs to inform its budget requests and plan for the future, as it has done for systems that have already been implemented. FAA will continue to incur indirect costs such as those associated with the operation and maintenance of FAA facilities and systems. FAA officials said they do not plan to conduct analysis through which they could allocate indirect costs for U AS, because FAA's appropriations and funding structure does not require them to track costs for these services in such a way. FAA and Congress may opt to recover these costs through user fees or some other mechanism, but it is too early to know which fee mechanisms would be appropriate for each activity. The Office of Management and Budget's instructions to agencies on financial-reporting requirements state that agencies should report the full cost of each program, including indirect costs, and GAO's prior work on designing user fees shows that a reliable accounting of total program cost—including indirect costs—is important to setting effective fees, as GAO has shown.
Executive Order 12898 and the 2011 MOU include eight areas that agencies' environmental justice efforts should address, as appropriate, including promoting enforcement of all health and environmental statutes in areas with minority populations and low-income populations and ensuring public participation. In 2011, 16 federal agencies signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) agreeing to work together to address environmental justice issues related to their missions. GAO was asked to testify on its September 2019 report on the implementation of the executive order. This testimony is based on that report and addresses (1) the extent to which the 16 agencies have made progress in addressing environmental justice since 2011, (2) how agencies measure progress, and (3) how the interagency working group has coordinated its activities. To do this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials from the 16 participating agencies and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). GAO also reviewed documents from the working group and interviewed EPA officials. As GAO reported in September 2019, 12 of the 16 U.S. agencies have developed environmental justice strategic plans with strategic goals, but most of the agencies have not shown clear progress toward achieving these goals and the purpose of the Executive Order on Environmental Justice. For example, of the 14 agencies that issued at least one progress report after 2011, all but the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) have not issued a progress report since 2011. The agencies' progress reports generally describe the environmental justice activities they conducted but do not include any methods to assess progress (e.g., performance measures). The executive order directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to chair an interagency environmental justice working group to provide guidance to agencies in developing their environmental justice strategies. However, EPA has not provided such guidance on methods for assessing and reporting on environmental justice progress, according to EPA officials, and EPA is still pursuing its own agency-wide performance measures. The working group's Framework for Collaboration, released in 2016, describes how it plans to provide leadership, guidance, and support to federal agencies in carrying out environmental justice programs and activities. The framework does not provide strategic goals with clear direction for the committees to carry out the functions of the order. In September 2012, based on a government-wide study, we reported that collaborative mechanisms, such as working groups, benefit from clear goals to establish organizational outcomes and accountability. The Rural Communities committee created a web page that provides links to community tools, funding opportunities, educational and training assistance, and case studies to support rural communities, and USDA compiled and launched the page in fiscal year 2017 with input and vetting from the Rural Communities Committee, accordingto USDA officials. The Working Group has developed some documents with agreed-upon goals, which is beneficial to collaboration, but none of these documents address all seven functions of an executive order, including coordinated data collection and examination of environmental justice research and studies. In addition, while EPA has taken some steps to coordinate its efforts with other agencies, it does not have a strategic focus or full participation by all the federal agencies. For instance, 11 of 16 agencies do not chair or co-chaired one of the Working Group's committees, and four have not participated in any of the committees. EPA officials said it is difficult to characterize what specific opportunities are missed because of an agency's lack of representation, but they said that nonparticipation limits the group's ability to fulfill its mandates across the entire federal government.
Since the terrorist attacks in September 2001, concerns have grown that terrorists could obtain and use radioactive material and build an RDD, or “dirty bomb,” in which radioactive material is detonated in a manner similar to a nuclear explosion. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is the principal federal agency with responsibility for regulating the commercial use of radioactive materials in the United States. Public Law 113-235 directs GAO to review NRC's security requirements for radioactive material. GAO examined the extent to which (1) NRC has assessed the risks of radioactive material to establish security requirements and (2) experts agreed that NRCs assessment of risk includes all relevant criteria for establishing security requirements. To address these objectives, GAO conducted a meeting with a broad range of experts in the field of radioactive security, including NRC, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Academies of Sciences, among others, and reviewed NRC documents and interviewed agency officials and industry representatives. When assessing the risk of an attack on a radioactive dispersal device (RDD), NRC primarily considers prompt fatalities and deterministic health effects from radiation. However, NRC does not consider socioeconomic consequences and fatalities from evacuations when determining the consequences of RDDs, which could include economic losses. NRC officials told GAO that they have been directed not to do so by the Commission. In 2016, N RCR evaluated the effectiveness of Part 37 and concluded that the rule is effective for ensuring the security of category 1 and 2 radioactive materials, but did not review the security for category 3, 4, or 5 quantities of material, which NRC considers to be the most dangerous. Experts who participated in GAOS meeting generally agreed that the risk posed by category 3 quantities of certain radioactive material, such as americium-241, is high, and that N RCr s current requirements do not adequately protect these materials from theft and use in an R DD. For example, experts said that collocation of multiple categories 3 quantities at the same facility without additional security measures does not trigger additional security requirements under Part 37. In addition, experts generally said that there are security weaknesses in the current trustworthiness and reliability process for securing radioactive material from theft, and NRC should improve its process for protecting against an insider threat. Experts also generally agreed, and studies GAO reviewed, that prompt fatalities from radiation are unlikely to occur and that socioeconomic effects and fatalities resulting from subsequent evacuations are relevant criteria to consider when determining consequences of an RDS. NRA has not required additional security for these high-risk quantities of category 3 material, and has not assessed whether other category 3 materials should also be safeguarded with additional security. By requiring additional security, and assessing whether other categories 3 radioactive materials should be safeguarding with additional measures, NRA could have better assurance that its requirements are sufficient to help ensure all high- risk radioactive material are protected from theft.
The federal government provides multiple forms of disaster recovery assistance after a major disaster has been declared, including through FEMA's Public Assistance and Individual Assistance programs, HUD's Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program, and other efforts. Through these programs, the federal government obligates billions of dollars to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments, certain nonprofit organizations, and individuals that have suffered injury or damages from major disaster or emergency incidents, such as hurricanes, tornados, or wildfires. GAO's prior and ongoing work has identified a number of challenges in FEMA's and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) efforts to respond to and recover from disasters, including challenges related to (1) recruiting, maintaining, and deploying a trained workforce, (2) the Incident Management Assistance Team program, (3) Public Assistance program staffing, (4) contracting workforce shortages, (5) assistance to older adults and people with disabilities, and (6) workforce capacity and training. This testimony is based on GAO products issued from September 2017 through September 2019, including selected updates conducted in October 2019 on FEMA's efforts to address prior GAO recommendations. These updates are based on ongoing work GAO is conducting to assess the extent to which FEMA has taken actions to address these recommendations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) experiences during the 2017 hurricanes and wildfires highlight the importance of continuing to make progress on addressing the long-standing workforce management challenges GAO has previously reported on and continues to observe in its ongoing work. For example, in September 2018, GAO reported that the 2017 disasters—hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as the California wildfires—resulted in unprecedented FEMA workforce challenges, including recruiting and maintaining a sufficient and adequately-trained FEMA disaster workforce. FEMA's available workforce was overwhelmed by the response needs caused by the sequential and overlapping timing of the three hurricanes. Further, in October 2017, at the height of FEMA workforce deployments, 54 percent of staff were serving in a capacity in which they did not hold the title of “Qualified”—according to FEMA's qualification system standards—a past challenge GAO identified. FEMA officials noted that staff shortages and lack of trained personnel with program expertise led to complications in its response efforts, particularly after Hurricane Maria. FEMA field managers also reported challenges using agency systems to ensure the availability of the right mix of staff with the right skills in the right place and time. FEMA uses a system called the Deployment Tracking System to, among other things, help identify staff available to be deployed and activate and track deployments. To help gauge the experience level and training needs of its staff, the agency established the FEMA Qualification System (FQS), which is a set of processes and criteria to monitor staff experience in competently performing tasks and completing training that correspond to their job titles. FEMA managers and staff in the field told GAO in focus group discussions that an employee's recorded qualification status was not a reliable indicator of the level at which deployed personnel would be capable of performing specific duties and responsibilities or their general proficiency in their positions, making it more difficult for managers to know the specialized skills or experience of staff and effectively build teams. We are continuing to assess these and other reported workforce challenges and plan to report our findings in spring 2020.
GAO's state and local government fiscal model simulates the sector's long-term fiscal outlook based on historical revenue and expenditure patterns and other assumptions. GAO's simulations suggest that the sector will likely continue to face a difference between revenues and expenditures during the next 50 years, as measured by its operating balance. Expenditures and revenues are both simulated to increase as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) during the simulation period. However, expenditures are generally expected to grow at a faster rate than revenues, resulting in a declining operating balance over this period. The fiscal gap is an estimate of annual changes in expenditures and in revenues that GAO suggests would be needed to maintain the operating balance equal to zero during the 50-year simulation period, which GAO refers to as the "fiscal gap." The sector could close the fiscal gap through an increase in revenues, a reduction in expenditures, or a combination of the two of sufficient magnitude. Our simulations suggest the sector would need to reduce its expenditures by 20.7 percent and increase its revenues by 4.2 percent each year to achieve fiscal balance. Health care cost growth and other factors contribute to the state andlocal sector's fiscal imbalance. Medicaid spending is a key driver of long- term expenditures. In 2018, Medicaid spending was 2.9 percent of GDP compared to 0.85 percent for other kinds of health care spending such as non-Medicaid social benefit payments and employee health benefit contributions. Excess cost growth in health care is the extent to which health care costs per capita outpace GDP growth per person. In our simulations, health care expenditures per capita are expected to increase, on average, about 0.6 percent faster than GDP per capita—referred to as excess cost growth. Other health expenditures per person are also projected to grow faster, but at a slower rate than GDP. Using these projections, our simulations show that maintaining current policies will cause the sectors expenditures to exceed its revenues and this difference will become increasingly negative over the next several decades. The rate of return on pension assets could also affect the fiscal outlook. Based on an inflation-adjusted rate of returns of 5 percent for pension assets, GAOin a sensitivity analysissuggests that state and Local Government Pension Plans pension contributionswhich are required to meet pension obligationswould need to be about 13 percent of employees wages and salaries to meet their obligations. Using a higher rate of rates of return7.5 percentunder this scenario, pension contributions would be about 3 percent of workers wage and salaries. Alternatively, if the rate ofreturn is relatively low2.5 to 7.5required pension contributions are estimated to be 24 percent of salaries. Under this scenario spending would be a higher share of GDP and the sector’s outlook would worsen as its negative operating balance would continue to grow.
Private student loans are not guaranteed by the federal government and generally carry a market interest rate, which can be higher than that of federal student loans. As of September 2018, outstanding private student loan balances made up about 8 percent of the $1.56 trillion in total outstanding student loans, according to the Department of Education. Private student loan borrowers who default on their private student loans may request that the default be removed from their credit reports, but the delinquencies leading up to the default remain on the credit report. GAO was asked to review private student student loan rehabilitation programs. This report examines (1) the factors affecting financial institutions' participation in private student rehabilitation programs, (2) the risks these programs may pose to financial institutions, and (3) the effects that these programs might have on borrowers' access to future credit. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and industry reports; analyzed data from a nongeneralizable sample of 15 private student lenders; and interviewed officials from federal banking regulators and representatives of 15 lenders, including five of the largest private student banks and two credit unions. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Act) requires that GAO report at least every 60 days on compliance with the Act's provisions on private student Loan Rehabilitation Programs. The Act also requires GAO to report on the effects of these programs on credit reporting and borrower access to credit. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)—the federal regulators that oversee most credit unions and banks that issue private loans, respectively—are tasked with approving the rehabilitation programs of their regulated entities. However, as of January 2019, none of the five banks with the largest student loan portfolios GAO contacted offered rehabilitation programs for defaulted private loans. Representatives from three of these banks said they had decided not to offer a rehabilitation program, and the other two had not yet made a final determination. In addition, officials from the federal banking regulator said that as of March 2019, no banks had submitted applications to have rehabilitation programs approved. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Federal Reserve have issued information regarding the availability of rehabilitation programs to theirregulated entities, including how they would review applications. Uncertainty exists regarding two issues with rehabilitation programs: First, some nonbank lenders are not certain that they have the authority to implement these programs. Second, the Act does not explain what constitutes a "default" for the purposes of removing information from credit reports. Without clarification from CFPB, lenders may be inconsistent in the information they remove. Variations in lenders' interpretations could affect borrowers' credit scores and credit records, which could affect how they are treated by credit providers and could also result in inconsistencies that affect the accuracy of credit reporting data. Rehabilitation programs for private loans are expected to pose minimal additional risk to banks' and credit unions' safety and soundness. According to officials from OCC, the Federal Reserve, and representatives from the major bank and credit union lenders GAO spoke with, lenders participating in rehabilitation programs would face minimal additional risks for several reasons. First, loans entering rehabilitation programs are likely to be 120 days past due and to have been charged off, and thus they would have already been classified as a loss by banks and credit Unions. OCC officials told GAO a program to rehabilitate these loans would, therefore, pose no additional risks to the safety or soundness of institutions that offer them. Second , borrowers who have successfully completed rehabilitation programs by making consecutive on-time payments have demonstrated a proven repayment record, and therefore they likely represent a better credit risk. Finally , because participation in the private loan rehabilitation program is expected to be low, its effect on the soundness and safety of financial institution lending decisions would likely be minimal. The effects that rehabilitation programs may have on credit scores, which are a measure of a borrower's creditworthiness, are not clear. For example, a credit score is a measure that credit providers use to predict financial behaviors and is typically computed using information from consumer credit reports and can help predict the likelihood that a borrower may default on a loan, file an insurance claim, overdraw a bank account, or not pay a utility bill. For borrowers who successfully complete a program, their credit score may increase, on average, by an average of 8 points, while borrowers who
Federal agencies are dependent on information systems and electronic data to process, maintain, and report essential information. The security of systems and data involved in this exchange of information is vital to public confidence and the nation's safety, prosperity, and well-being. Since federal agencies face computerized (cyber) threats that continue to grow in number and sophistication, it is imperative that such information is protected. GAO designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997 and expanded this area in 2015 to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. Federal law and policy set roles and responsibilities for protecting federal systems and managing cybersecurity risks. For example, the Federal Information Security Management Act requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to provide risk-based protections for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another entity. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for developing and overseeing implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal agencies, except with regard to national security systems. OMB Circular A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource, establishes minimum requirements for federal information security programs and assigns federal agency responsibilities for the security of information and systems. In doing so, OMB requires agencies to implement a risk management framework to guide and inform the categorization of federal information systems; the selection, implementation, and assessment of security and privacy controls; the authorization of information system and common controls; and the continuous monitoring of information systems. The four selected federal agencies in GAO's review—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—have established policies and compliance assessment programs to protect data shared with state agencies. Federal agencies may share data with one or more individual component agencies within a state, such as agencies that execute a state's tax administration, law enforcement, or human services functions. The state's responsibility for protecting data shared by federal agencies may reside within an individual state agency or it may be a shared responsibility with the state's chief information officer and chief information security officer. To protect federal data that are shared with states in the implementation of key federal and state programs, federal agencies have developed cybersecurity requirements for state agencies to follow when accessing, storing, and transmitting federal data. To do so, each of the four federal agencies had a significant number of variances in the cybersecurity requirements that they had established for protecting the data exchanged with states. Specifically, GAO identified hundreds of instances in which the four agencies either had (1) included a requirement in its cybersecurity policy that was not a requirement of the other three agencies (unique requirement); (2) established a requirement with specific, organization-defined technical thresholds that differed from at least one of the three agencies for a related control (conflicting parameters); or (3) did not fully address in its requirements the guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for associated controls and control enhancements (did not full address NIST guidelines). GAO also found that federal agencies did not coordinate to the greatest extent possible when assessing state agencies' cybersecurity requirements. For instance, CMS's security policy included 54 requirements that were not included in the other agencies' policies, while FBI's policy included 24 unique requirements and SSA's policy had three unique requirements. The selected agencies have identified various reasons for not coordinating, including that they have prioritized addressing agency-specific responsibilities from relevant laws and agency policies as well as the needs of relevant communities of interest. However, without a clear understanding of the rationale for having requirements that are unique or parameters that conflict in comparison to other agencies, it will be more difficult for these agencies to achieve consistent requirements. As a result, agencies may be placing unnecessary burdens on state officials' time and resources in responding to similar requests and inquiries.
The federal government plans to invest over $90 billion for IT in fiscal year 2019. However, GAO has previously reported that investments in federal IT have too often resulted in failed projects that incurred cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. In addition, agencies have not consistently applied best practices that are critical to successfully acquiring IT, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. As a result, federal IT acquisitions and operations remain a high-risk area. GAO was asked to testify on the status of federal agencies' efforts to address IT management challenges. This testimony is based on GAO's most recent report issued in January 2018 and addresses (1) the extent to which federal agencies have implemented prior GAO recommendations to improve the management and security of federal IT, (2) efforts to implement the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act of 2014 (FITARA), and (3) efforts by the administration to improve federal IT and strengthen the nation's cybersecurity. To do this work GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and other documents and interviewed officials from OMB, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and 24 selected federal agencies, selected to reflect a range of agency sizes, among other things. Since fiscal year 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies have made more than 3,300 recommendations to address shortcomings in managing federal information technology (IT) acquisitions, operations, and data centers. As of November 2019, OMB and agencies had fully implemented 807 (or 61 percent) of these recommendations. Agencies also have made progress in implementing other recommendations, including those aimed at implementing Chief Information Officers' (CIO) responsibilities, reviewing IT acquisitions, improving data center consolidation, and managing software licenses. For example, as of January 2019, agencies had implemented 42 of the 48 recommendations related to maintaining and analyzing a comprehensive inventory of software licenses and had reviewed and approved a total of 11 of 96 randomly selected software license agreements. In the March 2019 update to its high- risk series, which provides a snapshot of the federal government's cybersecurity posture as of March 2019, GA OMB reported that agencies still needed to complete significant work related to the management of IT acquisition and operations. In particular, agencies need to ensure that CIOs review and approve IT contracts, as required by FITARA, and ensure that acquisition offices are involved in identifying and issuing guidance on IT acquisitions. In January 2018 GAO reported that most of the 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions at these agencies. For instance, most of these agencies did not identify all of their IT contracts. In this regard, the agencies identified 78,249 IT-related contracts, to which they obligated $14.7 billion in 2016, but GAO identified 31,493 additional IT contracts with combined obligations totaling $4.5 billion, raising the total amount obligated to IT contracts by these agencies in 2016 to at least $19.2 billion. Further, many of the selected agencies also did not follow OMB's guidance, including not involving the acquisition office in their process to identify IT acquisitions for CIO review, and did not establish guidance to aid officials in recognizing IT. In contrast, only 11 of 95 randomly selected IT contracts at 10 of 22 agencies were CIO-reviewed and approved as required. The 85 contracts that were not reviewed had a total possible value of approximately $23.8 billion. In August 2018, in response to a GAO survey, the 24 selected agencies reported that they had achieved $1.94 billion in cost savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, while two agencies reported they had not achieved any savings. In April 2019, in addition to that amount, 21 agencies identified an additional $0.42 billion in planned savings through fiscal year 2018. Nevertheless, this total is about $ 0.37 billion less than OMB’s goal of $2.7billion for overall DCOI savings.
The U.S. Coast Guard is in the process of acquiring three new polar icebreakers to address capability gaps in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The Coast Guard plans to have the first polar icebreaker ready for lead ship construction by fiscal year 2023. In March 2018, the Coast Guard issued a request for proposals to award a contract for the first of the three ships in fiscal year 2019. GAO was asked to testify on the status of the polar icebreaking program. This testimony is based on GAO's September 2018 report on the polarIcebreaker program (GAO-2019-10-6 ). Specifically, it addresses (1) the extent to which the program has a sound business case, (2) the program's estimated lifecycle costs, and (3) how the program will be funded moving forward. To do this work, GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed Coast Guard and Navy officials. In September 2018 GAO found that the Coast Coast Guard did not have a soundbusiness case when it established the acquisition baselines for its Polar Icebreaker program in March 2018 due to risks in four main areas—design, technology, cost, and schedule. Prior GAO work has found that successful acquisition programs start with solid, executable business cases before setting program baselines and committing resources. A sound business business case requires balance between the concept selected to satisfy operator requirements and the resources—design knowledge, technologies, funding, and time—needed to transform the concept into a product, which in this case is a ship with polar ice breaking capabilities. Without a soundBusiness Case: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Coast Guard, and Navy must gain key acquisition knowledge before committing significant resources to the program. Prior to setting baselines, the program did not conduct a preliminary design review—a systems engineering event intended to verify that the contractor's design meets the requirement of the ship specifications and is producible—because DHS's current acquisition policy does not require programs to do so until after setting programs' baselines. This is inconsistent with GAO best practices, which state that programs should pursue a knowledge-based acquisition approach that ensures program needs are matched with available resources—such as technical and engineering knowledge, time, and funding—prior to setting a program's baselines to help ensure that requirements are defined and feasible and that the proposed design can be met within cost, schedule, and other system constraints. By not conducting a design review prior to setting the baselines in its acquisition policy, DHS's Coast Guard may have established baselines without a stable or mature design, which could result in the program overstating or understating its technical and performance risks. Technology readiness assessment: Prior to the start of construction, Coast Guard officials told GAO that the program does not need to conduct a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies—hardware and software technologies that are critical to the fulfillment of the key objectives of an acquisition program. However, the agency has not yet conducted such an assessment, which is consistent with best practices for technology readiness. The program's lifecycle cost estimate substantially adheres to most GAO cost estimating best practices; however, the estimate is not fully reliable because it only partially met the criteria for being credible. The estimate provides an overly optimistic assessment of the programs vulnerability to cost growth should risks be realized or current assumptions change. This, in turn, may underestimate the life-cycle cost of the Polar icebreaker program. The Navy only modeled cost variation in the detail design and construction portion of the programs and excluded from its analyses any risk impacts related to the remainder of the acquisition, operating and support, and disposal phases, which altogether comprise about 75 percent of the lifecyclecost. Without performing a risk and uncertainty analysis on the entire life cycle cost of three ships, it is not possible for the Navy to determine a level of confidence associated with the overall cost estimate. Moving forward, how the Polar Icebreaking Program will be funded moving forward is unclear. Of the $9.827 billion estimated for the life cycle costs of the Program, about $3 billion is for acquisition costs. From 2013 through 2018, it has received $360 million in funding—$60 million in Coast Guard appropriations and $300 million in Navy appropriations. In fiscal year 2017, the Navy and Coast Guard reprogrammed $30 million from another program for the program, and the Navy did not request any funding for fiscal year 2018. Subsequently
In 2006, the Coast Guard began an organizational change effort known as modernization to realign its mission planning and mission support functions, among other things. GAO was asked to review the extent to which this effort has been implemented. This report examines (1) how the agency modernized its organization and how it applied key reform practices to its organizational change efforts and (2) the extent that the agency has assessed its workforce needs. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed Coast Guard documents and interviewed cognizant officials at headquarters, two Coast Guard districts and two sectors collocated with them, and other Coast Guard units. The U.S. Coast Guard has taken a number of actions to modernize its organizational structure since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but has not consistently applied selected key reforms to its modernization effort. The Coast Guard reported to Congress in 2018 that it had made significant changes to its headquarters organizations and business processes and that these changes demonstrated the success of the modernization effort by developing a more effective and efficient organization. However, while officials from multiple Coast Guard offices told GAO that the changes resulted in better data and greater efficiency, they could not identify metrics or a data collection system that could demonstrate that implementation of the changes had improved effectiveness or efficiency. For example, the agency did not track implementation progress or collect data to measure progress of the effort, and did not measure employee satisfaction with the effort. Establishing a process for tracking and measuring the effectiveness of the organizational changes brought on by modernization, including measuring employee satisfaction, would better position Coast Guard to understand whether its goals have been achieved. In April 2018, the service reported that it faced challenges in meeting its daily mission demands because it was operating below the workforce necessary to meet its mission demands. The service's manpower requirements determination process is its preferred method for determining workforce needs because it identifies the workforce needed to conduct required mission activities; however, since it began implementing the process in 2003, it has completed assessments for only 6 percent of its 58,000-person workforce. Further, for those positions with which it has used the determination process, it did not consistently do so in accordance with Coast Guard guidance. For instance, while required by guidance, it does not track the number of assessments and determinations completed. In its April 2018 Manpower Requirements Plan to Congress, the Service set a goal for using the manpower requirement determination process to identify staffing needs for all positions in all units, but does not have information on the resources it would need to do so. By updating its manpower requirements plan to include time frames and milestones for completing determinations for all unit types and completing assessments for its entire workforce, it will be better positioned to track progress toward its goal and make necessary adjustments in its planning, as needed. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with GAO's recommendations.
The General Services Administration (GSA) spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on major construction projects to provide tenant agencies with new buildings and modernized spaces that help support agencies' missions and enable the effective delivery of government services. GAO was asked to review GSA's oversight of construction projects. This report examines (1) the cost and schedule of GSA construction projects, (2) the extent to which GSA uses project management tools to monitor construction projects' performance, and (3) the steps GSA has taken to assess whether projects have met project requirements and capture or share lessons learned. To address these objectives, GAO judgmentally selected five case-study projects that were substantially completed between fiscal years 2014 through 2018 representing diversity in project type, geographic area, building-type, and range in cost and scope. These five projects were selected based on a variety of factors, including cost, schedule, and project type. For each case study, GSA provided GAO with extensive project documentation to obtain key information such as on contract award amounts and modifications that resulted in changes to the project's original budget or schedule. The contract modifications GAO discusses for each project are examples of modifications that added cost or credit to the final contract value or changed the delivery schedule; however, these modifications do not necessarily include all the modifications to the construction contract. In addition, we interviewed relevant stakeholders, such as GSA project managers, contractors, and facility managers who were involved with the projects. According to GSA data, from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018, the GSA substantially completed 36 major projects at a total cost of about $3.2 billion. The cost of these projects ranged from about $21 million to $343 million, with an average cost of $89.3 million. Project durations ranged between about 12 months and 79 months. R&A projects made up the majority of projects (64 percent), and new construction projects accounted for 36 percent. GSA officials and a GSA internal construction-cost study prepared for GSA by the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) in March 2016 identified several factors that can result in higher costs for the agency's construction projects compared to other similar private sector projects, including design and procurement requirements specific to federal projects that private sector counterparts may not have to comply with, among other things. The agency uses three principal tools— project management plans (PMP), peer reviews, and “earned value management” (EVM)—to monitor its construction projects’ performance, but the agency’s public reporting provides limited insight into project costs and schedule changes. The PMP is the overarching tool GSA and its contractors use to guide projects' implementation. In all of the five case study projects GAO reviewed, the associated PMPs generally: outlined the project”s scope, cost, and schedule information; identified GSA“s project stakeholders—such as project manager and contracting officer—and representatives for the tenant agencies that the project will benefit; and identified potential risks posed to the delivery of the project. For example, one of the four peer review reports noted that the safety record was exceptional, tenants were better informed, and security issues had been streamlined, allowing the contractor to staff the project in a timely manner. The third tool, EVM, is an industry-recognized project management tool that is required for major federal acquisitions such as construction projects and is used to help project managers monitor costs and schedules during project execution. Accordingto the Office of Management and Budget's guidance and GAO's cost-estimating guide, by tracking differences between the planned and actual cost of work accomplished in a given period and the actual cost and time to complete the work, EVm can provide warning signs of impending cost overruns or schedule delays and provide estimates of anticipated costs at completion. GA OMB also states that agencies should conduct Post Occupancy Evaluations (POEs) on completed projects to ensure that each asset is evaluated consistently to identify any marked successes or notable problems, including any issues that are recurring. However, in the 4-year period from 2014 to 2017, GSA did not conduct any POEs on its completed major projects, as called for by OMB guidance, and it does not have a specific policy for conducting POEs or for selecting completed projects for POEs. Instead, it contracted with NIBS to conduct six POEs and seven additional POEs in fiscal year 2019. While G
In April 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released its most recent tax gap estimate, stating that taxpayers should have paid an average of about $2.5 trillion dollars per year in federal taxes for tax years 2008 to 2010. Of this amount, IRS estimated that taxpayers voluntarily and timely paid about 81.7 percent, leaving $458 billion in unpaid taxes per year. The tax gap is an aggregate estimate of the five types of taxes that IRS administers—individual income, corporation income, employment, estate, and excise taxes. For each tax type, IRS attempts to estimate the tax gap based on three types of noncompliance: (1) underreporting of tax liabilities on timely-filed tax returns; (2) underpayment of taxes due from timely- filed returns; and (3) nonfiling, when a taxpayer fails to file a required tax return altogether or on time. GAO was asked to testify on its recent report on the federal tax gap. This testimony is based on GAO's past work on IRS's tax gap estimates and other related issues. For that report, GAO analyzed IRS data on individual income tax returns filed from 2008 through 2010, reviewed IRS documents, and interviewed IRS officials. For its report on tax expenditures—tax credits, deductions, exclusions, exemptions, deferrals, and preferential tax rates estimated by the Department of the Treasury to reduce tax revenue by about $1.38 trillion in fiscal year 2018—GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed officials from IRS, other federal agencies, and the private sector. For this testimony, which is based primarily on prior GAO work, this work was updated to reflect IRS's fiscal year 2019 budget request and additional information GAO obtained from IRS. IRS's overall approach to reducing the tax Gap consists of improving services to taxpayers, and enhancing enforcement of the tax laws. In spite of these efforts, the percentage of taxpayers who pay their taxes voluntarily and on time has remained relatively constant over the past three decades. For example, in fiscal years 2008 and 2010, the average number of returns filed with IRS for individual income taxes decreased by less than 1 percent, while the average amount of tax owed by taxpayers decreased by about 1 percent. However, the rate of individual returns audited has declined between fiscal years 2011 and 2018. IRS also faces increasing responsibilities, such as implementing relevant aspects of Public Law 115-97, which included significant changes to corporate and individual tax law. In addition, IRS faces ever-evolving and significant challenges protecting taxpayer information, preventing identity theft and fraud, and modernizing an aging technology infrastructure. In light of these challenges, it is important for IRS to focus its resources on areas where it can most effectively address noncompliance, including areas where there is little or no third-party information reporting and where it must rely on more resource-intensive methods such as correspondence or face-to-face examinations to address noncompliant taxpayers. In recent years, IRS's budget has declined by about 18.8 percent, and its budget for 2019 is less than its fiscal year 2000 budget, after adjusting for inflation. In fiscal year 2011, IRS staffing fell from 95,544 full-time equivalent employees to an estimated 75,676, a 20.8-percent reduction.
DHS detained over 4,600 pregnant women in calendar years 2016 through 2018. GAO was asked to review the care of pregnant women detained in DHS custody. This report addresses (1) what available data indicate about pregnant women held in DHS facilities; (2) what policies and standards DHS has to address pregnant women's care, and to what extent they are applicable across all facilities; and (3) what is known about the care provided to pregnant women at DHS facilities. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed ICE data and inspection findings from calendar years 2015 through 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review; reviewed complaints submitted to various entities from January 2015 through April 2019; and interviewed DHS officials and pregnant women who were detained at three of the four U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities GAO visited. From calendar year 2016 to 2018, ICE had over 3,600 detentions of pregnantWomen in its custody. These pregnant women were detained for a total of almost 50,300 days. Of these pregnant women, 58 experienced a miscarriage, two had an abortion, and one gave birth. Of those, 37 miscarriages and one birth involved women detained at IHSC-staffed facilities that were staffed by ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) staff, and some of these women were in our study population of over4,600 detained pregnant women (see figure). GAO also analyzed reports and data from five ICE inspections that address compliance with pregnancy-related policies and detention standards from 2015 through July 2019—the most recent information available. These inspections—along with available medical data and interviews with pregnant detainees—offer insight into the care that pregnant women receive in ICE facilities. For example, one inspection found that compliance was 91 percent or more for each of six performance measures on whether a pregnancy test was performed at intake from December 2016 through March 2019, and all 10 pregnant women GAO spoke with in ICE detention said that they received pregnancy tests when they arrived at the facility or within the same day or within 2 weeks of being detained. For the second inspection that included nine performance measures, compliance was 79 percent for most of the nine measures from fiscal years 2015 to 2018. In addition, all 10 of the pregnant women interviewed stated that they were not aware of any instances of the use of segregation or restraints on pregnant women during their time in detention, and the officials GAO interviewed at the four locations generally stated that pregnantWomen are not to be segregated except in extreme circumstances, such as risk of violence or escape—which is consistent with ICE policies. For medical care, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) generally relies on offsite facilities for care for pregnant women. CBP does not routinely administer pregnancy tests and generally did not have on-site medical personnel at its facilities. However, CBP has efforts underway to enhance its medical support at selected facilities. DHS has various processes to obtain and address the hundreds of medical care complaints it receives annually. From January 2015 to April 2019, detainees, family members, non-governmental organizations, or other parties submitted 107 unique complaints to various DHS entities—54 regarding ICE, 50 regarding CBP, and 3 regarding both ICE and CBP. Some of these complaints were under investigation as of August 2019 and some were substantiated; however, in most cases there was not enough information for the investigating agency to determine if proper care had been provided, among other things. Regarding the complaints against ICE, the more common type was that ICE allegedly did not provide medical care or that the medical care was not quality or timely. The most common complaint against CBP involved allegations of mistreatment or mistreatment of a pregnant woman. DHS policies and Detention Standards that Address the Care of Pregnant Women Vary by Facility Type and Component ICE has a range of pregnancy-care topics that vary across facility types; ICE is taking actions to address gaps in its policies. Specifically, in December 2019, ICE revised its 2000 ICE National Detention Standards and is in the process of updating its 2008 Performance-Based National Detention standards, which address many of the gaps that GAO identified for the pregnancy topics.
As sales of cigarettes generally decreased over the past 10 years, combined sales of roll-your-own tobacco, pipe tobacco, small cigars, and large cigars have increased as a percentage of the total market. However, cigarette sales continue to dominate the market for smoking tobacco products. In 2009, Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA), which increased federal excise tax rates on these products. CHIPRA also increased the tax rate for pipe tobacco but not to the level of the other three products. GAO was asked to examine the effects of these changes on federal revenue. This report examines (1) market shifts in smoking tobacco product sales and federal revenue effects, (2) the estimated effects on federal revenues if the market shifts had not occurred, and (3) what is known about the effects on revenue if Congress were to eliminate current tax disparities between smoking tobacco Products. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data on sales and excise tax payments for these products from October 2001 through September 2018, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review, and interviewed officials from the Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). GAO also interviewed representatives from other organizations working on tobacco and taxation issues to obtain background information on markets, industry, and consumption practices and trends for tobacco products, among other things. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Departments of Treasury, Homeland Security, and Labor generally concurred with the report's findings and provided technical comments, which GAO has addressed as appropriate. Large tax disparities among similar tobacco products created opportunities for tax avoidance and led to immediate market shifts to the lower-taxed products. After CHIPra took effect in 2009, sales of large cigars rose sharply, while sales of small cigars plunged. Large cigar sales increased from approximately 50 percent of the combined market in fiscal year 2008 to approximately 92 percent by fiscal year 2010 and reached approximately 97 percent by the end of fiscal year 2018. Small cigar sales dropped from 3.6 billion to 1.0 billion sticks between fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and declined further to 0.4 billion sticks by fiscal years 2018. Market shifts to avoid increased tobacco taxes following CHIP RA have continued to reduce federal revenue and GAO estimates that federal revenue losses due to these shifts range from approximately $2.5 to $3.9 billion from April 2009 to September 2018. In contrast, total tax revenue collected for smoking Tobacco products, including cigarettes, amounted to about $138 billion over the same time period. Federal revenue would likely increase if pipe tobacco tax rates were equalized to the rates currently in effect for roll- Your-own and cigarettes, while the revenue effect on small cigars is unknown because the data needed for conducting this analysis are not available. Under current tax rates, TTB and CBP would collect approximately $825 million from October 2018 through September 2023 if the federal excise taxes on pipe tobacco were increased to the higher rate of $24.78 per pound compared to the roll-Your-own tax rate, and $1.3 billion in additional federal revenue would be collected for these two products for the same period. Legislative proposals in the 115th and 116th Congress for changing the tax on large cigars include replacing the ad valorem tax rate with a rate based on weight, together with a minimum tax per cigar. Equalizing federal excise rates on small and large cigar taxes would likely raise revenue based on past experience, but the specific revenue effect is not known because data needed to conduct this analysis were not available for this analysis. In the absence of these data, it is not possible to reliably calculate the potential effect on tax revenue of a counterfactual scenario for equalizing federal cigar excise taxes.
DHS's CBP apprehended about 213,400 family units along the southwest border in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2019 alone—approximately a 33 percent increase over the entire previous fiscal year. GAO was asked to review family separations. This report examines (1) what CBP data indicate about the numbers and characteristics of family units who have been apprehended, (2) the extent to which CBP has developed and implemented policies and procedures for processing family units apprehended, and (3) how DHS shares information with HHS about unaccompanied alien children (UAC), including those who initially arrived with and were separated from their parents or other adults. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed CBP, Border Patrol, and Office of Field Operations (OFO) data on family unit apprehensions from fiscal year 2016 through the second quarter of fiscal Year 2019, and interviewed DHS and HHS officials. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data indicate that the number of CBP apprehensions of family unit members—individuals who entered the United States illegally and were determined to be inadmissible or potentially subject to removal—increased from about 120,400 apprehensions in fiscal years 2016 to about 160,400 in fiscal year 2018. In addition, CBP officials stated that family unit member apprehensions grew as a percentage of total southwest border apprehensions during fiscal years 2018 and 2019, from about 22 percent to about 51 percent. CBP also reported that it separated at least 2,700 children from their families from April 19, 2018, through March 31, 2019. Border Patrol and OFO data indicate the reasons for these separations varied. For example, about 50 percent of adults and children were separated due to the criminal history of the adult or a child safety concern, according to Border Patrol data. Border patrol officials stated they are unsure why the separation reasons available in the data systems do not fully align with CBP policy, but stated that Border Patrol officials review and approve each family separation to ensure it meets CBP's policy. However, it is sometimes not clear how separation reasons in Border Patrol's andOFO's data systems align with the potential separation reasons CBP established in its June 2018 policy. For instance, Border patrol's option for "family member prosecuted for other reasons" does not provide enough information to determine whether Border Patrol is referring a parent for the prosecution of a felony, as required by CBP policies. As of October 2019, officials with Border Patrol stated that they do not have any current plans to update their data systems to ensure that options for separation reasons clearly align withCBP policy. In June 2019, DHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) stated that it was aware of 46 cases in which a child was referred to ORR because CBP had assessed the family unit to be invalid. In at least 10 of those cases, the family was later determined to have valid family relationships and the child was later reunited with his or her separated parent, as of June 2019. In April 2018, DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established a memorandum of agreement regarding information sharing for UAC. In July 2018, HHS and DHS issued a Joint Concept of Operations to memorialize interagency policies, procedures, and guidelines related to the processing of UAC, but GAO found that DHS has not consistently provided ORR with information and documents as specified in the memorandum of understanding and the joint concept of operations, as GAO recommended in 2015. In particular, ORR officials identified additional information they believe they need from DHS at the time of referral (or soon thereafter) to inform their decisions about placing children with sponsors and reunifying separated families, when necessary. ORR also stated that DHS is not routinely sharing information about UAC with ORR, such as details about the circumstances of family separation, and this information is not covered by existing interagency agreements. Further, while Border Patrol has taken steps since GAO's 2015 report to improve its referral process, Border Security has not updated its referral screen to reflect ORR's data system, which has required ORR headquarters staff to manually enter some required information into the ORR data system. As a result, some of the information in the referral screen does not include input in specific information—for example, information about the reason for a family separation—as required by DHS policy. DHS and ORR have taken some steps to share information, but have not resolved long-
The federal government leases offshore oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and collects royalties associated with their production. BOEM is to ensure that the federal government receives fair market value for these resources. GAO was asked to review BOEM's process for awarding offshore leases. This report examines (1) the extent to which BOEM assesses potential changes to the fiscal terms of offshore leases in advance of lease sales, (2) how changes in oil prices and royalty rates affect the amount of industry bids for offshore leases, and (3) how BOEM evaluates its tract valuation process and whether it ensures receipt of fair market values for these leases. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed BOEM lease sale data from March 2000 through June 2018, reviewed BOEM documents, and interviewed BOEM officials and industry representatives. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) regularly assesses the potential for changes to fiscal terms in annual and supplementary lease sale-specific analyses, but has made little demonstrable progress toward developing a progressive, priced-based offshore royalty system. Specifically, BOEM conducts an annual analysis of various factors affecting the offshore fiscal system that informs its development of fiscal term options for all lease sales to be held in the subsequent year. These factors include resource potential, market conditions, industry news, market prices, and international considerations. For example, in its annual analysis for its August 2017 and March 2018 lease sale, BOem analyzed the potential effect of five royalty rate changes from the 18.75 percent rate that had been in place since 2008. Two of the potential changes were targeted to specific types of production or water depths and three would apply to all production. For the targeted changes BOEM considered a lower natural gas royalty and a lower shallow water royalty—both at the statutory minimum of 12.5 percent. The other potential changes included lowering royalty rates on all production to 12. 5 percent, 15 percent, and 16.67 percent. For each of these scenarios BOEM modeled effects on overall production and revenue at various market prices. Based on GAO's analysis of BOEM data, the bureau's tract valuations were generally low relative to industry bids, largely due to the cumulative effect of three aspects of its bid valuation process. First, the Bureau conservatively forecasts the key parameters used in its valuation model, which systemically lowers its valuations. Second, it forecasts unreasonably high levels of depreciation, which further lowers acceptable bid thresholds. Third, it selectively further lowers many valuations from its model to justify accepting bids it otherwise would reject. In addition, it conducts limited self-evaluations of its process and does not have a systematic mechanism to address deficiencies, such as those described above. According to federal standards for internal control, agency management should define objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks and define risk tolerances. Developing a documented plan for assessing whether and how to implement a progressive royalty structure that defines these aspects would help position BOEM to better understand the potential benefits such a structure could offer in terms of improving fair return to the taxpayer while fostering diligent offshore energy development.
In fiscal year 2018, CBP apprehended more than 700,000 noncitizens, including families, at or between U.S. ports of entry. Family members apprehended together may encounter multiple federal agencies and components during their immigration proceedings, including the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). GAO was asked to review family relationships at the border. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS has identified, collected, documented, and shared information about apprehended family members and (2) the information available to other DHS components to support decisions on individuals' administrative immigration or other proceedings. GAO analyzed agency documentation and interviewed agency officials. DHS has not identified the information it needs about family members who were apprehended together and has not communicated that information to relevant components across the department. CBP, USCIS, and ICE collect information on family members to meet their own operational needs, such as identifying eligible dependents for credible fear screening. However, these components do not have a mechanism to share this information with other components that might encounter those family members. For example, USCis does not have the information needed to identify dependents who may be eligible for relief from removal based on their family relationships and ICE does not know if family members detained together are eligible to be removed from the United States. Without identifying and communicating department-wide information needs with respect to family members that have been apprehended together, DHS lacks reasonable assurance that its components are identifying all individuals who may have been eligible to receive relief based on family relationships or that ICE can provide ORR with the information necessary to evaluate the suitability of potential sponsors for unaccompanied alien children (UAC). CBP's Border Patrol and OFO document the circumstances under which family members are apprehended and, as a result, are in the best position to collect and document information about family relationships, but GAO's analysis of DHS documentation and interviews with agency officials indicate that CBP does not routinely collect all of the information that is needed. For instance, Border Patrol agents and officers do not routinely document that information on the record of apprehension, which is a key form in the paper A-file that is the official record of an apprehension. Without such information, DHS components may not be able to identify family members apprehended in the same place at the same time and thus may not have sufficient information to assist ORR in making suitable sponsorship determinations for UAC. Collecting and documenting information about the relationships between families apprehended together could help address fragmentation among DHS components and improve the information made available to ORR to ensure that relevant information is available to support individuals' decisions on administrative immigration proceedings. DHS components' data systems were developed to meet each component's needs, leading to data system integration limitations and variation in the type of information that each component collects or requires. Components have implemented ways to share some information across their data systems, but such information sharing is limited, and components have not developed a shared unique family member identifier that would allow each component access to certain family member information. Evaluating options for developing a shared family member identifiers would help bridge the information gaps between components caused by DHS's fragmented data systems.
Millennials have a number of unique characteristics that distinguish them from previous generations, including higher levels of educational attainment and lower levels of student debt than previous generations. GAO was asked to examine Millennials' financial circumstances. This report examines (1) what is known about intergenerational income mobility, and (2) how the financial circumstances of Millennials compare to previous generations in terms of assets, debt, and net worth. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant economic studies, analyzed data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to provide a snapshot of Millennial households in 2016, and interviewed experts on economic mobility and financial conditions. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Departments of Labor and the Treasury and the Social Security Administration provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. In 2016, Millennials had similar average incomes and lower average net worth as previous generations at similar ages, according to GAO's analysis of SCF data. These findings suggest that, on average, real income levels have been stagnant for young adult households across these three generations. While college graduates generally have higher incomes than non-college graduates, the income of degree holders has remained flat over time. In addition, Millennials have lower net worth, which is assets minus debt. For example, Millennials in 2016 had lower average and median net worth than Generation X households in 2001 and Baby Boomer households in 1989, but were as likely to have retirement resources (defined benefit pensions or retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s or IRAs) and have a similar average value of retirement accounts as Generation X. In terms of debt, Millennials hold large amounts of student loan debt, but are also more likely to be college educated. While the average student loan-to-income ratio has increased over time for households of all incomes, it has most greatly affected lower-income households. While Millennials are saving for retirement, the accumulation of wealth through homeownership has decreased as fewer Millennials are buying homes. However, Millennials' homeownership rates are lower than those of previous generations and they have less home equity than past generations. Given relatively stagnant average income across generations, it is not clear whether Millennials will begin earning more and buying homes later in life or whether lower homeship rates will persist over time, as has been the case in the past. The economic mobility of Millennials is linked to parental income, race, and geography, and varies by race and geography. The 20 studies that we reviewed indicate that economic mobility has remainedflat or declined in the United States over the last 40 years; none of the studies we reviewed found economic mobility to be increasing. Studies identified parental income and race as key determinants of one's economic mobility, particularly for the lowest and highest income groups. The research we reviewed indicates that the region, state, commuting zone, county, and most especially, the neighborhood in which one grows up affects economic mobility in adulthood, but these effects vary by demographic and income group. For instance, one study found that a child's neighborhood has a statistically significant effect on life chances, and that growing up in a low-income, metropolitan neighborhood can have a strong negative effect on future earnings. Conversely, a child who grows up in an affluent neighborhood has almost as large an impact on future earning as completing a bachelor's degree.
In fiscal year 2018, VHA's health care systems provided care to 518,570 veterans with a diagnosed SUD, a 9.5 percent increase from fiscal year 2016, according to VHA data. The majority of these veterans had an alcohol use disorder. VHA also provides care to veterans with opioid use disorder, a subset of SUDs, in both urban and rural areas. GAO was asked to review issues related to veterans' access to SUD services. This report examines, among other things, (1) the number of veterans receiving and expenditures for VHA specialty SUD care and (2) any differences between veterans' use of these services in rural and urban areas and the issues affecting access to those services. To do this work, GAO analyzed VHA SUD data from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, reviewed agency documents and literature, and interviewed VHA officials in six VHA health care system locations selected based on geographic location and other factors. The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provided specialty substance use disorder (SUD) services to 152,482 veterans in fiscal year (FY) 2018. This number has increased slightly but remained relatively unchanged since FY 2014. During the same time period, expenditures for these services increased from $552 million to $601 million, and expenditures per capita increased from about $3,691 to $3.941, adjusted for inflation. In FY 2018, veterans' average length of stay generally decreased from nearly 40 days to nearly 36 days, while wait times varied across programs. The median wait times to enter residential rehabilitation treatment programs dedicated to S UD treatment varied considerably, ranging from 0 days to 56 days across the programs in FY 2018. However, not all programs had sufficient wait-time data to provide reliable data on wait times, and some did not consistently code whether a patient's visit included a screening for admission to the program. In fiscal year 2019, officials implemented changes to address the lack of reliable data from some facilities, but it is too early to tell if the new changes will address the data reliability issues in residential rehabilitation programs. VA also offers veterans medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders, such as methadone and buprenorphine, in a variety of settings, including outpatient specialty settings and residential rehabilitation. The number and proportion of veterans who received this treatment has risen in recent years, with 23,798 (33.6 percent) receiving it in FY2018, up from 19,944 in FY 2014, and 9,132 (38 percent) in FY 2017. In addition, in FY 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported that SAMHSA provided medication- assisted treatment to more than 1.5 million veterans with an opioid use Disorder diagnosis in outpatient settings. In rural areas, VA is taking steps to address several issues that affect the delivery of health care services generally, and SUD service in particular, including a shortage of qualified providers in rural areas and difficulties in recruiting and retaining providers to deliver care to rural veterans. For example, officials from two of the three VHA systems GAO selected for review expressed difficulty hiring and retaining SUD providers to provide care. In response to these issues, VA has implemented new initiatives and practices to increase the supply of rural health professionals, including those who provide Sud services. In June 2019, VA published a plan organized in three areas: increasing personnel, using technology to connect veterans to care through public and private partnerships, and expanding its infrastructure through the building or acquiring of space to address underserved facilities.
Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is responsible for the maintenance of surface ships based overseas, including ships based in Japan, Spain, Bahrain, and the United States. GAO was asked to review the Navy's overseas ship maintenance. This report (1) describes existing maintenance capacity and approaches the Navy uses for ships based abroad, (2) assesses the extent to which the Navy completed maintenance periods as scheduled in fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and analyzes factors contributing to any delays, and (3) evaluates the extent that the Navy has assessed challenges facing future overseas maintenance efforts. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Navy documents and data, interviewed Navy officials, and conducted site visits to three overseas homeports—Yokosuka, Japan, Sasebo, Japan; Rota, Spain; and Manama, Bahrain. The Navy maintains 38 surface ships at homeports overseas, but its approach and capacity for depot-level maintenance varies by location. For example, in fiscal year 2018, the U.S. Naval Ship Repair Facility and Japan Regional Maintenance Center (SRF-JRMC) in Yokosuka directly conducted about two-thirds of the total ship maintenance workload, with about one-third conducted by local contractors, according to Navy workload reporting documentation. Navy officials in Japan stated that current contractor capacity may not meet expected future workload. Additionally, maintenance planned for fiscal year 2020 is expected to increase beyond existing Navy and contractor capacity. Navy maintenance officials in Spain said that successful implementation of the new maintenance approach there relied on sufficient contractor capacity overseas, and Navy involved the contractor in the development of the maintenance approach to ensure they could implement it. However, the Navy did not complete the majority of maintenance periods performed on ships based on time during fiscal years2014 through 2018, and its analysis on the causes of the delays is limited. Specifically, Navy officials did not estimate the time needed to complete maintenance for about 70 percent of the 71 maintenance periods—about 50 of 71—that started during this time period, and more than half of the 50 maintenance periods that were completed late—29 of 50—went 31 or more days beyond the Navy’s planned schedule. As a result of maintenance schedules not being completed on time, all four overseas Navy homeports with surface ships GAO analyzed experienced a total of 3,475 days ships were in maintenance beyond their expected durations—referred to in this report as days of maintenance delay—during this 5-year time period. The Department of Defense (DOD) has begun planning to grow the fleet, but the expected increase in the fleet and associated maintenance requirements for ships homeported or visiting overseas were not included in the recent long-range plans. Also, Navy plans to implement updated maintenance strategies overseas, as well as grow the total fleet, were developed without accounting for risks that challenges may pose to these strategies, or analysis of the necessary overseas maintenance requirements to sustain the Navys strategically important ships. The 2018 National Defense Strategy has prioritized military readiness, which depends in part on ships maintenance on time to ensure that the UnitedStates is positioned to respond to all events quickly all over the world. Ensuring that Navy maintenance plans and capacity align with its plans for substantial future fleet growth will enhance its ability to conduct timely maintenance of its overseas surface fleet, which, in turn, is essential to achieving its strategic goals.
Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans can help borrowers with limited incomes afford their monthly student loan payments, but can also result in high costs to the federal government and taxpayers. IDR plans can ease repayment burden by setting monthly loan payments based on a borrower's income and family size and extending the repayment period up to 20 or 25 years, depending on the plan. GAO was asked to review issues related to IDR. This report examines (1) whether there are indicators of potential fraud or error in IDR information provided by borrowers and (2) the extent to which the Department of Education (Education) verifies this information. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed IDR data from Education's Enterprise Data Warehouse and Analytics database and interviewed officials from Education and four loan servicers selected because they serviced 96 percent of the outstanding balance of IDR loans as of September 2017. The results of these analyses are not generalizable to all IDR borrowers, but provide insights into potential fraud and error in borrower-reported information. Over 95,000 approved borrowers reported no income on their IDR applications, but GAO's analysis found that 11 percent of these borrowers may have had enough income to warrant a monthly payment of less than $5,000 on their associated student loan plan. These plans were held by about 76,200 unique borrowers who owed nearly $4 billion in outstanding Direct Loans. Borrowers may have a financial incentive to commit fraud to reduce their monthly payment amount and, by extension, possibly increase the amount of loan debt forgiven at the end of their repayment periods. For example, a borrower may falsely report zero income on an IDR application to reduce his or her monthly payment to zero dollars, which counts as a qualifying payment towards eventual loan forgiveness. In addition, borrowers may report family size that is larger than the number of people in their family, but this information is generally not verified by Education. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) National Directory of New Hires, a national repository of information reported by employers, states, and federal agencies, is the primary source of income information for borrowers who reported zero income. The National Directory includes information on newly hired employees, existing employees, and all individuals who apply for or receive unemployment compensation, as maintained and reported by state workforce agencies. For its analysis of borrower- reported incomes, we matched approximately 656,600 Education borrowers to NDNH quarterly wage data to determine if any borrowers had wages reported in the same quarter in which theirIDR plans were approved. We took additional steps to further review and refine these matches and provide reasonable assurance that the NDNH wage data were associated with the correct borrower by comparing state of residence to the state agency submitting the wage data and borrower name to the employee name reported in NDNH. For the refined matches, we then estimated whether the borrowers had sufficient annual wages based on NDNH wages to potentially warrant monthly IDR payments greater than zero dollars. We did not independently verify the wages reported for each borrower or the actual total annual income earned by borrowers identified in our match, as this was outside the scope of our review. Education does not have procedures to verify borrower reports of zero income nor, for the most part, to verify reports of family size, although there are approaches it could use to do so. Education has not fully leveraged available approaches, such as using data analytic practices and follow-up procedures, to help detect and prevent potential IDR fraud or errors. Federal internal control standards call for agency management officials to identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving program objectives, including the risk of using potentially fraudulent or erroneous information about borrowers to calculate monthly payment amounts for student loans. Data analytic practices that can help identify such risks include anomaly detection to identify atypical or unusual information and data matching with outside data sources to verify information that borrowers provide. These practices, which can be used on their own or together, can help prevent fraud from occurring and detect potential fraud.
Since 2013, the United States has provided nearly $1.5 billion in security assistance to Lebanon to strengthen its state institutions to allow them to exert sovereign authority and enhance security. Since at least 2015, the primary objectives supporting this goal have focused on 1) building the capacity of Lebanese security forces to exert sovereignty authority over Lebanese territory, including at the border and by maintaining internal security; and 2) enhancing their capacity to respond to terrorist and criminal threats. The U.S. also seeks to delegitimize and marginalize Hizballah by helping to support legitimate state institutions. GAO was asked to review the security assistance provided to Lebanon. This report (1) examines to what extent State and DOD assessed the progress of their efforts to meet strategic objectives related to security for Lebanon; (2) describes what safeguards they have put in place to limit the risk of security assistance benefitting terrorist organizations; and (3) analyzes the extent they conducted end-use monitoring (EUM) checks of equipment provided to Lebanese forces. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and Beirut, Lebanon, and reviewed a random, nongeneralizable sample of 16 items at two Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) sites in Beirut. The Department of State (State) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have reported both progress and challenges in meeting security objectives in Lebanon, but performance information gaps limit their ability to monitor the ongoing progress of specific activities and make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and attention. From 2013 to 2018, the Lebanese Armed Forces' (LAF) border security and counterterrorism capabilities have demonstrated some notable improvements. For example, a 2013 DOD assessment noted that the Lebanese government lacked effective control over its sovereign territory and indicated the LAF leadership was reluctant to engage aggressively in counterterrorism operations. By 2018, however, U. S. agencies reported that, following the expansion of LAF Land Border Regiments, Lebanon had established control of a large part of its borders for the first time in its history. In addition, LAF operations have enhanced its capacity in counterterrorism and counter-narcoterrorism, resulting in more operations. In 2017, for example, the Laf undertook a successful operation to expel ISIS elements along the border with Syria, making Lebanon, DOD officials noted, the only country in the region to successfully expel ISIS from its territory without the involvement of U.N. ground forces. The Lebanese Security Forces and the ISF have improved their capabilities since 2013, according to State and Department of Homeland Security assessments, reports, and interviews with officials. For instance, in 2017, State reported that its Antiterrorism Assistance program's assessment of the Lebanese Security Force found that the force improved its overall investigative capacity since 2013. However, despite reported progress, some challenges remain, including an ongoing need for new equipment and challenges with operating and maintaining some equipment, such as the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and A-29 light attack aircraft. State's Foreign Affairs Manual and internal guidance outline a number of good practices for ICS management, including assessing progress against strategic objectives at least annually and establishing performance indicators with targets to show the expected change over the course of each period of performance. State documents indicate that sound program design and performance management serve as the basis for efficient and effective use of department resources to achieve strategic objectives. If Embassy Beirut does not address the gaps in its performance information, it will be limited in its ability to ensure the intended alignment of policy, planning, resources, and programs through its annual reviews of the ICS. To reduce the risk that security assistance for Lebanon will benefit terrorist organizations, State's and DOD's two primary safeguards are to review Lebanese security organizations for ties to terrorist organizations and to vet individual recipients of assistance. For the first safeguard, State examines LAF and ISF for associations with foreign terrorist organizations (FTO) prior to providing support. Annual State, Foreign Operations, and Related Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2013 through 2018 included provisions to restrict funding for the ISS or LAF if they are controlled by a FTO. According to State officials, under these provisions, State regularly evaluates these institutions to determine if they have strong individual or organizational connections or alignment of purpose with a foreign terrorist organization. State officials said they have determined that both theLAF and theISF are independent institutions that HizBallah does not control. State also vet members of the security forces
SEC is responsible for regulating securities markets and enforcing securities laws, among other responsibilities. SEC has designated four offices and five divisions as mission-critical (i.e., primarily responsible for implementing SEC's mission). GAO was asked to review SEC's personnel management and organizational culture. This report examines (1) employees' views on SEC's management and culture, (2) SEC's efforts to implement a performance management system, (3) its implementation of a workforce planning process, and (4) its steps to strengthen communication and collaboration within and across its divisions and offices. GAO analyzed SEC data on its personnel management practices and workforce planning, conducted two surveys of SEC employees, and interviewed SEC officials. The results of GAO's 2019 survey of mission- critical SEC employees indicate that most employees had positive views on some aspects of SEC's organizational culture, such as the skills of their direct supervisors and colleagues. However, the survey results also indicate that employees had concerns related to performance management, a risk-averse culture, and perceptions of favoritism in hiring and promotions. For example, GAO estimates that 25 percent of employees agreed that hiring is sometimes based more on personal connections than on substantive experience and qualifications, and 35 percent disagreed that favoritism is not an issue in promotions. Employees had mixed views in other areas such as morale, communication, and training. SEC senior officers also generally had favorable views of their division or office's management practices. In contrast, senior officers expressed concern about SEC's performance management systems. Since 2013, SEC has twice redesigned its performance management System without periodically validating it, as GAO recommended in 2013. In 2016, SEC began to pilot a new performance system with a four-tier rating scale for non-bargaining-unit employees, but it did not validate this system. In 2017, SEC implemented a new two-tier system for bargaining unit employees. In 2018, SEC and the union agreed that SEC will implement another new system, including a new incentive bonus program, in 2020. According to SEC officials, SEC plans to work with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to validate the new system by surveying staff at the conclusion of the 2020 appraisal period, after which OPM will submit a final assessment of the program with any recommended actions for SEC. These plans are consistent with a 2013 GAO recommendation that SEC should conduct periodic validations of its performance system. Until SEC completes its planned activities, however, this recommendation remains unaddressed. In addition, SEC's new performance incentive bonuses program will provide opportunities for high-performing employees to earn a bonus of up to $10,000 once per fiscal year. GAE's prior work on strategies federal agencies can use to manage performance-oriented pay systems has shown the need for agencies to build in safeguards to enhance transparency and ensure the fairness of pay decisions. One such safeguard is to include multiple levels of review of performance ratings and pay decisions to ensure consistency and fairness in the process and the resulting decisions. SEC officials told GAO that specific policies and procedures for the bonus program were still being developed at the time of our review, but they could not provide details on how they planned to ensure transparency and fairness. Without adequate safeguards, employee dissatisfaction with performance management may persist and could undermine the credibility of the new bonus program. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken action to fully implement two recommendations GAO made in 2013 and 2016 related to developing and implementing a comprehensive workforce and succession planning process that is consistent with OPM guidance. In fiscal year 2019, SEC developed a new workforce planning strategy that outlined new processes for workforce planning. SEC's previous process focused on creating a consolidated workforce plan in a single document that focused on five divisions and two offices, accounting for 67 percent of the agency's employees. The new process is more dynamic and responsive because it provides more workforce data to officials in the division and office levels. SEC also developed various human capital dashboards that provide agency leaders with up-to-date data on the state of the workforce, including data on hiring, attrition, skill gaps, and other workforce demographics. SEC is still refining this new approach and plans to consider additional enhancements to the dashboards to inform discussions of future workforce needs. In response to two other GAO recommendations, SEC created cross-divisional committees and working groups that help to enhance intra-agency communications and collaboration.
In December 2017, Congress enacted the MGT Act, which established the TMF to help federal agencies improve, retire, or replace existing IT systems. As of August 2019, Congress had appropriated $125 million to the fund, of which $100 million was appropriated in fiscal year 2018 and $25 million is appropriated for fiscal year 2019. GAO was asked to review TMF administration. This report (1) determines the costs of TMF as compared to the savings realized by projects that have received awards; (2) assesses the extent to which cost savings estimates for awarded projects are reliable; and (3) determines whether agencies have used full and open competition for any acquisitions related to the awarded projects. To do so, GAO analyzed TMF project proposals and cost estimates and interviewed officials from OMB, GSA, and the five agencies that received TMF funding as of August 31, 2019. The Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) Program Management Office, within the General Services Administration (GSA), has obligated about $1.2 million to cover its operating expenses and has collected about $33,165 in administrative fees for the first 11 months of the fund's operation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) are responsible for overseeing TMF, while GSA is responsible for administering the fund. The TMF Program Management office's administrative fee collection has been limited due to a number of factors that have affected the amounts scheduled to be collected. For example, no fees were collected in the first year of operation because no projects were required to start paying administrative fees until fiscal year (FY) 2019, which deferred the start of the office's fee collection by one year. Further, the office did not expect that the agencies' selection of a 5-year repayment term instead of a 3-year term to repay awarded funds would significantly affect fee collection because the longer repayment term means that these funds are not as readily available to award to new projects and generate new fees. As a result of these factors, OMB and the office are not on track to recover all TMF operating expenses in a timely manner, thereby hindering GSA's ability to maximize the amount of appropriations available for award. In addition, officials responsible for the management of four of the seven TMF-funded projects reported that they were planning to make significant changes to their projects' projects' approved scope or scheduled milestones. Officials from the other two projects reported in August 2019 that they planned to present their changes to the board for approval. Based on GAO's analysis, these changes are expected to affect the four projects' administrative fee repayment schedules by $369,117 and reduce two projects' fees by $2.369 million by FY 2025, respectively. As GAO previously reported in May 2016, it will take at least 5 years (until 2024) for the office to recover the operating costs incurred in FY 2019 with the current collection of administrative fees, and it is likely that the office will take longer than 5 years to recover these operating costs. As such, it is not clear when it will be able to recover its operating costs in FY 2020 and beyond. The seven projects that were awarded TMF funds have not yet begun to realize cost savings, as required by OMB's funding guidelines, and GAO found that the projects' cost estimates were not reliable. Specifically, the projects did not incorporate all of the best practices for a reliable cost estimate as defined in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and OMB Circular A-11, which is referenced in this report. In particular, the cost estimates did not include a reliable estimate of project-related savings, and therefore, it was not certain whether the projects that GAO reviewed would save the government as much money as was estimated. As required, agencies are required to use a template to submit a project's cost estimate to the technology modernization board for review and approval. However, the template did not require agencies to follow any of GAO best practices, and there were no written instructions for the template regarding the data elements or the fields required to be completed. In the absence of detailed guidance from the office on how to complete the template, agencies were at risk of continuing to provide unreliable cost information in submitting their proposals.
NMB is responsible for providing for the independence of air and rail carriers and employees in matters of self-organization, helping prevent interruption to commerce conducted through the operation of those carriers, administering adjustment boards, as well as developing complementary strategies to resolve disputes. GAO has issued three prior reports on NMB and collectively had 13 recommendations. NMB had previously implemented six of those recommendations, and seven remained in GAO's current review. This report examines the extent to which NMB has (1) fully implemented one of the seven open GAO recommendations from prior reports, (2) taken steps to improve its agency management and oversight, (3) established effective internal controls to manage and oversee its annual appropriation and audit policy, and (4) implemented key information privacy and security practices, or met recent information security requirements. To conduct this review, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed NMB officials. The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) National Mediation Board (NMB) has fully implemented a recommendation from GAO’s 2018 report to create and monitor requests for outside employment, but has not taken action to fully implement the remaining six recommendations from past GAO reviews. By not fully implementing these recommendations, NMB remains at risk in several areas key to its mission, including information privacy, information security, and organizational climate, among others. For example, in its 2018 review GAO found that NMB did not establish a privacy program that included practices such as conducting privacy impact assessments and issuing system of records notices for systems that contain personally identifiable information. In addition, while NMB established the Office of Information Services and hired a new Chief Information Officer (CIO) to assist NMB in addressing information security and privacy recommendations, it has not updated its underlying information policies and procedures to reflect the current structure of NMB or performed a review of its system security plans. Until NMB complies with the recent Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) requirements, its data may be at greater risk in the event of a security incident. As an executive agency that uses a cloud service approved through FedRAMP, the NMB is subject to related requirements. However, the agency has not documented its authorization of the cloud service to demonstrate that it has accepted the risk of using the service. N MB has taken steps, such as reorganizing some agency mission areas and filling key staff positions; however, it lacks effective internal control to manage its annual appropriations and ensure that its audit policy is consistently followed. As a result, it did not use funding the Board said is needed to accomplish NMB goals. From fiscal years 2016 through 2019, over $4 million in unobligated appropriations remained in expired accounts in the U.S. Treasury and was unavailable to NMB for new obligations. In total, over 8 percent of its appropriations for the last 4 fiscal years went unreimbursed. In the last 3 fiscal years, the Board did not obligate its fiscal year appropriations because of uncertainty about the amount of final appropriations that would be available, and NMB lacked an effective process to reliably forecast the remaining amount of funding. While continuing resolutions can make it difficult for agencies to achieve hiring and other goals, until NMB develops a written plan to document its process for reviewing and monitoring the agency's annual appropriation to effectively manage its budgetary resources and spending, it will likely continue to miss opportunities to accomplish its goals. Similarly, until the Board establishes a specific process for the Board to monitor and evaluate NMB's adherence to audit protocols, N MB will not be well positioned to address audit recommendations from its financial auditors and GAO.
The federal government is on an unsustainable fiscal path. By the end of fiscal year 2019, the federal debt held by the public had climbed to 79 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). By comparison, such debt has averaged 46 percent of GDP annually since 1946. This testimony focuses on (1) the outlook for the federal government's long-term fiscal path and (2) actions that are needed to address this unsustainable path. The testimony is based on GAO's past and ongoing work on the federal budget and fiscal policy and on preliminary observations from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the 2019 Financial Report on the U.S. Government. GAO has reported numerous times that the full faith and credit of the United States must be preserved. The federal government cannot continue on its current unsustainable fiscal path unless Congress and the President take action to suspend or raise the debt limit, which is a legal limit on the total amount of federal debt that can be outstanding at one time. The debt limit does not restrict Congress's ability to pass spending and revenue legislation that affects the level of debt, nor does it otherwise constrain fiscal policy. The President's Budget, CBO, and the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System all make it clear that rising federal debt could have long- term consequences for the economy. For example, it could: constrain Congress’s ability to support the economy or address other national priorities, restrain private investment and thereby reduce productivity and overall growth, and erode confidence in the dollar. In addition, it may increase the risk of a fiscal crisis, in which investors would lose confidence and interest rates on Treasury securities would increase abruptly. If interest rates are higher, Treasury will have to refinance these securities at the higher interest rates, adding to the interest costs of the growing federal debt. Impending financial challenges for major programs and fiscal risks are both straining the federalbudget and contributing to the growing debt. To change the fiscal path, policymakers will need to consider policy changes to the entire range of federal activities, both revenue (including tax expenditures) and spending (entitlement programs, other mandatory spending, and discretionary spending). The longer action is delayed, the greater and more drastic the changes will be, placing an additional burden on future generations. While legislative changes to fiscal policies are needed, executive agencies can also take actions to contribute toward a sustainable fiscal future. These include reducing improper payments, addressing the $381 billion annual net tax gap, better managing fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, and improving information on fiscal operations to aid agency decision-making.
Section 653(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 mandates the President to report to Congress on how the U.S. government will allocate funds for foreign countries, by category of assistance, within 30 days of the enactment of the annual appropriations act. State and USAID are responsible for providing Congress with this report. GAO was asked to review the timeliness of State's Section 653 reports. This report examines (1) the extent to which State met the 30-day reporting time frame for fiscal years 2015 through 2018, and (2) the factors that affected State's ability to address these time frames. To do this work, GAO reviewed State's reports, interviewed State officials, and reviewed documents and interviewed officials from State, USAID, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In fiscal year 2018, the Department of State (State) did not meet the mandated time frame of 30 days to submit its Section 6 53(a report. State's process for submitting the report is not designed to meet this time frame. For example, State planned to complete the report in 85 days, but it took 189 days. State officials said that they have informally suggested to the congressional appropriations committees that the time frame should be extended, but they have not formally requested that Congress amend the mandate. State also has not conducted a systematic review of its process since it changed in fiscal year 2016, to identify areas that can be streamlined or eliminated to expedite the completion and submission of the report. Without such a review, State is not in a position to improve its process to meet the mandate to submit the report by 30 days. In addition, State officials noted that reaching agreement on priorities within the new administration and staff vacancies also adversely affected the report submission time frame in FY 2018. State did not have a plan to address the vacancies in its two offices that are primarily responsible for managing the Section653 process in 2018. Absent addressing these challenges, State will likely continue to be in violation of its legal mandate for submitting reports within the mandated 30 days after the appropriations act is enacted. State is also likely to continue to experience delays in submitting the reports due to data collection weaknesses that lead to data inaccuracies and hinders the efficiency of the process. State uses a spreadsheet-based data collection system to collect information on foreign assistance allocations from its offices, bureaus, and overseas posts. However, this system is prone to data entry errors that take extra time to correct, which contributes to the time required to develop the reports. Federal standards for internal control state that management should set objectives to meet requirements of applicable laws and regulations, and GAO's guidance on business process reengineering outlines best practices on how agencies should model their processes. While State is exploring options to improve the data collection process, it has not yet decided how to address weaknesses in its data system. State views its current process as necessary but has not reviewed it to identify potential inefficiencies.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) requires the Secretary of the Treasury to certify an event as an act of terrorism and provides for shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism. TRIA is scheduled to expire at the end of 2020. GAO was asked to review TRIA. This report examines (1) the current market for terrorism risk insurance and TRIA's role in the market; and (2) Treasury's certification and claims processes, and industry stakeholders' views on these processes, including guidance on cyber risk coverage. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Treasury reports, policies, regulations, and prior GAO work on this topic, and interviewed officials from Treasury, the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, insurers, and other industry stakeholders. The market for commercial property and casualty insurance for terrorism risks has been stable in recent years with the support of TRIA, according to reports from Treasury and an industry risk-management firm. According to these reports, the majority of commercial policyholders in the United States purchase terrorism risk coverage, and at a relatively small percentage of total premiums. The report by Marsh, an insurance risk management firm, attributed the competitive market for buyers to a steady decline in the frequency of global terrorist incidents and minimal insurance claims. However, insurers and policyholders are not aware of whether, and through what process, Treasury considers certifying an event under TRIA as a terrorism event. Without public communication about when it is considering certification, Treasury risks contributing to market uncertainty rather than stability after an attack. The purpose of Treasury's required consultation with DHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in certifying a terrorist event is to provide Treasury the necessary law enforcement, intelligence, and homeland security information within the two agencies' authorities and jurisdictions. Treasury has established and maintained informal connections with both agencies, but it has not documented these roles. By documenting agreements between Treasury and the two consulting agencies, Treasury can obtain quality information to help ensure a smooth and timely certification process. Treasury also has a process for fulfilling claims that uses a web-based system developed and operated by a contractor. The claims process begins for insurers when their total insured losses exceed 50 percent of their deductible within a calendar year, at which point insurers must submit a form notifying Treasury. Treasury's contractor has developed operating guidelines that detail work flows and controls for how it will begin processing claims. The operating guidelines include a plan to transfer existing staff from other responsibilities to operate the claims process, as needed. In December 2016, Treasury issued guidance clarifying that, to the extent that insurers write cyber insurance under an embedded or stand-alone policy in TRIA-eligible lines, the TRIA provisions apply. Industry stakeholders said that Treasury's guidance about cyber insurance coverage was clear. Some industry stakeholders said there was some initial confusion about the guidance because it indicated the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) created a new line for cyber liability on the property/casualty annual statement, although this was not the case. Treasury officials said there may have been some ambiguity in how they communicated the 2016 guidance. NAIC representatives said despite this initial confusion, the industry understood the guidance.
The federal government plans to invest more than $96 billion for IT in fiscal year 2018—the largest amount ever budgeted. However, GAO has previously reported that investments in federal IT too often result in failed projects that incurred cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. In response, Congress and the President have enacted various key pieces of reform legislation to address IT management issues. These include the federal IT acquisition reform legislation commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies, as well as the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act, which authorizes agencies to establish working capital funds for transitioning from legacy IT systems and addressing evolving threats to information security. GAO was asked to testify on its work related to federal IT. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which federal agencies have addressed the IT acquisitions and operations high-risk area, (2) the progress agencies have made in implementing key IT management and cybersecurity initiatives, and (3) efforts to modernize federal IT and strengthen the security of federal IT, among other things. To do so, GA O reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and prior GAO reports and interviewed officials from OMB and 24 selected federal agencies. In a February 2017 update to its High-Risk Information Technology (IT) Acquisition and Operations area report, which is based on GAO's prior work from fiscal year 2010 through November 2018, agencies still needed to complete significant work to improve their ability to effectively and efficiently invest in IT. Specifically, agencies need to continue to implement GAO recommendations to address shortcomings in IT acquisition and operations, including those aimed at implementing Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities, reviewing IT acquisitions, improving data center consolidation, and managing software licenses. As of December 2018, federal agencies had fully implemented 732 (or about 59 percent) of the 1,242 recommendations GAO made to OMB or federal agencies since 2010 to improve the management of IT acquisitions. Agencies need to ensure that IT acquisitions are reviewed and approved by CIOs. In January 2018 GAO reported that most of 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing and approving billions of dollars of IT contracts. For instance, most of the 22 agencies did not identify all of their IT contracts and did not fully satisfy OMB's requirement that the CIO review and approve IT acquisition plans or strategies. Further, only 11 of 96 randomly selected IT contracts at 10 agencies that GAO evaluated were CIO-reviewed and approved as required by OMB guidance. The 85 contracts not reviewed had a total possible value of approximately $23.8 billion. As a result, agencies may award IT contracts that are duplicative, wasteful, or poorly conceived. Until agencies ensure that CIO's review and approval of all IT acquisitions is complete, CIO will continue to have limited visibility and input into their agencies' planned IT expenditures and will not be able to effectively use the increased authority that FITARA's contract approval provision is intended to provide. In addition, agencies will likely miss an opportunity to strengthen their CIOS' authority and the oversight of acquisitions by not ensuring that they have a significant role in IT planning, programming, and budgeting decisions; and execution decisions and the management, governance, and oversight processes related to IT, as required in federal law and guidance. In the absence of comprehensive guidance, agencies have not been positioned to effectively acquire, maintain, and secure their IT systems. In its August 2018 report on the implementation of CIO responsibilities for six key areas of IT management, including leadership and accountability, budgeting, information security, investment management, workforce, and strategic planning, the 24 selected agencies had partially or minimally addressed the role of their Cios for two areas: IT budgeting and IT workforce. For example, most agencies' policies did not address the roles of theirCIOs for two of the six areas: investment management or strategic planning. In order to address challenges in implementing CIO roles and responsibilities in these six areas, in August 2018, in response to a GAO survey conducted for the report, the selected agencies also identified a number of factors that enabled and challenged their ability for effectively managing IT. Most agency CIO cited five factors as being enablers to effectively carry out their responsibilities, including guidance from NIST and OMB,
Marine debris—small pieces of plastic, metal, wood, and other materials that enter the marine environment from various sources, such as discarded fishing gear and abandoned and derelict vessels—is a growing problem. The Marine Debris, Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act, as amended (Marine Debris Act), requires GAO to review the federal government's efforts to address marine debris. This report examines (1) how the interagency committee coordinates among federal agencies and the process for determining membership and agency representation, (2) the extent to which the committee's biennial reports contain required elements, and (3) experts' suggestions on actions the federal federal government could take to most effectively address Marine debris. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other federal agencies, as well as 14 experts with expertise in marine debris-related issues selected based on factors such as their experience with different types of marine debris or association with various sectors (e.g., academia or industry). GAO also interviewed agency officials and reviewed documents from the committee and other agencies. The interagency committees of the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Interior, Justice, and State; EPA; the Marine Mammal Commission; and USAID coordinates primarily through quarterly meetings where federal agencies share information about their individual activities related to addressing marine debris, but NOAA has not established a process to determine committee membership or agency representation. In addition, GAO found that while the committee reports provide information on the activities of individual agencies, they do not contain certain required elements. For example, the reports do not include an analysis of the effectiveness of the implementation of recommendations and strategies of the committee or recommendations for priority funding needs, as required by the Marine De debris act. NOAA and EPA officials said that such an analysis is beyond the scope of the information-sharing focus of the inter agency committee. By developing and implementing such a process, the committee would be in a better position to determine the extent that its efforts are making a difference in addressing the complex facets of the marine debris problem. Experts GAO interviewed suggested a range of actions that the federal agency could take, including increasing or improving actions already being taken by some federal agencies or taking new actions. The experts stressed that there is not one solution to the growing, multi-dimensional problem of marinebris. Rather, they said that a multitude of actions will need to be taken to address the issue. Experts and agency officials indicated that there would be a number of factors to consider in evaluating the suggested actions, including competing priorities and limited resources. Additionally, some actions could result in impacts or costs to particular industries, underserved communities, or consumer groups and identifying ways to mitigate such impacts would be important.
In fiscal year 2018, about 25,600 beneficiaries (primary and dependents) received black lung benefits from the Department of Labor's (DOL) Coal Mine Workers' Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund). Black lung benefits include both cash assistance and medical benefits, which may include hospital and nursing care, rehabilitation services, and drug and equipment charges. DOL estimates that the average annual cost for medical treatment for black lung patients was approximately $9,667 per miner in 2018. The Trust Fund is primarily funded by coal tax revenue, which is collected from mine operators and then transferred to DOL, which uses it to pay black lung benefit payments and the costs of administering the program. In 2018, GAO reported that Trust Fund expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue and Trust Fund borrowing from Treasury's general fund will likely continue to increase through 2050 due, in part, to the coal tax rate decrease of about 55 percent that took effect in 2019 and declining coal production. In addition, the Trust Fund's outstanding debt could still exceed $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2050, according to GAO's simulation. GAO was asked to testify on its recent work on the trust fund. This testimony is based on GAO reports and testimonies issued from October 2009 through May 2018 on the Black Lung Benefits Program. It addresses (1) Trust Fund revenue and expenditures and (2) the extent to which DOL's oversight of coal mine operator insurance is adequate. To conduct this work GAO reviewed DOL documents and met with DOL officials and industry stakeholders, including representatives of 22 coal mine operators that are self-insured and actively mining coal. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) transferred approximately $185 million of estimated benefit liability from five coal mining operators that filed for bankruptcy between 2014 and 2016 to the Coal Mine Trust Fund. These operators were required by DOL to provide collateral in the form of an indemnity bond, deposit or trust, or letter of credit in an amount deemed necessary and sufficient to secure their liability. However, the collateral required from these operators was inadequate to cover their benefit liabilities. As a result of these bankruptcies, the amount of an operators' benefit liability that is not covered by collateral could also become the responsibility of the Trust fund. Preliminary GAO observations from its ongoing work indicate that DOL did not regularly monitor these operators to ensure that the collateral they required from them was adequate to protect the Trust Funds. For example, DOL has not reviewed these operators' most recent audited financial statements and claims information since the bankruptcies of Arch Coal and Peabody Energy, two of the 22 operators, since 2014.
DHS is the third largest U.S. government department, with more than 200,000 employees and an annual budget of more than $50 billion. In fiscal year 2017, DHS's EEO program is responsible for ensuring that its workforce is diverse, inclusive, and equal. GAO was asked to review DHS's management of its EEO programs. This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which DHS has taken steps to identify and address potential EEO barriers, (2) DHS's efforts to improve the representation of minorities and women in its workforce, and (3) the actions DHS and its components have taken to address the areas of noncompliance identified by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). This testimony is based on GAO's recently issued report, GAO-2019-10-854 . GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, reports, and other documents from DHS components, and interviewed DHS officials. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) generally uses the information sources recommended by EEOC guidance to help identify potential barriers, such as comparing its workforce data to relevant civilian labor workforce data and soliciting input from agency employee and advocacy groups, and union officials. DHS's Office of Civilian Labor and Employment Relations (CRCL) and its component EEO offices assist and support DHS components in identifying and addressing barriers. For example, CRCL meets with each component to obtain updates on their EEO efforts and provides verbal feedback as they develop their annual MD-715 reports. DHS components told GAO that they are generally satisfied with CRCL's collaboration practices. However, from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, EEOC found noncompliance in areas of EEO in DHS and components' reports to GAO. Specifically, DHS components did not have action plans to address nearly half (179 out of 369) of the deficiencies self-reported by all components from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016. For instance, in fiscal year 2018, DHS reported that it had not developed an action plan to ensure that all EEO directors report directly to their agency heads. EEOC requires agencies to develop action plans for each deficient measure. Developing policies and procedures to help ensure components' EEO Programs have action plan for addressing deficiencies could help DHS components better comply with EEOC requirements. DHS reported some improvements in employee engagement and representation of minority and women employees, but lacks performance metrics for tracking progress in eliminating barriers. In addition, DHS has reported challenges in collecting department-wide applicant flow data, which could aid in analyzing differences in selection rates among different groups for a particular job. DHS does not have complete performance metrics or mechanisms for tracking its progress towards eliminating its identified barriers. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should establish specific and measureable objectives, and ways to assess progress including performance metrics and milestones. Implementing performance metrics could also help DHS assess its progress. DHS concurred with this recommendation and stated that it would implement it by April 30, 2020. In February 2020, officials from CRCL told us they are working with DHS's Management Directorate to develop a potential overarching performance metric that, if approved, would be implemented beginning in fiscal years 2021. DHS and the components have identified various deficiencies in their EEC programs, but in some cases have not developed action plans that identify how they plan to address them. For each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2018, senior managers at DHS components reported that senior managers did not successfully implement EEO action plans and incorporate action plan objectives into agency strategic plans. DHS officials told us that components' action plans met EEOC's requirements for action plans by providing explanations for, or briefly stating plans to addresses, the majority of their deficiencies rather than developing action plans identifying how each deficiency would be addressed. Developed policies and policies to ensure components have plans for addressing EEO deficiencies would help ensure DHS components' programs meet EEOC-required action plans.
The Air Force's Space C2 program is intended to consolidate operational level command and control capabilities for Department of Defense (DOD) space assets into an integrated system, allowing operators and decision makers to have a single point of access to space assets around the globe in a timely manner. The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's efforts to develop these capabilities. This report (1) assesses the status of and plans for ongoing Air Force efforts and (2) identifies challenges the Air Force faces in developing these capabilities for space. To do this work, GAO analyzed Air Force documents and interviewed officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Space Defense Center, and other DOD offices. The Air Force expects to spend between $72 million and $108 million per year on its Space Command and Control (C2) program through fiscal year 2024. While it is still early in the planning and development stages, the program expects to deliver a consolidated space command and Control system over the next few years using a new system design. The program also plans to use a modernized, iterative software development process called Agile development to more quickly and responsively provide capability to users. According to Air Force officials, this development approach is relatively new to DOD programs. Therefore, the SpaceC2 program and DOD officials are working to determine the appropriate level of detail needed for the program's planning documents as well as the best way to provide oversight of a non-traditional development approach. The Space C3 program faces a number of management, technical, and workforce challenges. Some of these challenges may ultimately be overcome by time and experience, and the Air Air Force has efforts underway to mitigate others in the near-term. But it is too early to determine whether these efforts will be sufficient to achieve program success. For example, while the program is working from a draft acquisition strategy, it does not yet have an overall program architecture. These plans are important for providing direction for a program and facilitating effective oversight by establishing a business case for the effort. A business case establishes that a program is necessary and that it can be developed with the resources available, and typically includes: a requirements document, an acquisition strategy; sound cost estimates based on independent assessments; and a realistic assessment of risks, including those relating to technology and schedule. GAO's work on best practices for knowledge-based acquisitions has emphasized that the success of any effort to develop a new product hinges on having the right knowledge at the right time, and that a better opportunity exists to meet program goals when the knowledge is available early. However, given that DOD's draft template is still subject to change, including these elements in the finalized acquisition strategy would help position the program for success. DOD is also working to address workforce challenges, including a lack of staff with expertise in Agile software development methods, which are different from the traditional approaches used by DOD, and according to DOD officials, proficiency in these methods requires specific training. In May 2019, the DOD's Defense Innovation Board issued a congressionally mandated study on software acquisition and practices. The report stated that numerous past studies have recognized the deficiencies in software acquisitions and practices within DOD and emphasized the importance of digital talent.
The 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season was one of the most active seasons in U.S. history, causing widespread damage and destruction to significant populations in the continental United States and the territories. In particular, two hurricanes—Irma and Maria—struck in quick succession and devastated the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. GAO was asked to review the federal response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. This report examines (1) the extent to which ASPR's leadership of the federal public health and medical services response to the hurricanes was adequate, (2) the actions ASPR and support agencies took to evacuate critical care and dialysis patients and deploy medical staff and facilities, and (3) how ASPR evaluated its response activities and identified areas for improvement. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials from ASPR, the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other federal agencies involved in the response. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and its support agencies, such as DOD, undertook numerous actions to address the public health needs in the U. S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the continentalUnited States following Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Harvey in 2017. For example, ASPR led the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS)—an interagency partnership among HHS, DOD, VA, and FEMA that provides medical response, patient evacuation, patient care, and medical equipment and supplies during a public health emergency. Specifically, after Hurricane Irma damaged critical health care infrastructure and created a deteriorating situation in St. Croix that necessitated life-saving evacuations of critical care patients to Puerto Rico (see figure), ASPR worked with other agencies to evacuate patients through NDMS and deploy personnel and medical staff to the islands. For the first time during an ESF#8 response, HHS's ASPR implemented a “hub and spoke” strategy—a system to deliver medical care over affected areas' population centers—to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria made landfall, according to ASPR officials. The USNS Comfort—a hospital ship maintained by the Navy that served as a mobile, floating hospital—was used to provide care to patients in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. DOD officials stated that approximately 2,000 patients were provided care on the ship during its 45-day relief mission that began in early October 2017. DOD also deployed medical personnel through its Disaster Emergency Medical Personnel System—VA's main deployment program for clinical and non-clinical staff to an emergency or disaster—to assist ASPR with staffing the Federal Medical Stations. Our review identified several key deficiencies with ASPRs leadership of its response that could adversely affect future large-scale responses unless they are addressed. These deficiencies included a limited ASPR presence at the emergency operations centers in the US Virgin Islandsa physical location where responders, including federal and state/territory responders, as well as nongovernmental responders, can meet to coordinate information and resources to support incident management (on-scene operations) during a responseas well as delays in tracking evacuated patients, the final status of some evacuated patients not readily available, and a misalignment of support agencies capabilities to response needs. For instance, ASP R did not track patients evacuated from the USVI immediately after the hurricanes because of delays in getting HHS tracking personnel to the region. In addition, while ASPR has developed a federal patient movement framework that may help prevent future delays in patient tracking, the agency has not exercised the framework with its NDMS partners to ensure it is sufficient and reliable. Without a framework that has been exercised with the other agencies involved with the NDMS response, there could still be a delay in HHS knowing where patients are located and being able to inform family members. ASPR completed a draft after-action report in February 2018 after several months of collecting feedback from HHS staff on the strengths and areas of improvement in the agencyS 2017 ESF #8 response activities; however, the draft is missing the perspectives of key parties involved in its response, including support agencies and other stakeholders intimately involved in disaster preparedness. Federal standards for information and communication state that management needs access to relevant information from external parties to help achieve objectives and address related risks. Further, the Standard for Program Management states that program managers should actively engage
FAA manages U.S. oceanic airspace, which stretches over parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans, and includes areas with high levels of air traffic, such as between California and Hawaii. To manage air traffic in this airspace, FAA must have the ability to monitor an aircraft's position as it flies along its planned route. To do so, FAA uses radar and ground-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology, which provides surveillance information to air traffic control facilities. FAA also has the option of using enhanced ADS-C technology to provide additional surveillance capabilities in oceanic air traffic. GAO was asked to review FAA's approach to enhancing surveillance in oceaned airspace. This report examines (1) the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) approach to enhance surveillance capabilities and (2) selected aviation stakeholders' perspectives on this approach. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed FAA documents and interviewed FAA and other aviation stakeholders, including representatives from selected airlines, air navigation service providers, and unions representing pilots and air traffic controllers. FAA provided technical clarifications on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. FAA is implementing new minimum separation standards supported by enhanced surveillance technologies and will begin operational use of the standards in 2021 and 2022, respectively. In April 2019, FAA executives approved a schedule and funding for the implementation of these standards. FAA's ability to implement these standards depends on the success of planned upgrades to its Advanced Surveillance Enhanced Procedural Separation (ASEPS) program, which is tasked with evaluating and comparing the costs and benefits of enhanced surveillance and space-based ADS-B to support the adoption of reduced separation standards. The ASEPS program's initial business case analysis found that the costs of using the enhanced surveillance technology outweighed the benefits by 6 to 1, according to FAA officials. As a result, FAA deferred a decision on whether to invest in using the technology to enable reduced separation until the agency can further study how to implement the new standards. According to FAA, the agency plans to further study the benefits and costs of the technology over the next 5 or more years. Based on the results of this study, FAA officials told GAO they could start preparing for an investment decision in 2025 or later. Selected aviation stakeholders GAO interviewed and surveyed identified several benefits they would expect to see from FAA's implementation of new minimum oceanic separation standards, including improved access to fuel-efficient altitudes, redesigned organized track systems, and access to user-preferred routes. While most selected airlines (12 of 14) were satisfied or very satisfied with how FAA manages the safety of U. S. oceaning airspace, most noted the need to improve operational efficiency. Specifically, 10 of 14 selected airlines reported experiencing operational inefficiencies, including not being able to fly at fuel- efficient altitudes. Many of these airlines (9 of 10) view adopting new separation standards as a way to address these in efficiencies. Other aviation stakeholders such as the unions representing FAA air traffic controller and commercial airline pilots also see the need for enhancing surveillance and adopting new minimum separating standards to ensure that ocean air traffic remains efficient as international air traffic grows. However, several selected airlines expressed concern that FAA risks losing its position as a global leader if it does not move forward with enhanced surveillance. For example, representatives from one airline told us that if FAA does not adopt enhanced surveillance, aircraft transitioning into and out of ocean airspace could experience delays.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating federal, state, and local efforts to respond to and recover from natural and man-made disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. FEMA contracts with state and local governments to assist with disaster response and recovery efforts. GAO's prior work has shown that FEMA has faced challenges in planning for and coordinating with state, local, and federal partners on disaster contracting. For example, in December 2018, GAO found that FEMA's advance contract strategy and guidance did not clearly identify the objectives of advance contracts or whether and how they should be prioritized for use in relation to new post-disaster contracts. In addition, FEMA's ability to adequately plan for and manage its disaster contracts is further complicated by persistent acquisition workforce challenges, including attrition and staffing shortages. This statement summarizes the findings of GAO’s December 2018 report on FEMA’S disaster contracting efforts, which addressed (1) challenges FEMA experienced in planning, coordinating with stakeholders, and tracking the use of contracts, and (2) coordination and planning concerns between FEMA and other federal agencies. To conduct this work, GA O reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and prior GAO reports; interviewed relevant federal officials; and conducted fieldwork in Washington, D.C., at FEMA headquarters and in five states selected to represent a range of disaster areas, including California, Florida, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. The results of these fieldwork visits are not generalizable, but provided insights on the challenges GAO identified. In December 2018 GAO reported that FEMA experienced challenges in its acquisition and workforce planning efforts for disaster contracting, including ensuring that there is adequate time to complete acquisition planning activities and identifying the contracting workforce required to execute mission needs. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to perform acquisition planning for all acquisitions to ensure that the government meets its needs in the most effective, economical, and timely manner possible. However, FEMA had not established timeframes or released guidance for the pre-solicitation phase of the acquisition planning process, when program officials identify a need and develop key acquisition package documents. Not adhering to suggested timeframes can place a burden on contracting officers and increase the likelihood of not awarding a contract on schedule. This, in turn, may create a need for FEMA to non-competitively extend the existing contract—this extension may be considered a bridge contract. To decrease dependence on bridge contracts, FEMA established an acquisition planning tool in 2016 to help track and monitor the status of acquisition planning timeframes for certain high-value and mission-critical acquisitions, including advance contracts, regardless of dollar value. In its December 2018 review of FEMA's guidance on advance contracts for goods and services commonly needed during a disaster—like security, transportation, and office supplies—GAO found it did not specify how often or what types of advance contract information should be shared with states and localities, or instruct FEMA contracting officers to encourage states to establish their own advance contracts. As a result, while some FEMA regional officials regularly performed outreach with states to assist them with establishing advance contracts—like for transportation and security services—other FEMA officials did so less frequently. FEMA officials told GAO that coordinating more frequently with states allows them to avoid overlap between state and federal contracting efforts and helps FEMA officials know what resources the states have in place before a disaster occurs and how long states are capable of providing those resources following a disaster. FEMA agreed to update its guidance to provide specific direction for contracting officers on the use and establishment of advanced contracts and stated it would update guidance and continue efforts to establish resources for state andlocal governments on advance contract use. In January 2017, FEMA updated guidance to include requirements for coordination with state- and local-government partners on the uses of federal advance contracts in response to GAO finding in September 2015 that there were inconsistencies in how FEMA's regional offices performed outreach on advance contracting efforts. Yet GAO has reported on similar inconsistencies in outreach efforts in December 2017 and December 2018. FEMA has not updated its guidance since then, and GAO continues to believe that FEMA needs to take additional steps to address these issues.
Medicaid expenditures are financed jointly by the federal government and the states. The federal government matches each state's Medicaid expenditures for services according to a statutory formula called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, which provides for a match that is no lower than 50 percent of a state's expenditures and no higher than 83 percent. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the Medicaid third-party liability statute to require states to apply cost avoidance procedures to certain claims for certain services, such as prenatal care services, when it is apparent that a third party is or may be liable at the time the claim is filed. The act also required GAO to review the impact of these changes. This report examines (1) the extent to which selected states have implemented these changes, and (2) how selected states plan to assess the effects of the changes. GAO reviewed relevant federal and state laws and regulations; interviewed officials from nine selected states; reviewed CMS guidance; and interviewed CMS officials. Officials from four of the nine states GAO selected for review stated that their state Medicaid agency had implemented the mandated third- party liability changes for prenatal care, which required states to implement cost avoidance payment procedures for claims for these services beginning in February 2018. For pediatric preventive services and services provided to child support enforcement beneficiaries, which are due to take effect in October 2019, Medicaid officials from six of the selected states noted that they were in the very early stages of planning how they might implement the changes, or had not yet developed plans for doing so. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicaid program, has not monitored states' implementation of the third- Party Liability Act of 2017 changes and has not taken steps to determine whether states are meeting the new requirements. In particular, GAO learned that five states continued to apply pay-and-chase procedures to prenatal care claims, despite the federal requirement to use cost avoidance since February 2018, and one state had been using cost avoidance for most claims for pediatric preventive care since 1986. CMS officials stated that they expect states to comply with current law, and that they do not verify states' compliance unless the agency is made aware of non-compliance. As a result, CMS does not know whether states have applied the federally required third- parties liability procedures to all Medicaid claims as required by federal law. CMS's failure to monitor the implementation of these new requirements is inconsistent with the agency's responsibilities for oversight of the program, including ensuring that federal funds are appropriately spent and that states are complying with current federal statute. According to most of the stakeholders GAO interviewed, Medicaid providers—especially prenatal care and rural providers—could face increased administrative requirements or delays in payments for services as a result of the payment changes to the three service categories in the Bip bipartisan budget act of 2018. Several stakeholders agreed that the tasks associated with identifying sources of third party liability and attempting to collect from third parties would shift from state Medicaid agencies to providers, although opinions differed on the extent that this shift would affect providers. For example, several stakeholders said that providers may opt to reduce or eliminate the number of Medicaid beneficiaries they serve, because of actual or perceived increase in administrative requirements and payment delays. CMS issued guidance in the form of an informational bulletin to states on June 1, 2018, to facilitate states’ implementation of key provisions of the act. However, CMS’s June informational bulletin is missing some key information and contains information that is consistent with the federal law, including information on pregnancy-related claims, which may not be consistent with federal law because it was last revised in 2016 and does not reflect current statutory requirements. CMS has not assessed whether state Medicaid programs are meeting federal third-Party Liability requirements, under which states must change how they pay claims for some services. In the absence of CMS oversight, the agency cannot ensure that federal money is being spent properly and states are compliant with federal requirements.
The Department of Defense (DOD) relies extensively on Internet Protocol (IP) networks to carry out its mission to provide the military forces needed to deter war and ensure our nation's security. In 2005, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance to federal agencies specifying a series of IPv6 transition planning and implementation requirements and associated due dates for federal agencies to enable the use of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). In February 2019, DOD issued a memorandum with a list of required activities for transitioning to IPv6. GAO was asked to review DOD's progress in transitioning to IPv6. This report examines (1) the status of DOD's IPv6 planning efforts and (2) the potential benefits and challenges of transitioning to Internet Protocol version 6. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials responsible for leading DOD's transition efforts. DOD has not completed most of the required planning activities required by OMB for its transition to Internet protocol version 6 (ipv6) and had not completed 12 of the 18 required activities prior to March 2020. For example, DOD had not yet completed an inventory of existing IP-compliant devices and technologies, developed a cost estimate, or conducted a risk analysis. According to DOD officials leading the transition effort, the department plans to complete these activities by the end of May 2020, but GAO has not received any documentation confirming this deadline. In addition, DOD missed its original September 2019 deadline to enable IPv6 on all commercially hosted public facing unrestricted services. DOD officials stated that the department expects to be able to complete this task by July 2021. Without completing these tasks, DOD will not be in a position to develop realistic, detailed, and informed transition plans and time frames. Further, without completing these basic planning requirements, DOD significantly reduced the probability that it could have developed a realistic transition schedule. Addressing these requirements would supply DOD with sources of meaningful information that would enable the department to develop a realistic and detailed transition plan and time frame. DOD plans to deploy IPv6 while still supporting IPv4 for legacy applications, services, and clients. This will result in a dual protocol environment and increased complexity. With two protocols, DOD would have to ensure the proper functioning of two separate, but interrelated, networks instead of only one network. While IPv6 could offer enhanced security, its deployment could also lead to new challenges with respect to the types of threats facing an organization such as DOD. While general security concepts are the same for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, it may take time and effort for transitioning organizations to acquire the level of operational experience and practical deployment solutions that have been developed for IPv4 over the years.
The 2010 Census was the most expensive in U.S. history at about $12.3 billion, and was about 31 percent more costly than the $9.4 billion 2000 Census (in 2020 dollars). According to the Bureau, the total cost of the 2020 Census was estimated at $15.6 billion in October 2017, approximately a $3 billion increase over the 2015 estimate. The 2020 Census will be the first decennial census in which the public is encouraged to respond via the internet. GAO was asked to review the Bureau's progress in preparing for the census. This statement addresses the extent to which the Bureau has made progress in (1) implementing key cost-saving innovations and ensuring they function under operational conditions; (2) managing the development and testing of its information technology (IT) systems; (3) ensuring the cybersecurity of its systems and data; and (4) developing a quality cost estimate for the2020 Census and preventing further cost increases. This testimony is based on GAO's prior and ongoing work related to the cost, accuracy, schedule, and security of the Census Bureau's (Bureau) 2020 Census efforts. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed Bureau documents, interviewed Bureau officials, and conducted fieldwork in Washington, D.C., and New York, New York. The Census Bureau (the Bureau) has made some progress in revamping its approach to the census, but it faces considerable challenges and uncertainties in implementing key innovations and managing its IT systems. For example, the Bureau is re-engineering its field operations, using administrative records, verifying addresses in-office, and developing an internet self-response option. If they function as planned, these innovations could result in savings of over $5 billion when compared to its estimates of the cost for conducting the census with traditional methods. However, in June 2016 GAO reported that the initial life-cycle cost estimate developed in October 2015 was not reliable and did not adequately account for risk. The Bureau has since updated its estimate and now estimates a life- cycle cost of $15,6 billion, which would result in a smaller potential savings from the innovative design than the Bureau originally estimated. While the planned innovations could help control costs, they also introduce new risks, in part, because they include new procedures and technology that have not been used extensively in earlier decennial censuses, if at all. The challenges facing the Bureau in such areas as planning and testing; managing and overseeing IT programs, systems, and contractors supporting the enumeration; developing reliable cost estimates; prioritizing decisions; managing schedules; and other challenges, are symptomatic of deeper organizational issues. In addition, the risks are compounded by other factors that contribute to the challenge of conducting a successful census, such as the nation's increasingly diverse population and concerns over personal privacy. If not sufficiently addressed, these risks could adversely impact the cost and quality of the census enumeration. To help improve its implementation of IT for the 2020 census, in October 2018 the Bureau revised its systems development and Testing schedule. The new schedule includes 16 operational deliveries for 52 systems, which have milestone dates for, among other things, development, performance and scalability testing, and system deployment. According to Bureau officials in the Decennial Directorate, the schedule was revised due to schedule management challenges experienced, and lessons learned, while completing the 2018 End-to-End test, which included 44 of the 52 systems and was intended to test all key systems and operations in a census-like environment to ensure readiness for 2020 Census. In February 2017, the 2020 Decennial Census was identified by GAO as a high-risk area needing attention from Congress and the executive branch. The key elements needed to make progress in this area are top-level attention by the administration and agency leaders grounded in the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List, as well as any needed congressional action. Although important steps have been taken in at least some of these areas, far more work is needed. Specifically, the Secretary of Commerce has successfully demonstrated leadership commitment and the Bureau and the Department of Commerce have strengthened this area with executive-level oversight by holding regular meetings on the status of IT systems and other risk areas. Moreover, on January 2, 2019, a new Director of the Bureau took office, a position that had been vacant since June 2017. With regard to capacity, the bureau has improved the cost estimation process of the decennial when it established guidance including: roles and responsibilities for oversight
With a substantial part of the total Air Force capability residing in the Air Force Reserve Components (RC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) relies on mobilized ARC forces to support its operations. GAO was asked to review AFSOC's use of the ARC to support special operations activities. This report examines (1) the extent to which AFS OC's mobilization process supports the ARC's needs for timely and reliable information and (2) what is known about reserve component units available for mobilization and voluntary deployment rates. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant Air Force guidance and documents and interviewed officials from Air Force components that provide ARC capabilities, including the Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Federal Reserve (AFR). GAO also interviewed officials at four reserve components selected based on factors such as geographic location, force size, and number of active duty and reserve component personnel. The Department of Defense (DOD) has processes in place to mobilize reserve component forces for special operations requirements, but it faces challenges in implementing these processes. For example, officials from three of the four reserve units GAO spoke with stated that they routinely receive 90 or fewer days' notice of when they are expected to provide capabilities for a given requirement, even though they predominately support preplanned requirements that are known well in advance of their execution. According to these officials, this can create challenges for the unit providing the capabilities because it must either provide the capabilities using volunteers or receive approval from the Secretary of Defense to involuntarily mobilize personnel with limited notice. In addition, officials at one unit stated that the location of a previous requirement changed at least three times in the 60 days preceding its involuntary mobilization. Officials explained that changes to the location meant that the capabilities required by the unit also changed, because the unit provides intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities that need to be supported by specific communications equipment. Further, officials stated that changes regarding what capabilities are needed can create training challenges unique to the reserve component. Other Air Force entities that provide reserve capabilities to meet Air Force requirements through mobilization have established alternative approaches to initiating, planning, and coordinating their respective requirements for reserve component capabilities. However, the Army Reserve Components Command (ARC) does not have the organizational capacity to effectively initiate, coordinate, and execute the involuntary mobilization process, and thus has not developed a mechanism for tracking volunteer deployment rates to better manage force utilization and mission execution. The Air Force's force-generation model provides the ARC with a 24-month picture of the units it anticipates will be used to meet potential Air Force-wide deployments, but the ARC does not currently have a comparable model with information on which ARC units could be used in a given period of time to meet special operations needs. Without such information, the ARC may not be fully prepared to support requirements or be able to effectively conduct its mission once in theater. The National Guard and AFR have taken some initial steps to create a force- generation model and consolidate the various unit-level schedules of ARC forces supporting special operations, but GAO found that there are no plans to institutionalize this effort. Without a consolidated schedule of ARC units that are available for deployment, officials may continue to have concerns that they will not have access to high demand ARC capabilities to deploy under a mobilization. The ARC also lacks complete information on voluntary deployments, which is a key piece of the force's support of special operations operations. Specifically, information on reserve components' volunteer deployments is not available in a form that facilitates tracking in order to understand rates of volunteering or the contributions made by the ARC in supporting special operation activities, according to officials.
While U.S. airlines' business practices were largely deregulated following the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, a number of consumer protections are in place at the federal level. For example, DOT has the authority to stop airlines from engaging in unfair or deceptive practices, or unfair methods of competition, and promulgates consumer protection regulations under its statutory authorities. DOT has issued three final rules on Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections from 2009 through 2016. These rules have addressed long tarmac delays, increased compensation amounts for passengers who are involuntarily denied boarding, and required certain airlines to post information about their fees and on-time performance on their websites. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 included a provision for GAO to report on the results of this work. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which airlines' operational performance has improved from 2008 through 2017, the most recent data available at the time of GAO's review; (2) passenger complaints reported to the Department of Transportation (DOT) and airlines on disability and discrimination issues; and (3) actions taken by airlines and DOT in response to operational issues. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed DOT and airline data on passenger complaints, denied boardings, mishandled baggage, and late, cancelled, or diverted flights. GAO also interviewed DOT officials and representatives from six selected airlines selected for review based on size, complexity, and location, among other factors. In 2018, airlines' overall operational performance—as measured by DOT data—generally improved, but GAO found that passengers filed more complaints and may experience a range of inconveniences, such as delays, cancellations, and missed connections. While rates of involuntary denied boarding (i.e., when an airline involuntarily denies boarding to a passenger who otherwise would have boarded the flight) and mishandled luggage generally declined over the 10-year period GAO examined (see figure below), airlines' on- time performance stayed about the same, while the rate of passenger complaints generally increased from 2008 to 2017. The number of complaints filed with DOT and airlines about disability- and discrimination-related issues increased from 2010 to 2017, and is expected to continue to increase in 2018 and 2019. In 2019, the number of discrimination complaints rose from 572 to 944, while passenger complaints on disability issues rose from 780 to 1,018. DOT's complaint data do not capture complaints reported directly to airlines, and GAO has previously reported that DOT officials estimated that, across all complaint categories, for every passenger complaint they receive, airlines receive about 50. Airlines have generally declined to provide GAO with discrimination complaint data from selected airlines, citing the proprietary nature of this information. Airlines and DOT have taken some initial steps to address consumer protections in other consumer protection areas, including providing employees with training on non-discrimination issues and providing additional incentives for passengers to volunteer to be denied boarding. In addition, some airlines have voluntarily implemented quality assurance programs to improve and sustain their disability-training programs' performance. DOT also has issued regulations related to certain consumer protections, including those related to the accessibility of aircraft lavatories and service animals.
In 2017, 70,237 Americans died from an overdose involving synthetic opioids, heroin, cocaine, and other drugs. The number of annual overdose deaths has nearly doubled over the past decade. Combating the trafficking and availability of illicit drugs in the United States is a government-wide priority that requires a coordinated effort by federal departments and agencies with counterdrug responsibilities. GAO was asked to review the effectiveness of federal counterdrug efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which the five DHS Joint Task Forces (JTFs) in GAO's review have coordinated their counterdrug missions and activities, and (2) the measures the JTFs use to assess and report on their performance. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed DHS documents and interviewed officials from the five task forces and other relevant stakeholders. GA O reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed DOD and DHS officials. The five Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-South) and JIatF-West, two of the three DHS joint task forces, have coordinated with each other and other federal agencies to prevent duplication of counterdrug activities. These efforts include information sharing and joint operations, such as sharing intelligence information and conducting joint operations. For example, in 2018, the JIATFs coordinated on an operation to increase intelligence and targeting capabilities to disrupt illicit drug trafficking organizations operating within their joint operating area in the Caribbean. JTF-East personnel deployed to headquarters to facilitate coordination and information sharing. As a result of this joint operation, the law enforcement agencies involved seized over 3,700 pounds of cocaine and apprehended 69 migrants, one smuggler, and the smuggling vessel, according to DHS documentation. The JTF officials GAO interviewed stated that they are satisfied with the level of coordination that takes place with the other task forces. The Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Justice (DOJ) task forces that GAO examined generally coordinated effectively to help minimize duplication of their efforts to combat drug trafficking. The extent of coordination varied based on whether the task forces had shared purposes and had areas of responsibility with overlapping or shared geographical boundaries. In particular, those task forces with shared purposes tended to coordinate with one another more than with the others. The task forces also used a variety of mechanisms to coordinate their activities, including the use of working groups and liaison officers, which GAO has identified as best practices for coordination. The three DHS JointTFs have not developed outcome-based performance measures that would allow them to demonstrate the overall effectiveness of their activities. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 requires the Secretary of DHS to establish appropriate performance measures to evaluate each joint task force's effectiveness. The DHS JTF Coordination Cell and the three task forces developed a new set of performance measures for fiscal year 2018 that were intended to better reflect their coordination activities and contributions. However, these measures are focused on outputs—such as the number of operations conducted in combating transnational criminal organizations—and not outcomes—for example, the number or percentage of leads that resulted in seizures of drugs. For fiscal year 2019, DHS officials told GAO they plan to further revise their performance measures, as they believe their measures could continue to improve.
SBA's 8(a) program is designed to assist small, disadvantaged businesses in competing in the American economy through business development. One of the key areas of support is eligibility for competitive and sole-source federal contracts that are set aside for 8( a) businesses, which can be an important factor of the financial development for African-American (ANC) owned firms. ANC-owned firms must be for-profit and are unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, such as black-owned and Hispanic-owned businesses. In 2006, 2012, and 2016, GAO issued reports that identified weaknesses in SBA's oversight and monitoring of firms participating in the program. GAO was asked to testify on the findings from these reports. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which SBA has implemented recommendations GAO made in these reports to improve its oversight of ANC- owned firms, and (2) the weaknesses GAO has identified in its monitoring and oversight of these firms. To do this work, we reviewed SBA documentation and interviewed SBA officials. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has faced long-standing weaknesses in its oversight and Monitoring of Tribal Firms in the 8(A) Program, in particular in its Alaska District Office, which is responsible for the oversight of firms owned by African-Americans (ANC). GAO found that SBA had incomplete information and documentation on ANC-own firms' compliance with regulatory requirements, limitations in its ability to track and share key program data needed to enforce revenue rules of Tribal firms, including ANC- Owned Firms, and insufficient staffing to carry out necessary and critical monitoring tasks. For example, SBA was unable to provide GAO with information on the total number of firms serviced by the agency or on the primary revenue generators for Tribal firms—that is, the firms generating the majority of their revenue in the same line of business—as required by regulation. In addition, SBCA did not have adequate program guidance for clearly communicating to staff how to interpret new regulations, which GAO previously found in its 2012 and 2016 reports. SBA also lacked sufficient guidance and training on key program regulations and internal monitoring practices, which resulted in inconsistent supervisory review of transactions and related documentation, and increased SBA’s vulnerability to compliance and fraud risks. In response to GAO’S 2006, 2011, and 2012 reports, which contained a total of 21 recommendations to SBA to address these and other program weaknesses, the agency has fully implemented 15 of these recommendations. However, it has not implemented six recommendations, three of which are important to enhancing SBAs oversight of African-Owned Businesses (ANC-owned) firms. For instance, in 2006 GAO recommended SBA take steps to ensure that it tracks revenue data and other information on firms under one parent ANC and ensure that multiple subsidiaries under one ANC are not generating their revenue from the same primary business line. In 2012 GAO also recommended that, as SBA is developing a tracking system, it should ensure that the system tracks revenue and other data on ANC owned firms under the same parent ANC. In 2016, in response to a GAO recommendation to implement a new method for tracking revenue data for firms under a parent ANC, SSA issued new regulations that allow it to change an ANC owned firm's primary business lines of business under certain circumstances if the greatest portion of the firm's revenues have evolved from one line to another. In its 2016 report, which was based on a review of eight firms that participated in the ANC program from fiscal years 2011 through 2014 (see GAO report GAO-16-846R ), GAO concluded that the new regulations were a step in the right direction but would be difficult to implement effectively without the proper tracking and visibility of revenue data.
DOD is the largest contracting agency in the federal government in terms of contract dollars obligated and number of contracts awarded. The scope and scale of this activity makes DOD procurement inherently susceptible to fraud. GAO was asked to review issues related to contractor ownership in DOD's procurement process. This report examines (1) types of fraud and other risks that contractors with opaque ownership could pose to DOD in the procurement process and (2) whether DOD has taken steps to address risks posed by contractor ownership. To address these objectives, GAO examined 32 cases of fraud involving DOD contractors that were adjudicated or settled from calendar years 2012 through 2018 and conducted interviews with knowledgeable DOD officials and criminal investigators. Contractors can pose a range of financial and nonfinancial fraud and national security risks to the Department of Defense (DOD) by misrepresenting or concealing company ownership information to commit fraud against the government or to do harm to U.S. national security concerns. For example, in a 2014 federal court case, a contractor and another company with common ownership pled guilty to fraudulently obtaining over $200 million in contracts that they were not eligible to receive, including contracts set aside for small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans or economically and socially disadvantaged individuals. DOD has not systematically assessed the magnitude and prevalence of these risks and has not yet identified contractor ownership as a risk area for assessment in its development of a fraud risk management program in accordance with federal internal control standards and leading practices, but it has taken some steps that could address some risks. In 2014, DOD and other federal agencies revised the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to collect some contractor ownership information, including beneficial-ownership information, to help identify past-performance issues across corporations to aid with responsibility determinations before awarding new contracts. DOD officials said that they did not want to be too prescriptive in directing contracting officers on the use of this information and therefore have not developed policies or procedures or provided training on how to specifically use the ownership information collected. However, conducting a department-wide assessment of risks to DOD from contractor ownership would be a key first step for the department before developing such policies and procedures. In addition, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has taken a number of steps, such as providing its contracting officials with a “contractor responsibility matrix,” which outlines mandatory, recommended, and optional steps to take when making a responsibility determination for procurements both below and above the simplified acquisition threshold. Further, DLA's contracting officers are required to review the Defense Contractor Review List, an internal tool used by DLA that is designed to monitor fraud, waste, and abuse for commercial entities and military unique items. DLA officials told GAO that the list can be used to communicate information or risks about contractor ownership and that DLA has not historically considered contractor ownership structures in the responsibility determination process, nor has the agency been aware of the extent to which such structures could pose risks. DOD also has taken other steps to use contractor ownership to address other risks, including those related to national security. For instance, DOD has conducted threat assessments to identify risks related to supply chains for national security systems and critical components, and it has identified and considered ownership information as part of its supply-chain risk analysis for procurement of critical components. DOD is also taking steps to identify and address legal provisions against contracting with the enemy, including identifying and considering ownership information during the process of vetting vendors to ensure that money is not flowing to contractors owned by a person or entity that is actively opposing U. S. or coalition forces involved in a contingency operation in which service members are actively engaged in hostilities. Although DOD has begun to consider contractor ownership, it faces challenges in identifying and verifying contractor ownership that could affect the department's ability to effectively manage fraud risks in the acquisition process, including the lack of a centralized information source or registry on company ownership in the United States. As a result, DOD could face challenges in time-consuming efforts to verify contractor ownership if the contractor is actively seeking to misrepresent its ownership. In 2017, DOD began efforts to design, implement, and operate an internal control system that addresses fraud risks and to comply with requirements established by the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015.
The Navy's four public shipyards are critical for repairing and maintaining the Navy's nuclear-powered ships and submarines, and the Navy spends millions of dollars annually on facilities and equipment in order to sustain shipyard performance. GAO has previously reported that the shipyards' age, poor condition, and inefficient facility layout have contributed to long maintenance times, increased costs, and reduced readiness. The Navy developed the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan to address these issues. The House Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for GAO to review the plan. This report examines (1) the extent to which the plan identifies critical deficiencies at the four shipyards, (2) how the Navy plans to mitigate these deficiencies, and (3) the cost estimate the Navy developed to implement its plan. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed the plan, interviewed Navy officials, and reviewed relevant documentation, such as cost estimates, and interviewed shipyard and program office officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) has identified a number of infrastructure deficiencies at its four public naval shipyards--including deficiencies in dry docks, facilities, and capital equipment--that negatively affect their ability to support the Navys current and future force structure. For example, the plan states that eight dry docks require modernization and recapitalization projects to meet the Navy’s operational needs, including accommodating new classes of ships. If all of the projects are completed as planned, the Navy anticipates that it will be able to recover 67 of the 68 maintenance periods that it currently cannot support through fiscal year 2040. According to the Navy, without these planned dry dock investments the Navy would lack sufficient capacity for about a third of its planned maintenance periods and would have to defer maintenance for some ships. This could result in ships being unavailable for use until a dry dock is available, effectively reducing the size of the fleet available for operational missions. The plan outlines steps that generally address the critical dry dock deficiencies the Navy has identified, although it does not anticipate completing these steps until 2035. However, because the initiation and completion of many of these projects is years away, it is too soon to determine whether the plan will fully address the deficiencies identified. In addition, specific actions to address other infrastructure deficiencies are not addressed in the current plan, adding additional uncertainty. Navy officials explained that the optimized layout of shipyard facilities, which is still in early development, will drive the future efforts that address deficiencies associated with roads, utilities, sidewalks, and information-technology systems, which are not address in the plan and will likely be several years before they can incorporate specific actions into the plan to address them. To address equipment deficiencies, Navy officials have stated that they will attempt to address the equipment deficiencies over the 20-year time frame by taking advantage of different equipment purchasing strategies and gaining efficiencies from the facility optimization effort that will allow the Navy to recapitalize equipment more effectively than was possible with its previous strategies. The efficacy of these strategies cannot be assessed until the Navy completes its modeling and simulation phase in fiscal year 2020 and develops more detailed plans for recapitalizing its shipyard equipment. To develop its plan, the Army, Navy, and Navy worked together to identify deficiencies in three major categories—dry docks, facility, and equipment—and then developed a cost estimate to understand the resources it would need to mitigate those deficiencies. The initial estimated cost to implement this plan over 20 years includes $4 billion for improvements to the dry docks; $14 billion for facilities; and $3 billion for capital equipment. The cost estimate minimally met two characteristics of a reliable cost estimate, partially met one, and did not meet one, as shown in the table below. The estimate does not include all costs, including those for utilities, roads, and environmental remediation, which will likely add hundreds of millions to the cost of implementing the plan over the next 20 years. Without high-quality estimates, agencies are at risk of experiencing cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. In June 2018 the Navy created a management structure—a program management office—to oversee the shipyard optimization effort, but has not yet identified clear roles and responsibilities for shipyards.
The Fostering Connections Act of 2008 amended title IV-E of the Social Security Act to allow states to extend foster care to youth ages 18 to 21 in supervised settings in which the youth live independently. The act also requires GAO to report on youth in extended care. GAO was asked to review issues related to extended care for older youth. This report examines (1) the extent to which states are using federal funds to provide extended care, (2) the types of supervised independent living arrangements states are offering to youth in care, and (3) the steps states are taking to ensure youth are ready to live independently in extended foster care. To address these objectives, GAO surveyed states in the 26 states approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to offer federally funded extended care between August and October 2018 and interviewed state and local officials in five states selected based on geographic diversity and other factors. In response to a GAO survey, all 26 extended-care states reported offering a variety of supervisedindependent living arrangements as a placement option for youth in foster care, with most of the options falling largely in two broad categories—transitional living programs and private residences. Youth in such settings may not have onsite caregivers and often have increased responsibilities, such as paying bills, assuming leases, and working with a landlord. However, youth may receive foster care services to help them become successful adults. Overall, across 21 of the 26 extended care states for which GAO analyzed placement data, about 34 percent of youth were placed in such arrangements in state fiscal year 2017. Officials in all five selected states GAO spoke with said they offer a range of services, including housing, education, financial literacy, employment, and health services, to help youth transition out of care. For example, in Maryland, county officials said youth nearing age 21 are enrolled in a 3-week intensive training focused on employment and housing called “Keys to Success,” which offers experiential learning through cooking demonstrations, budgeting and financial literacy training, group trips to stores to look at furniture or interview-appropriate clothing, and housing fairs. In addition, officials in California, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Tennessee, and Washington state said they have programs that help youth develop independent living skills such as grocery shopping and budgeting, as well as financial literacy and employment skills. In these states, officials also said that youth may experience challenges using these skills. Most states reported that they use federal Title IV- E funds to support youth in independent living, but in several states, few youth were eligible for this funding. In fiscal year 2018, the most recent year for which data were available, GA O reviewed, GAo found that the majority of youth ages 21 and older in care in 14 of the 17 extended- care states were not eligible for title IVE reimbursement, meaning that the state was responsible for most or all of the cost of their care. In some states, eligibility rates for extended care youth were as low as 30 percent or lower. State officials in three of the five states said that ineligibility frequently stems from family income exceeding the income limit for titleIV-E funding, which is limited to youth removed from homes that would have qualified for cash assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program as of July 16, 1996. Officials said they reconsider a youth's eligibility once the youth turns 18, using the youth's income at that point in time. Officials from these two states told GAO they close the original foster care case when a young person turns 18 and then reopen the case when the young person re-enters extended care to allow for new eligibility determinations based on the youth’s income at the time of re-entry into the foster care system, rather than the income of the home from which he or she was removed upon initially entering foster care (see figure). Officials in the remaining three states said they do not use this approach.
In 2014, the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault issued a report that recommended colleges conduct campus climate surveys on sexual violence to collect information on the incidence and characteristics of sexual violence on college campuses as well as related student attitudes and behaviors. GAO was asked to review federal efforts to address campus sexual violence. This report examines (1) what key stakeholders view as the strengths and limitations of using climate surveys, (2) what approaches selected colleges have used to survey their students, and (3) what role federal agencies play in helping colleges develop and implement climate surveys. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed three commonly used climate survey instruments and interviewed a total of 25 stakeholders with relevant expertise, including representatives of four organizations involved in developing the surveys and five additional researchers; officials from 10 colleges; state officials; and federal officials from the Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services (HHS). GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed officials from four states that require or recommend that colleges conduct such surveys. The Department of Education and the Department of Justice reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Stakeholders GAO interviewed, including survey developers, other researchers, and federal, state, and college officials, considered campusclimate surveys a useful tool for learning more about the incidence of campus sexual assault and identifying areas for improvement to address it. St stakeholders GAO spoke with generally agreed thatcampus climate surveys provide an opportunity to learn more about incidents of sexual assault occurring on individual campuses, such as those that students may not have previously reported to campus authorities or law enforcement. However, stakeholders also noted that colleges face a variety of challenges with developing and conducting surveys, including limited access to needed survey expertise and low response rates, which can affect the reliability of campus climate survey results. For example, one college reported that the $10 incentives offered to students who completed the survey constituted the college's largest survey expense. The seven selected colleges that conducted surveys reported response rates ranging from less than 10 percent to more than 60 percent. Additionally, officials in two of the selected states reported that their survey response rates were not high enough to generalize or draw meaningful conclusions regarding campus sexualviolence, as originally intended. Officials in these states said they primarily included the data in required state reports, with limitations noted as needed. Federal agencies have provided information to colleges about developing and implementing campus climate Surveys on Sexual Violence on Campus, among other efforts. For instance, Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics and Office on Violence Against Women funded the development of a free and reliable survey instrument to collect school-level data on campus climate and sexual victimization. In 2017, Justice also collaborated with HHS's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide funding and project planning assistance for a pilot study to develop and test acampus climate survey for use at two Historically Black Colleges and Universities. According to Justice and HHS officials, this survey instrument was based on the validated Justice survey instrument, with some modifications made to the campus climate questions. In October 2019, Justice officials told GAO the agency had decided not to proceed with funding for the study due to concerns that modifications to the original validated survey instrument would result in data that are not comparable to data from the validation study. In addition, Justice has developed technical assistance materials for colleges interested in conducting a campusclimate survey. For examples, Justice issued talking points to help college administrators and students communicate about climate surveys and a frequently asked questions sheet to help colleges develop survey content.
Since 1976, the Magnuson-Stevens Act has required NMFS to establish and revise allocations for the commercial and recreational fishing sectors in federal waters of the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. In 2016, NMFS issued a fisheries allocation review policy, which called for reviewing and potentially revising allocations to ensure that fishery management plan objectives are being met. NMFS also established a multi-step process to review and potentially revise fisheries allocations. GAO was asked to review NMFS's allocation review process. This report examines (1) the extent to which the councils have established and revised allocations for mixed-use fisheries, (2) the key sources of information that may be available to help NMFS and the councils review allocations, and (3) how the councils plan to document their allocation reviews. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed NMFS officials and staff from the councils. The South Atlantic (GAO-19-619) and Gulf (GAo-20-611) councils—the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the Department of Commerce and eight regional fishery councils in the United States and Canada—have established allocations for almost all of the fish stocks they manage in their regions and have revised allocations to varying degrees for some of those stocks. For example, in 2011, the SouthAtlantic council established an allocation for 40 of the 51 fish stocks in its region and revised the allocation for 30 stocks in 2012, according to council documents. In addition, as of December 2019, the Gulf ofMexico council had revised allocations once for two fish stocks and three times for one fish stock—for example, by increasing the recreational sector's allocation in 2013 and 2015. However, the council did not revise the allocations for three other fish stocks, such as the deep water grouper and tilefish complexes, because there has been limited competition between the recreational and commercial fishing sectors and the council has not needed to revise those allocations. Through its review of agency and council documents and interviews with agency officials and fishery stakeholders GAO found that various sources of data are available for reviewing allocations, but each source presents some challenges to councils for supporting allocation decisions. Five key sources that the councils and NMFS identified are trends in catch and landings, stock assessments, economic analyses, social indicators, and ecosystem models. Councils can use these sources to consider the factors NMFS' 2016 guidance calls for—including fishery performance and change, economic, social, and ecological factors—when reviewing allocations. For instance, in 2016 NMFS guidance called for the councils to consider whether a fishery's current or preferred allocation results in the most economically efficient use of the fishery resource, and if so, how to modify the allocation to increase economic efficiency and economic benefits to the nation. In some instances, however, the councils face challenges in using economic efficiency analyses in allocation decisions because reliable data for estimating economic values associated with recreational fishing may not be readily available. In 2018, for example, the Marine Recreational Information Program updated how NMFS estimates recreational catch based on a change in the survey methodology used to collect data from anglers. According to NMFS documents, updated recreational catch estimates for many fish stocks are several times higher than previous estimates because of the change in methodology, but any implications these updated estimates may have for allocations in the Gulf and South Atlantic may not have been fully understood until NMFS incorporates the estimates into stock assessments scheduled for completion between 2019 and 2021. In response to the 2016 guidance, the four councils each established criteria for initiating allocation reviews, but neither council has developed processes to guide how they will conduct or document their reviews. The North Pacific, Caribbean, Western Pacific, and Caribbean councils each identified public input as a potential review trigger, but they did not specify what threshold of public interest would trigger a review. The remaining two councils do not have allocations subject to the NMFS policy requiring councils to establish allocation review criteria. In April 2019, one council began taking steps to develop a process for conducting an allocation review, but it has not indicated what actions it will take, if any, regarding the workgroup's proposal. The other council postponed discussion of defining or documenting its review process until March 2020 to review GAO's report before deciding any next steps. In June 2019, a council chair questioned the need for developing a review process through policy, citing concerns that the council may be continuously developing exceptions to such a policy to accommodate fishery-specific issues
Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances health care for certain low-income, medically needy children and their families. Under the EPSDT benefit, states are required to provide a range of services, such as screening and preventive dental services, to eligible beneficiaries aged 20 and under, regardless of whether such services are covered in a state's Medicaid state plan and regardless of any restrictions that the state may impose on coverage for adult services. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for overseeing states' implementation of EPSDT. GAO was asked to review states' performance in providing EPSDT services. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which Medicaid beneficiaries received recommended EPSDT screenings and services in fiscal year 2017, and (2) CMS's oversight of states' provision of these services. To do this work, GAO analyzed state-reported data from CMS's CMS-416, Child Core Set, and Medicaid and CHIP Scorecard and interviewed CMS and state Medicaid officials in 16 states selected to provide variation in factors such as population size and geographic location. According to GAO's analysis of Medicaid data reported by states to CMS, approximately half of Medicaid beneficiaries who should have received EPSDT well-child screenings and dental services in 2017 received them. However, nearly as many beneficiaries did not receive these services, and few states met CMS's performance measure targets. For example, of the 34.2 million beneficiaries who were eligible for at least one recommended well- child screening in 2017, 59 percent received one, according to state data reported to CMS. Additionally, while available data show that millions of blood lead screenings were performed, the total number of beneficiaries receiving these screenings is unknown, because the data are incomplete. CMS has taken some actions to improve the quality of information about the provision of EPS DT services, but additional actions are needed to improve oversight of the services, particularly for blood lead screening data. CMS collects data annually from states on performance measures for both the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and EPSDT, but does not regularly assess the appropriateness of these measures for oversight. CMS also does not consistently communicate with states about performance measures and targets, evaluate state performance against these targets, or provide states with assistance in reaching these targets. As a result, CMS cannot be sure that it has the information it needs to oversee state implementation of the benefit. Federal internal control standards specify that management should identify information requirements in an iterative and ongoing manner and ensure information remains relevant. CMS officials told GAO that they are currently in discussions with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how to capture more complete information about Medicaid beneficiaries receiving screenings through programs funded by that agency, but as of February 2019, CMS officials had not identified specific actions to gather this data. The lack of complete data is inconsistent with federal internal controls standards, which specify management should obtain relevant data from reliable sources based on identified information requirements, and use such data for effective monitoring. CMS intends to use the data it collects from states to reduce the number of reports it requires states to submit and to provide more information to improve Medicaid oversight, but lacks time frames and interim milestones for using the data to streamline state reporting. CMS is unable to determine whether all eligible beneficiaries are receiving blood lead services in accordance with CMS policy because it does not collect accurate and complete data on blood lead screened beneficiaries.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides vocational rehabilitation and employment (VR&E) services to help veterans with disabilities obtain and sustain employment. VR&E counselors work with veterans to develop employment plans to help them obtain and maintain employment. GAO was asked to review the extent to which VA's counselors develop and approve employment plans for veterans. This report examines (1) how VA trains and monitors counselors to develop and approves employment plans, (2) the factors that counselors consider when developing and approving plans, and (3) what is known about the consistency of counselors' plans. GA O reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 34 case files from fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and interviewed VA officials in headquarters and three regional offices, as well as counselors in each of these offices. VA trains its counselors on developing sound and complete employment plans and monitors their performance, but does not monitor their consistency. VA's training emphasizes that plans should be individualized to accommodate the veteran's rehabilitation needs, abilities, aptitudes, and interests. To ensure that plans are complete, VA requires that each regional office review a randomly-selected subset of case files on a monthly basis. However, VA does not check for consistency among counselors for similarly-situated veterans, at either the national or local levels. VA also does not compare the output of counselors by, for example, analyzing responses to identical hypothetical cases for training or monitoring purposes. As a result, in addition to missing a training opportunity for counselors about employment plan development, the agency does not know the degree to which inconsistency among counselors occurs. For example, GAO found that counselors generally considered common factors, such as a veteran's functional limitation from disability, prior education, aptitude results, and career interests, when developing employment plans. While GAO's review of 34 cases found that these common factors were generally considered, counselors GAO interviewed acknowledged that they may apply the factors differently because of their varying backgrounds and experience levels. The variability of the counselors' experiences and veterans' circumstances may make it difficult to determine the full extent of any inconsistency, but taking steps to examine the prevalence and type of any inconsistencies among counselors would better position VA to mitigate any unfair differences in plans among veterans with similar circumstances. An understanding of how effectively and consistently counselors assist veterans will be even more important in the coming years as VA fully integrates the new counselors hired to decrease the average caseload. VA concurred with our recommendation and said that the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) will develop a consistency study of VR&e plan development.
Youth in foster care face enormous challenges in their everyday lives and school can offer a stabilizing environment. Maintaining connections with teachers and friends, in addition to remaining in a familiar academic environment, can enhance the chances that a student is academically successful. However, many children in care are at higher risk of frequently changing schools, which can affect their academic achievement. ESSA made changes to the Title I program to help improve the educational stability of youth in care. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these provisions. This report examines (1) the challenges states and selected local educational agencies face implementing the requirements of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) related to educational stability, and (2) how Education provided technical assistance and monitored states and localities to ensure compliance with these requirements, including collaborating with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). GAO surveyed state educational agencies in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; and interviewed federal, state, and local officials in three states selected to represent a mix of factors, including type of child welfare agency (state or county administered), number of children in foster Care, number of school districts, geographic dispersion, and variety in types of school Districts (urban, suburban, rural). State and local education and child welfare officials GAO interviewed reported facing several challenges related to implementing the ESSA educational stability provisions. For example, officials reported challenges with turnover among local child welfare and educational agency staff, obtaining school district input during the process for determining whether it is in a youth's best interest to remain in their school of origin (referred to as best interest determinations), providing and funding transportation, ensuring accurate identification of youth, and monitoring how school districts implement these provisions, among other challenges. In addition, while GAO did not ask on GAO's survey about the requirement to immediately enroll youth in a new school if it is determined that remaining in the school oforigin is not in their best interest, officials said they experienced challenges with immediate enrollment and records transfer for special populations of youth. The Department of Education (Education) could take steps to improve access to technical assistance to help states implement the provisions and plans to begin monitoring implementation of the provisions in fall 2020. Education provided states with technical assistance, including written guidance, webinars, and in-person meetings, and collaborated with HHS to provide states with joint non-regulatory guidance specific to the provisions. Education's Office of School Support and Accountability oversees state implementation of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, including the amendments made by ESSA. Education also provides technical assistance through the State Support Network, one of its technical assistance providers. HHS's Children's Bureau oversees state child welfare agencies' implementation of title IV-E, including provisions in the Fostering Connections Act, and also provides related technical assistance. Education officials told GAO that in 2020, they expect to fully implement the monitoring protocols for reviewing how states are implementing ESSA's provisions. According to Education officials, once the protocols are implemented, they plan to use a risk assessment approach to determine which states to review each year, and anticipate reviewing approximately nine states each year.
DOD's Corrosion Office is responsible for corrosion control and prevention of corrosion on military equipment and infrastructure. In 2018, DOD relocated the Office within its restructured acquisition and sustainment organization to better align its mission with DOD's mission for materiel readiness. The Senate Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 included a provision for GAO to review the Office of the Secretary of Defense. This report examines (1) the status of DOD's efforts to implement GAO's corrosion-related recommendations and (2) the extent to which DOD has taken action or plans to take action to implement these recommendations. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and procedures; analyzed DOD documents; and interviewed DOD officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) Corrosions Office has been relocated within the restructured Acquisition and Sustainment Organization in fiscal year 2018, but it continues to perform its statutory roles and responsibilities and is making plans for future operations. As of March 2019, DOD had taken action on 18 of the 35 recommendations GAO made to the Office in 11 products on topics such as strategic planning, performance management, and mandatory oversight reports in calendar years 2003 through 2018. For example, DOD initially concurred with 16 of those recommendations, partially concurring with 8, and non-conurred with 11. DOD planned to implement 12 additional recommendations. These planned actions include, among other actions, updating existing guidance and developing new policy or processes. DOD did not plan to implement the remaining five recommendations for a variety of reasons, such as that the Office did not have the authority over the military departments to take the recommended actions. DOD officials stated that they continue to believe the recommendations are valid. In addition, DOD is making or planning changes for some of the ways in which the Corrosional Office operates. According to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of DOD for Materiel Readiness, he is working to increase the following: corrosion advocacy throughout DOD; oversight of the Office; accountability of military departments and the Office to mitigate corrosion; and the transparency of corrosion and its alignment with materiel readyiness. CorrosION Office officials told GAO that they have not changed the way in which they carry out additional authorities identified in section 2228 of Title 10, U.S. Code, which provides for the Director of the office to provide leadership on corrosion matters, including the development of policy guidance and oversight, consistent with the Office's statutory duties and responsibilities. The Office also plans to update its long-term corrosion strategy, which was last updated in 2015, by the end of calendar year 2020, and develop a new manual on corrosion that will contain operating procedural details on conducting and recording the office's review and evaluation processes.
Abandoned hardrock mines—mines abandoned after ore is crushed and valuable minerals are extracted—are common on federal and nonfederal lands. They can pose physical safety and environmental hazards and can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to address. GAO was asked to review abandoned hardrock mine issues. This report describes (1) what is known about the number of abandoned hard rock mines in the United States; (2) federal and state agency expenditures to address these mines from fiscal years 2008 through 2017; and (3) factors that limit agencies' and stakeholders' efforts to address them. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed officials from the Forest Service, BLM, Park Service, EPA, OSMRE, and 13 western states selected for geographic diversity, higher numbers of abandoned mines, and variation in the types of hazards posed by these mines. The Forest Service generally agreed with the report. USDA and EPA provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate. Interior told GAO they had no comments. Federal and state agencies identified at least 140,652 abandoned mine features, about 89,000 of which are known to pose or may pose a physical safety or environmental hazard, as of May 2019, according to information in the federal agencies' databases. Officials from 13 states in the western United States estimated that they have about 246,000 abandoned mines in their states, including about 126,000 that may pose physical or environmental hazards. Federal agencies spent, on average, about $287 million annually, or a total of about $2.9 billion, to identify, clean up, and monitor hazards at abandoned mine sites from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) spent 80 percent of the total federal expenditures—$2.3 billion—to address environmental hazards at 394 sites. Of this total, approximately $1 billion was reimbursed by responsible parties, such as state agencies, for work at five sites, and $983 million (43 percent) was spent to address physical safety hazards at five other sites. The Park Service spent about $105 million to address mine features that posed physical safety hazard, and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Park Service (Park Service), and Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) spent over $232 million (about $40 million) to address various environmental hazards on lands they manage. The Department of the Interior's (Interior) Forest Service and BLM estimated that it could cost over $650 million to finish inventorying abandoned mines on lands it manages. BLM and Park Service officials said they estimated that the remaining $86 million would be needed to address hazards at the approximately 380,000 additional features that may be on BLM-managed land but are not in their databases. EPA did not have estimates for future costs to address additional mine features. Federal agency officials, state officials from three selected states (Colorado, Montana, and Nevada), and stakeholders GAO interviewed cited the availability of resources and legal liability concerns as factors that have limited efforts to identify and address hazardous hazards at Abandoned Hardrock Mines. For example, BLM officials estimated that with the agency's current abandoned mine budget and staff resources, it could take up to 500 years to confirm the presence of hazards at approximately 66,000 features in its database and the estimated 380,00 additional features not yet captured in the database. In addition, state agency officials and stakeholders said that they generally do not participate in projects to address hazardous mine features because of concerns about potential legal liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA) and the Clean Water Act. In the absence of legislative changes, EPA officials are looking for new ways to encourage Good Samaritans to participate in abandoned mine projects. These parties— entities that offer assistance in addressing environmental hazards that they did not create and are not legally required to clean up—may include states, nongovernmental organizations, local governments, private landowners, and mining companies.
The U.S. government borrows money by issuing Treasury securities to finance the federal deficit (i.e., the difference between current spending and revenues), which includes paying interest on outstanding debt, and refinancing maturing debt. Treasury issues securities in a wide range of maturities to appeal to a broad range of investors, and in sufficient amounts to promote liquid markets so investors can easily buy and sell Treasury securities. GAO was asked to review the Treasury market. This report examines (1) key characteristics of Treasury securities and how they support reliable demand for Treasury securities, (2) changes in market conditions that could affect demand, and (3) the extent to which Treasury has policies governing key market outreach and analytical modeling to inform debt issuance decisions. To address these objectives, GAO surveyed 109 market participants and interviewed Treasury officials and subject matter experts across 10 sectors and the 15 largest mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The combination of the liquidity, depth, and safety of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) market is unmatched in global markets and makes Treasury securities a unique and critical asset for many investors. Market participants and subject-matter experts GAO interviewed and surveyed identified these three key characteristics as the most important. The importance of these characteristics was consistent across sectors, as they support a variety of business practices and needs. For example, Treasury securities serve as a close substitute to cash for financial institutions and corporate treasurers, are one of the most widely used forms of collateral for financial transactions, and are a benchmark for pricing many other financial products, such as corporate bonds, derivatives, and mortgages. Changes in the composition of Treasury market participants or market conditions—especially to the extent those changes significantly affect the combination of liquidity, Depth, and Safety—could raise new and important risks that could degrade the unique advantages of this market. These include risks from a future debt limit impasse, the sustainability of the federal debt, the dollar's status as the primary reserve currency, and changes in the structure of the market which might affect liquidity, all of which could degrade Treasury's unique advantages. Treasury must regularly make important debt issuance decision to maintain broad-based demand and support its goal of borrowing at the lowest cost over time. Treasury relies on three key inputs to help analyze financing options and inform these decisions: market outreach, auction and market metrics, and analytical models. However, Treasury lacks policies governing some of these key inputs. Specifically, Treasury's draft policy for bilateral market outreach does not include guidance on systematically selecting and documenting these interactions. Furthermore, Treasury does not have a policy governing important aspects of its analytical modeling, including requiring that analyses are documented and that Treasury staff follow and document appropriate quality assurance steps. A policy requiring appropriate documentation and quality assurance would help Treasury ensure that analytical methods, data, assumptions, limitations, and uncertainties are transparent, appropriate, and available to future model developers and users. In addition, Treasury is working to develop improved data on the secondary market.
DOE operates three gaseous diffusion plants—Portsmouth, Paducah, and Oak Ridge—that were built in the 1940s and 1950s to enrich uranium for the U.S. military as well as the nation's domestic nuclear power industry. The GDPs were rendered obsolete due to the emergence of newer, more efficient technologies and the globalization of the uranium enrichment market. In 1992, Congress created the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) as a government corporation authorized to, among other things, acquire, market, and enrich uranium. In 1996, Congress enacted the USEC Privatization Act authorizing establishment of a private, for-profit corporation. USEC was privatized on July 28, 1998. After privatization, the balance of the US EC Fund was retained on the books of the Treasury and has grown to an estimated $1.695 billion as of fiscal year 2020. In 2015, GAO found that the entire balance of this fund is available for permanent rescission since the two statutorily authorized uses for the fund have been fulfilled: (1) environmental clean-up expenses pursuant to the “McConnell Act,” and (2) expenses of privatization. GAO has previously found that DOE's effort to utilize USEC Fund monies instead of general fund appropriations to support efforts other than the authorized purpose of the fund would diminish transparency in budgeting. DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM) is responsible for managing the cleanup of the three GDPs—Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended. Cleanup of the GDPs began in the late 1980s and is expected to be completed by 2070 at the latest, according to EM. DOE estimates that cleanup will take 33 years at Oak Ridge, 52 years at Portsmouth, and 77 to 82 years atPaducah. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state regulators from Kentucky and Tennessee are involved in negotiations with EM regarding various cleanup decisions, which have strained relations between EM and regulators and present challenges to the GDP cleanup progress. The EPA and state regulatory officials said that their negotiations over pending cleanup decisions have raised concerns regarding EM's priorities, cleanup remedies, and cost estimates. As of February 2019, these and other technical disputes had delayed demolition of the C-400 building—the primary source of groundwater contamination at the Padukah site—by a year and led to cost increases. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOE and EPA officials stated that disputes associated with the building demolition were resolved in a memorandum of agreement signed in August 2019. EM reported it has spent at least $15.5 billion on cleanup at the three cleanup sites as of 2018, including approximately $5.1 billion on the Oak Ridge GDP, approximately $6.7 billion on Portsmouth's GDP, and approximately $3.7 million on the Paduah GDP. However, EM has limited detailed expenditure data on the cleanup activities carried out at each site, and its cost estimates for completing cleanup are not reliable because they do not fully or substantially meet all of the characteristics of a high-quality, reliable cost estimate as described in GAO's Cost Estimating Guide. EM's 2019 triennial report to Congress on the sufficiency of the D&D Fund is based on outdated information, provides limited information on the challenges EM faces in reaching agreement with regulators, and is not clear on the scope of work, thereby reducing the quality of the information Congress receives for making decisions about allocating resources to the fund at the same time that Congress will have to address a continued need for resources for GDP cleanup given the fund is estimated to be exhausted by 2020.
The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) within the Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for developing a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to defend the United States against ballistic and hypersonic missile attacks. MDA's mission is to combine a number of systems into an integrated system-of-systems known as the BMDS. GAO was asked to testify on its preliminary observations from its fiscal year 2019 review of MDAs progress in developing and delivering BMDS capabilities. This testimony is based on GAO products issued from May 2017 through June 2019, including selected updates conducted in June 2019. For the updates, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, and procedures and interviewed officials from MDA, the military services, the defense intelligence community, and other key stakeholders. The Missile Defense Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No. 109-375) requires GAO to review and report annually on the status of the Department's efforts to develop, acquire, test, and deploy BMDS systems. This statement focuses on (1) the extent to which MDA has taken steps to improve management practices, reduce acquisition risks, and deliver BMDS capability; and (2) ongoing challenges MDA faces to improve transparency and reduce high-risk acquisition practices. To address these objectives, in prior reports GAO has made numerous recommendations aimed at improving management practices and reducing acquisition risks. The Department has taken important actions to increase transparency, reduce high risk approaches in its management of BMDS elements, and test and deliver capability. For example, MDA improved reporting in its annual progress reports to the Congress and made advances across a broad range of management activities, including the involvement of stakeholders, reducing concurrency, and continued efforts to improve key aspects of testing necessary to demonstrate delivered capability. However, as GAO reported in December 2019 (GAO-19-387), MDA continues to face challenges in aligning itself with best practices for acquisitions. For instance, while MDA increased its outreach to stakeholders over the past few years, opportunities remain for further engagement on key decisions. In addition, although MDA is not required to obtain the intelligence community's input, the community is uniquely positioned to assist MDA keep pace with rapidly emerging threats. Moreover, this limited insight has, in part, prevented validation of threat models that MDA uses to assess BMDS performance. Without validation, any flaws or bias in the threat models may go undetected, which can have significant implications for the performance of the weapon systems. In May 2017 and December 2019 GAO also recommended that the agency strengthen its collaboration with other stakeholders, such as the warfighting community and independent cost and technical experts. In the early stages of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (P.L. 112-81), Congress directed MDA to take steps to reduce concurrency. Concurrency is broadly defined as the overlap of development, testing, and production; coupled with an aggressive testing schedule. In some cases, concurrent development has often left the agency committing to production and fielding before development is complete. This approach has resulted in performance shortfalls, cost increases, and schedule delays. M DA is currently at a pivotal crossroads, needing to balance its ability to pursue new and advanced efforts while also maintaining its existing portfolio of elements that have not transferred to the military service as originally planned. The new efforts, including a Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), are research and development-intensive tasks, which carry significant technical risks and financial commitments. If these elements are not transferred as originally intended, as they move further into production and operations and sustainment these elements will continue to consume a growing portion of the agency's budget. Congress and the Secretary of Defense have directed multiple reviews to determine how to address these concerns and chart a path forward for MDA.
In 1995, the U.S. government established the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) program to equip Russia and other countries with modern nuclear material security systems and promote effective nuclear security practices. In 2014, the Russian government ended nearly all nuclear security cooperation with the United States. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) had planned to continue to provide MPC&A assistance to Russia until 2018. GAO was asked to review the status of nuclear security efforts in Russia. This report (1) examines the extent to which NNSA's planned nuclear materialsecurity efforts were completed when cooperation ended and what nuclear security concerns remained, (2) describes what is known about the current state of Russian nuclear security, and (3) describes stakeholder views on potential opportunities for future cooperation. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed NNSA documents and interviewed officials from NNSA, the Department of Energy (DOE), the State Department, and the Departments of Defense and State, as well as nongovernmental experts. NNSA had no comments on a draft of this report. Based on a review of available NNSA documentation and interviews with project team personnel and stakeholders at the 25 Russian nuclear material sites where NNSA and the national laboratories had previously worked with Russia to improve security, NNSA completed many—but not all—site-level nuclear security projects at the Russian sites. For example, project team members told GAO that some planned work was not completed before cooperation ended, such as the development of regulations to improve the security of nuclear materials in transit. In addition, project officials said that NNSA made progress on 11 cross-cutting projects that were intended to improve Russia's national-level security infrastructure. However, at the time cooperation ended in 2014, some of these projects had not been completed, and NNSA was unable to provide complete documentation detailing the level of progress for some of them. As part of its plan to shift responsibility for nuclear security to Russia, in 2010 GAO issued a classified report that found that the 25 sites had made limited progress in improving security at these sites and faced challenges in developing effective practices and procedures consistent with seven "sustainability elements." GAO's December 2019 classified report reviewed the most recent sustainability assessments, largely conducted between 2012 and 2014, and found that sustainability ratings generally improved, but low scores persisted at many sites and in some sustainability areas. Stakeholders GAO interviewed said that there could be opportunities to help Russia improve aspects of its nuclear security system that were identified as continuing risks. For instance, some stakeholders said that Russia's nuclear security culture generally does not prioritize protection against the threat of nuclear material theft by insiders, a threat that modern nuclear security systems are designed and maintained to prevent. According to stakeholders, there is little specific information available about the state of security at Russian sites, though anecdotal evidence suggests that security regulations have improved and that Russia has funded some security efforts. St stakeholders also noted that there are some limitations to the current level of information available on Russian security, including the extent of compliance with regulations and the effectiveness of enforcement in cases of noncompliance. St stakeholders said that any future cooperation with Russia would likely be limited in scope and would face considerable political challenges. For the most part, stakeholders said the current political and diplomatic climate is the most significant challenge to cooperation, and it is not clear whether Russia is prepared to reengage on options for rekindling such cooperation. For some stakeholders, the lack of access to Russian nuclear sites and the prohibition on NNSA funding has been the primary obstacle to cooperation. Stakesholders identified opportunities for cooperation that could help address some of the continuing nuclear security risks in Russia, but they noted that the scope of future cooperation would likely differ dramatically from the donor-recipient model of the past NNSA program.
In 1990, Congress enacted the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act), which was the most comprehensive and far-reaching financial management improvement legislation enacted since the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950. The CFO Act established a Controller position at the government-wide level and a Chief Financial Officer position for each of the agencies identified in the act, provided for long-range planning, and began the process of preparing and independently auditing federal agency financial statements. The act also called for systematic performance measurement and cost information. Since 1990, the federal government has made substantial progress toward improving financial management and achieving the purposes of the act. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) have led reform efforts by developing and periodically updating guidance and initiatives in areas such as financial management systems, auditing, financial reporting, internal control, and grants management. In addition, OMB, Treasury, and GAO have regularly provided guidance to agencies that improves transparency, consistency, and usefulness of financial reporting. GAO was asked to testify on its preliminary observations on the status of federal financial management. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing review and analysis of relevant legislation, federal guidance, reports on financial management issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), agency offices of inspector general, and others; summarization of interviews and a panel discussion with financial experts; and results of GAO surveys of federal chief financial officers, inspectors general, accountants, and public accountants. Since GAO began preparing its consolidated financial statements over 20 years ago, three major impediments have continued to prevent GAO from rendering an opinion on the U.S. government's accrual-based financial statements: (1) serious financial management problems at the Departmentof Defense (DOD) have prevented its financial statements from being auditable; (2) while significant progress has been made over the past few years, the government continues to be unable to adequately account for intragovernmental activity and balances between federal entities; (3) the government has an ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statement; and (4) significant uncertainties, primarily related to achieving projected reductions in Medicare cost growth, and a material weakness in internal control prevented GAO, in connection with its audits, and agency auditors, in conjunction with their audits, from expressing an opinion in 2018 on the sustainability of the government's consolidated financial Statements of the United States Government. While substantial progress has already been made, additional attention is needed in several areas to help fully achieve the vision of the CFO act and, in doing so, improve and modernize federal financial Management. Based on the preliminary results from its ongoing review, GAO has identified several opportunities for enhancements that could help ensure that the act reaches its full potential. For example, to help ensure uniform responsibility, enhance strategic decision-making, and correct inconsistencies across government, amend agency CFO's statutory responsibilities to ensure that they include all of the responsibilities necessary to effectively carry out financial management activities. To help ensure continuity in agency financial management operations when CFO vacancies occur, establish appropriate statutory responsibilities for deputy CFOs. To provide more complete and consistent measurement of the quality of agencies' financial management, require OMB to develop, in consultation with the Chief Information Officer Council, key selected performance-based metrics to assess thequality of an agency's financial management (e.g., number of internal control deficiencies corrected during the year and Antideficiency Act violations).
The Corps plans, constructs, operates, and maintains a wide range of water resources development projects, such as navigation and flood risk projects. GAO was asked to review the Corps' implementation of the WRRDA 2014 reforms. This report examines the extent to which the Corps has (1) addressed the feasibility study acceleration provisions, (2) reviewed the impact of its feasibility study reforms, and (3) maintained complete milestone data for feasibility studies in its central data system. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed the first 19 feasibility studies subject to the WR RDA 2014 provisions, including those that were initiated after June 10, 2014, the date the act was enacted, through August 15, 2018, and for which an environmental impact statement (EIS) was prepared. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has taken steps to address broad provisions in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA) related to facilitating the process of coordinating and administering feasibility studies by, for example, encouraging the Corps and other agencies to coordinate early in the study process and resolve issues expeditiously. For example, in September 2015, as a result of the act and previous ongoing coordination efforts, the Corps, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) worked together to jointly issue a coordination guide for conducting feasibility studies. The guide emphasizes the importance of substantive, early engagement among the three agencies to successfully deliver projects and avoid delays later in the process that may result from lingering disagreements among the agencies. The Corps also issued guidance on how to implement the act's acceleration provisions in March 2018. Corps headquarters officials said they have not conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of the agency's reforms to determine what impacts the reforms have had and whether any modifications to those reforms are needed. Developing an evaluation plan would help position the Corps to conduct a timely and effective review of the effects of the reforms overall. For the 19 studies GAO examined, seven studies included complete data on all 10 key milestones for feasibility study initiation, and twelve studies were missing one or more milestones in the data system for more than half of the studies reviewed. Corps officials said agency policy requires district officials conducting studies to enter data on 10 milestones for each study into the agency’s central data systems. However, while the policy identifies the 10 milestones, it only explicitly requires that two of the milestones be entered into the system. Many Corps headquarters, division, and district officials GAO interviewed also acknowledged that the milestone information entered in the system can be inconsistent across different studies. Without clarifying its policy to help ensure district officials enter all key milestone dates for studies into its central system, the agency will continue to lack complete data to efficiently monitor the progress of studies.
The VH-92A presidential helicopter is the Navy's most costly and ambitious aircraft acquisition, seeking to replace a fleet of 23 legacy helicopters that have been in service for decades. In April 2014, the Navy awarded a fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. The contract includes a ceiling price of $1.3 billion that limits the maximum amount that the Navy may have to pay the contractor under the contract subject to other contract terms. The program is expected to provide improved performance, survivability, and communications capabilities, while offering increased passenger capacity when compared to the current helicopters. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision for GAO to review the VH -92A program annually for 5 years. This is GAO's fifth report. This report examines (1) the status of the program's development and (2) the estimated cost and schedule for the program. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed program documents and interviewed program officials. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. DOD provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Navy continue to make progress in developing the next generation of presidential helicopters, referred to as the V H- 92A. As of January 2019, the program had accomplished about 83.3 percent of its development work, with the remainder to be completed by October 2020. The Navy is now more than halfway through its ground and flight testing requirements needed to support Milestone C, the decision point for entering into low-rate initial production. While the program has made progress, it continues to face development challenges that could affect its ability to deliver fully capable aircraft prior to the start of initial operational test and evaluation. Those challenges include issues associated with the aircraft's start procedures for the propulsion system, landing zone suitability, mission communications system interoperability with secure networks, and performance requirements that may not be fully achieved until after the low rate initial production decision currently planned for June 2019, which may result in a need to retrofit already built aircraft. The total program acquisition cost estimate has decreased $234 million or about 4.5 percent—from $5.18 billion to $4.95 billion (then-year dollars)—since the program started in April 2014. Contractor officials attribute the estimated decline in cost to stable requirements, a low number of design changes, and streamlined processes and reviews. Program officials told GAO they have adjusted schedule milestones and are on track to meet key performance parameters, including providing a fully interoperable mission communications systems (MCS) in time for initial operational testing in 2020.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates 167 land border crossings along the northern and southern borders. CBP is responsible for facilitating trade and travel, and enforcing immigration and customs laws at these crossings. GAO was asked to review CBP's land border crossing infrastructure. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which CBP has identified infrastructure constraints at land border border crossings, (2) how CBP and GSA have addressed those constraints, and (3) how, if at all, CBP prioritizes and prioritizes projects in its annual five-year capital investment plans. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed CBP documents and interviewed CBP, GSA, and other federal agency officials at a nongeneralizable sample of 16 land border Crossing Capital Infrastructure Projects that were active during fiscal years 2014 through 2018. These projects were selected based on a variety of factors, such as the number of people entering and exiting the United States at each crossing and the amount of cargo and passenger vehicles processed at the crossing, among others, and were selected to represent eight border crossing locations across eight locations in the southern and northern borders. The results of GAO's review are not generalizable but provide insight into the condition of CBP-owned and leased infrastructure at these locations. The Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS) U.S.-based CBP relies on infrastructure to fulfill its mission to facilitate travel and trade at the nation’s 167 landborder crossings. According to CBP officials, well-functioning infrastructure is a critical factor in its ability to effectively screen persons and cargo, and facilitate cross-border travel. In 2017, for example, the agency processed over 252 million vehicle and pedestrian entries and nearly $721 billion in traded goods (imports and exports) through land border ports of entry, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). CBP officers GAO spoke with at 16 border crossings and field offices that oversee these crossings reported various infrastructure constraints they face at each stage of the inspection process, including preprimary, primary, and secondary inspections. These officers identified limited space in the preprimary inspection area and limited technology in the primary inspection area. For example, at a land border cross on the southern border, license plate readers and radiation portal monitors are inoperable at least once a week during summer months due to overheating due to temperatures exceeding 120 degrees Fahrenheit and the technology is exposed to the sun. Inadequate holding facilities in the secondary inspection area did not meet current CBP safety requirements, and officers stated they may perform manual inspections of vehicles when non-intrusive inspection (NII) technology is not available, which they noted can be less effective. In addition, officers identified challenges with facilitating traffic flow within the border crossing, including a layout that impedes the flow of traffic because it requires commercial trucks to make a series of sharp turns as they travel through the border crossings. The General Services Administration (GSA) and CBP conduct facility condition assessments (FCAs) to assess the condition and identify repair and improvement needs at each of the 167 land Border Crossings, but they do not routinely share information with each other to inform their assessments of facility condition. For the 95 FCAs CBP conducted between 2016 and 2018, the assessments identified approximately $140 million in estimated infrastructure deficiencies and the average facility condition index (the ratio of the costs to correct facility infrastructure deficiencies to the total replacement value of the facility) ranged from 0 percent to 69 percent across the 95 assessments. By developing and implementing a plan to ensure CBP executes its FCA program consistent with DHS policy, which requires CBP to conduct FCAs every three years, and by sharing and using certain relevant information with GSA on GSA-owned land crossing infrastructure, both agencies would be better positioned to improve the accuracy and completeness of their respective assessments of infrastructure condition. In its annual Five-Year Land Port of Entry Capital Investment Plan (five-year plan), CBP identifies the five broad steps it is to take in general to develop a list of priority projects each year and establish an annual plan and these steps are documented at a high level. However, the plans do not define what minimum steps CBP personnel are to take at each step in the process and do not include time frames for completing each step. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should define objectives so
Indian Affairs, BIA, BIE, and IHS are among the federal agencies that provide services and benefits to tribes and their members. In fiscal year 2018, the federal government provided about $1.3 billion to these agencies for a variety of programs and services, such as education, health care, and energy. GAO has previously reported on a range of issues related to federal programs that serve tribes, including high-risk areas that are vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, high staff vacancies, and inadequate funding. This statement discusses (1) the extent to which federal programs serving tribes are effective in meeting the needs of Native Americans and (2) management weaknesses that hinder effective delivery of some federal programs for tribes. The statement is based on prior GAO reports issued from January 2013 through March 2019, including selected updates conducted in November 2019. To conduct these updates, GAO reviewed agency documents, interviewed agency officials, and interviewed tribal and non-tribal stakeholders. The Department of the Interior's (Interior) Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Indian Health Service (IHS) have made some progress in addressing recommendations GAO made to improve tribal programs identified in its high risk and other areas. For example, in January 2019, IHS established an Office of Quality which includes divisions for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls, Quality Assurance, Innovation and Improvement, and Patient Safety and Clinical Risk Management. In addition, in March 2019 GAO reported that the three agencies demonstrated progress to partially meet all five criteria for addressing high risk issues: leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, monitoring, and demonstrated progress. Federal agency capacity, funding constraints, and budget uncertainty limit effective delivery for some programs serving Native Americans. For instance, in November 2016 GAO found that BIA had high staff vacancy rates at some agency offices and that the agency had not conducted key workforce planning activities to ensure its workforce resources are appropriately deployed. In March 2018, GA O reported that IHS had over 1,550 vacancies for various health care positions nationwide in 2016, and officials said the agency's insufficient workforce was the biggest impediment to providing timely primary care. IHS has made progress in demonstrating it has the capacity necessary to address the program risks GAO identified in these reports. In February 2017 GAO added improving federal management of programs that service tribes to GAO's high risk list of federal areas most vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse or mismanagement and in need of transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges. In particular, it found numerous challenges facing BIE and BIA in administering education and health care services, that put the health and safety of American Indians served by these programs at risk. Further, in May 2017, we reported that Indian Affairs did not have a comprehensive long-term capital asset plan to guide funding for construction projects to maintain, repair, or replace infrastructure at its 185 BIE schools and recommended that it develop such a plan. Indian Affairs agreed with the recommendation and as of October 2018 provided a list of deferred maintenance projects for 2018 and documentation of processes for prioritizing such projects, among other things, but as of November 2019 had not yet provided documentation that it had completed a comprehensive plan. In June 2015, we found shortcomings in BIA's management of permits, and other approvals for energy development that have led to lengthy review times and negatively impacted energy development on tribal lands. These lengthy reviewtimes have increased energy development costs for tribes, delayed projects, and led to lost revenue, among others. In January 2018, we recommended that Interior develop a documented process to track its review and response times and enhance its data collection efforts. As of November 2018, Interior had taken initial steps toward implementing the recommendation by developing system enhancements to capture key dates during the review and approval process for energy-related documents. However, the agency needs to collect data from its system, develop time frames, and monitor agency performance to fully address these recommendations. In our January 2019 work on tribal self-governance, we also found that Interior's process does not ensure that funds associated with self-determination contracts and self- Governance compacts are disbursed in a timely manner, according to tribal stakeholders. When funds are not disbursed in a time frame, a tribal stakeholder told us that tribes may have to use funds from their general revenue accounts or seek other sources to cover federal program expenses. According to several tribal stakeholders, when a tribe has
In March 2017, the President issued an executive order requiring comprehensive reorganization plans for executive branch agencies. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the General Services Administration (GSA) are among those agencies that have been tasked with developing these plans. OMB, in coordination with the President's Management Council, was to establish a way to track the progress of the reforms. GAO was asked to testify on the status of the reorganization of OPM. This testimony is based on GAO's March 2019 report (GAO-19-919 ) and addresses (1) the extent to which the administration has addressed key reform practices in reorganizing OPM, (2) the capacity to identify trends affecting the future of the federal workforce, (3) OPM's capacity to effectively collaborate and coordinate with key stakeholders to address government-wide human capital challenges, and (4) OMB's and GSA's views on what legal authority, including appropriations, they are relying on to reorganize OPM and any additional authority that may be needed. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed OMB and OPM documents and interviewed officials from these agencies, as well as other relevant stakeholders. The administration is planning to transfer certain OPM functions to GSA and the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and transfer the remaining functions to DOD. The President's fiscal year 2020 budget proposal, which was issued in March 2019, states that the administration plans to complete the OPM reorganization by the end of fiscal year (FY) 2020. As such, the budget proposal provided no funds for OPM for FY 2020. However, on May 16, 2019, the administration proposed new legislation requesting authority to fully implement its reorganization proposal. As GAO previously reported, a critical first step in the reform and reorganization process is to define the benefits of the merger, and describe how the future will be both different from and better than the past. As of May 17, 2019 (May 17, 2018), the administration had not fully established outcome-oriented goals and performance measures for, or assessed the costs and benefits of, the proposed reorganization. Specifically, GSA provided one document, a draft Qualitative Business Case and Value Proposition for the GSA/HRS Merger (October 2018), which includes some preliminary goals and measures, such as to improve customer satisfaction. In addition, this document explicitly states that it is not a cost-benefit analysis, and OMB staff have told GAO that they have not conducted a costbenefit analysis of the reform. In prior work on organizational mergers and transformations, we have found that establishing a coherent mission and integrated strategic goals to guide the transformation involves adopting leading practices for results-oriented strategic planning and reporting. OPM has a key role in the creation, execution, oversight, and strengthening of human capital policies and programs. While many day-to-day human capital responsibilities have been delegated from OPM to individual agencies over the years, OPM continues to play an important strategic role in human capital management. For example, its strategic goals are to: Transform hiring, pay, and benefits across the federal government to attract and retain the best civilian workforce. Lead the establishment and modernization of human resource information technology and data management systems and solutions. Improve integration and communication of OMB services to federal agencies to meet emerging needs. Optimize agency performance. To carry out these governmentwide, strategic responsibilities, the following capabilities, whether possessed by OPM or some other entity, will be essential for ensuring cost-effective leadership, management, and oversight of the workforce. The capacity to Identify Trends affecting the Future of the Federal Workforce. In March 2019 , GAO noted that such trends as technological advances, an increased reliance on nonfederal partners, and changing demographics and shifting attitudes toward work, are affecting how federal work is done, and consequently the skills and competencies that workers need to accomplish agency missions. In particular, recent publications by the administration and others have raised concerns about whether the government's employment policies and practices are still relevant and desirable to the current and future workforce. As far back as 1989, we reported that OPM had not provided the leadership necessary to sustain attention to identifying and resolving critical human resource problems affecting government operations and preparing for the future. Although OMB has made progress in this area and provides a variety of services, its progress has been inconsistent and issues still
TSA's Insider Threat Program aims to deter, detect, and mitigate insider threats to the nation's transportation sector personnel, operations, information, and critical infrastructure, such as aviation workers. Insider threats include individuals who gain unauthorized access to security-restricted areas of an airport or aircraft and use this access to commit criminal acts, including attempted acts of terrorism. GAO was asked to review TSA's efforts to address insider threats. This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent to which TSA has a strategic plan to guide its insider threat program and (2) TSA's recent efforts to oversee and facilitate insider threat mitigation at commercial airports. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed TSA documents and interviewed TSA officials about TSA's insider threat efforts. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has multiple ongoing efforts to mitigate the insider threat of aviation workers accessing security- restricted areas of U.S. commercial airports, but it does not have a Strategic Plan with strategic goals and objectives to guide these efforts. In 2013, TSA established its Insider threat program, which is comprised of multiple offices across the agency that are responsible for different portions of the mission of deterring, detecting, and mitigating insider threats in the aviation sector. However, TSA did not fully implement its 2014-2016 Insider Threat Action Plan and did not renew or revise it after 2016 due to the departure of the key sponsoring senior leader. TSA is aware of the importance of strategic planning and has taken steps to strategically plan for other programmatic efforts at the agency. For example, in 2018, TSA published its Administrator's Intent to outline how TSA planned to execute its agency-wide strategy in the short term. The Intent includes one strategic objective to modernize elements of TSA's Insider threat Program, including the Insider Threat Unit. TSA also published the Cybersecurity Roadmap 2018, which details its efforts to protect its information technology infrastructure from adversaries who might seek to cause harm. Each of these strategic planning documents contains elements related to insider threats and can be drawn upon to help develop a comprehensive strategic plan that encompasses the myriad of activities across TSA's many offices that compose the program. Federal internal control standards establish that management should define the entity's objectives clearly and in alignment with its mission and strategic plan, including strategic goals. TSA has not developed a comprehensive set of performance goals that can be used to assess progress toward achieving the program's stated mission, as called for by the Office of Management and Budget guidance. Without performance goals, TSA cannot assess the progress of the overall insider threat effort, target areas most in need of improvement, and select appropriate levels of investment. TSA officials said that they are drafting a new strategic roadmap for the program but are uncertain when it will be issued.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) plans for human spaceflight have changed three times over the last 15 years. These plans have shifted back and forth between conducting a human lunar landing in order to inform the longer-term goal of human exploration of Mars and a mission that sends astronauts to an asteroid boulder in orbit around the Moon but does not include a lunar landing. GAO has found that NASA has faced challenges developing systems capable of transporting humans to space over the past two decades. These include development efforts under NASA's prior human space flight program—the Constellation program—which was canceled in the face of acquisition problems and funding-related issues. More recently, NASA has struggled to complete its current human space Flight programs—Orion, the Space Launch System (SLS), and Exploration Ground Systems—within their established cost and schedule baselines. In 2018, GAO found that all three programs have been at risk of cost growth since NASA approved their baselines, and have since experienced cost growth and schedule delays. This was in part because NASA did not follow best practices for establishing cost and Schedule baselines for these programs, including not updating cost and schedules to reflect new risks. NASA has initiated multiple programs to help the agency achieve its planned return to the Moon. These programs include a platform in the lunar orbit, a landing system to put humans on the surface of the Moon, and robotic lunar landing services. The Gateway program aims to build a sustainable platform in lunar orbit to support human lunar exploration and scientific experiments by NASA and its commercial and international partners. NASA is planning for Gateway to maneuver to different orbits around the moon, which will allow access to a variety of locations on the lunar surface. The Human Landing System, or lunar landers, is to provide crew transportation from Gateway to the moon's surface and back and demonstrate capabilities required for deep space missions. The SLS is to launch the Orion crew capsule and cargo beyond low-Earth orbit, including to Gateway. The Exploration Ground System is to deliver a robotic lunar rover for long duration operations to investigate volatiles—which include water, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that boil at low temperatures—at the lunar South Pole that could be used to support sustained human presence on the Lunar surface. In March 2019, NASA announced that it would accelerate the date for the first human moon landing from 2028 to 2024. NASA made several changes to its prior lunar plans to increase the speed of developing the systems needed to meet the aggressive timeline. For example, NASA reduced the scope of the Gateway program for Phase 1 by deferring or eliminating components and changing its configuration. NASA also removed a component that an international partner had planned to contribute and deferred work on a habitation component and other potential international contributions to Phase 2. Acknowledging that some elements of Gateway had to be deferred or eliminated is a positive step NASA has taken to try to achieve an aggressive schedule. In some cases, NASA changed the acquisition strategy to increase its speed of development work. However, NASA does not plan to competitively award a contract for the Gateway Habitation and Logistics Outpost, citing the aggressive schedule as a factor for this decision. NASA faces integration challenges because it has not fully defined a system architecture or established requirements for its lunar mission. A system architecture, among other things, defines the dependencies and interfaces between the components. The NASA systems engineering handbook states that defining the system architecture early enables NASA to develop components separately from each other while ensuring that they work together effectively to achieve top-level requirements. NASA's approach of defining the lunar architecture and associated requirements concurrently with programs setting their own requirements presents the risk of mismatches of requirements across and within programs. Such mismatches increase the risk for technical problems, schedule delays, and cost overruns. NASA officials stated that they plan to define the lunar system architecture in an architecture definition document and the lunar mission requirements in six separate HEOMD documents, which are in various stages of completion, but have not committed to a completion date.
In January 2017, the President issued Executive Order 13769, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States (EO-1), which introduced new visa entry restrictions and requirements to enhance screening and vetting, including for nonimmigrants (NIVs). The President revoked and replaced EO-1 in March 2017 with the issuance of Executive Order13780, which suspended entry of certain foreign nationals for a 90-day period, subject to exceptions and waivers, and imposed certain conditional restrictions and limitations on the entry of nationals of eight countries—Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and Yemen—for an indefinite period. These restrictions, identified in table 1, are to remain in effect until the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State determine that a country provides sufficient information to assess adequately whether its nationals pose a security or safety threat. GAO was asked to provide a statement on the actions taken in calendar year 2017 to implement EOs and Proclamation 9645, Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the U.S. by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats. This statement addresses (1) the number of NIV adjudications and refusal rates and (2) the extent to which CBP's air predeparture programs identify and interdict high-risk air travelers, including those who may be inadmissible under immigration law or who may otherwise pose a threat to homeland or national security. This testimony is based on prior GAO reports issued from August 2012 through August 2018, with selected updates conducted in December 2018 on actions taken by CBP in response to GAO's prior recommendations. For the updates, GAO reviewed CBP documentation and interviewed CBP officials. In August 2018 GAO reported that the total number of nonimmigrant applications adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, which was an increase of approximately 30 percent since fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2017 (the most recent data available at the time of the report), NIVs adjudicated decreased by about 880,000 adjudications, or about 7 percent. The percentage of applications refused—known as the refusal rate—increased from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and was about the same in fiscal years 2017 as the previous year. Most NIV applications that were refused were for reasons other than terrorism and other security-related concerns. For example, an applicant applying for a student visa could be refused as an ineligible nonimmigrant for failure to demonstrate possession of sufficient funds to cover his or her educational expenses, as required. In addition, State data indicate that 1,256 (or 0.05 percent) of the nearly 2.8 million nonimmigrant visa applications refused in 2017 were for terrorism-related reasons, of which 357 refusals were for such reasons. As GAO previously reported in January 2017 (GAO-17-611 ), the Department of Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Air Predepartures Program uses the results of the National Traveler Screening Center's (NTC's) efforts to identify and Interdict High-Risk Travelers, but CBP has not fully evaluated the effectiveness of these programs as a whole, including implementing a system of performance measures and baselines to assess whether the programs are achieving their stated goals. CBP data indicated that these programs identified and ultimately interdicted approximately 22,000 high- risk air travelers in 2015, the most recent year for which data were available. In March 2018, we reported that CBP had taken some initial steps to measure the performance of its programs but did not have baseline data on which to measure program performance. As a result, we made a recommendation to CBP to develop and implement performance measures for each program to help ensure that the programs achieve their intended goals. In response, as of December 2018, CBP collected the fiscal year 2018 data relevant to these measures, used those data to set preliminary targets for fiscal year 2019, and plans to analyze the fiscalyear 2019 results and set targets for future fiscal years by October 31, 2019. We will review documentation of CBPs analysis of these results and future targets, when available, to determine if CBP’s actions address our recommendation.
VA is undertaking an ambitious effort to reform its disability appeals process—while onboarding hundreds of new staff and implementing new technology—that will affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of veterans with disabilities for years to come. In March 2018, GAO reported that VA's November 2017 plan for implementing a new appeals process while attending to appeals under way in the current (legacy) process, addressed 17 of 22 elements required by the Act. For the 5 remaining elements, VA partially addressed 4 elements related to implementation monitoring, productivity projecting, and workforce planning, and did not address 1 element related to identifying total resources. GAO recommended in March 2018 that VA address all 22 required elements in VA's appeals plan to Congress using sensitivity analyses and results from its test, RAMP, where appropriate and needed. VA has taken some action on each of the five elements that GAO found were not fully addressed at that time. For example, VA added details related to projecting staff productivity, identified total resources, as well as determining personnel requirements and productivity projections for processing appeals. However, as of November 2018, VA's plan does not contain metrics for monitoring implementation. Until VA fully addresses all 22 elements in its appeals plan, it risks not fully understanding how well the reforms are performing. VA's most recent integrated master schedule (IMS) for the appeals reform effort does not reflect all key activities, such as modifications to information technology systems, assigned responsibilities, interdependencies, start and end dates for key activities for each workgroup, and resources, to establish accountability and reduce the overall risk of implementation failures. In addition, the IMS does not show which activities must finish prior to the start of other activities, or the amount of time an activity could be delayed before the delay affects VA's estimated implementation date. VA intends to start full implementation in February 2019, but GAO does not know the extent to which the lack of a robust schedule poses risks to successful and smooth implementation. Even if taking corrective actions to address GAO's findings may not be feasible before February, incorporating such lessons learned into future project planning could help VA improve its project scheduling capabilities. In its March 2018 report, VA has addressed many, but not all, key risks related to implementing the appeals process. For instance, while VA has developed sensitivity models and other analyses to monitor and forecast future VBA and Board workloads, production, and staffing requirements to help VA manage the legacy and new appeals processes, it has yet to specify a complete set of balanced goals and measures for monitoring the performance of the new and legacy appeals processes. VA also has not developed a plan for comparing the performance and outcomes of the two appeals processes after the new process is fully implemented. VA officials said they would develop such a plan, but they did not indicate how soon they would do so. VA is also taking steps to collect comparable information on veterans' satisfaction with the two processes through surveys.
Federal agencies rely extensively on information systems and networks to carry out their missions and carry out a wide range of critical functions. GAO was asked to review federal agencies' information security programs and practices. In this report, GAO (1) describes the reported adequacy and effectiveness of selected agencies' security policies and practices and (2) evaluates the extent to which OMB, DHS, and NIST have implemented FISMA requirements. To do so,GAO reviewed information security reports from fiscal year 2018 issued by OMB and inspectors general for the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 agencies and 4 non-CFO Act agencies and interviewed officials from these agencies and OMB officials. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have ongoing and planned initiatives to support the implementation of the government-wide Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), which requires agencies to provide information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information or information systems. In addition, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is required to report annually to Congress on agencies' progress in implementing cybersecurity-related cross-agency priority goals. The CIO reporting metrics are organized around the five core security functions outlined in NIST's cybersecurity framework, which is intended to provide a high-level, strategic view of the life cycle of an organization's management of cybersecurity risk. The National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) programs are to provide federal departments and agencies with commercial off-the-shelf capabilities and tools that identify cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, prioritize these risks based upon potential impacts, and enable cybersecurity personnel to mitigate the most significant problems first. Information security reports issued by GAO, inspectors general, and CIOs indicate that the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the 16 selected agencies GAO reviewed are ineffective. Specifically, these agencies did not consistently or effectively implement policies or practices related to the core security function of the cybersecurity framework. For example, most of the selected agencies had deficiencies in implementing the eight elements of an agency-wide information security program, as defined by FISma. Further, most agencies had not effectively implemented controls to detect and respond to cyber events and vulnerabilities, as required by the Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM). Further, agency inspectors general reported that the 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act generally did not have effective information security controls over financial systems during fiscal year (FY) 2018. In FY 2018, the 23 civilian CFO act agencies reported spending between $9 million and almost $1.9 billion on cybersecurity- or IT security-related activities. For these 23 agencies, total reported security spending accounted for about 14 percent of their IT spending, with percentages for individual agencies ranging from 5 percent to 208 percent, as seen in the figure below. The three agencies with the highest reported spending on cybersecurity were the Departments of Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, State, and the Treasury; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Federal Communications Commission; Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board; Merit Systems Protection Board; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Presidio Trust; the Small Business Administration; and the Social Security Administration. The Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Agency for International Development also reported deficiencies in their cybersecurity programs. OMB has taken a number of actions intended to improve federal information security, such as issuing guidance and monitoring agencies' implementation of information security requirements. However, the number of agencies scheduled to participate in OMB's CyberStat meetings has significantly declined over the last 3 years. These meetings are intended to help ensure effective implementation of security policies. As of May 2019, OMB had not scheduled any agencies to participation in a CyberStat meeting during FY 2019. In May 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13800, which sets policy for managing cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise and directs each executive branch agency to use the NIST cybersecurity framework to manage those risks.
Medication synchronization is a process whereby a pharmacist aligns the refill dates of two or more of a patient's medications to a single day each month—referred to as the synchronization date. Patients who are interested in medication synchronization must enroll or opt into the service, if offered at their pharmacy. To initiate medication synchronization, the pharmacist selects an anchor medication to which the other medications are synchronized, and dispenses short fills—that is, a quantity of less than a month's supply—so that the patient has enough medication until the next synchronization date and avoids disruptions in his or her medication regimen. GAO was asked to review the use of medication synchronization. This report examines: (1) the extent to which pharmacies and patients are using medication synchronization; (2) the potential benefits and limitations associated with medication synchronization for patients, pharmacies, and health plans; and (3) whether laws in selected states support medication synchronization and stakeholders' views on its potential benefits. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed peer-reviewed studies, interviewed officials from five selected pharmacies and five selected health plans that offer prescription drug coverage (Part D), and reviewed laws in five selected states. The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. Limited information available indicates that the Use of Medication Synchronization has increased in recent years, but comprehensive data on its use do not exist. For example, one study found that the number of retail pharmacies using this service increased from 3,324 in 2013 to 5,534 in 2014, a 66 percent increase. In addition, the study also found that patients using the service at these retail pharmacies increased from 124,608 to 438,100 in 2014. Officials from all five pharmacies that GAO interviewed said that their pharmacies have increased their use of this service, but they generally could not provide GAO with data on their patients' use of the service over time. Stakeholders representing patients and pharmacies told GAO that they view medication synchronization as having the potential to improve patients' medication adherence and health outcomes, but two of these stakeholders noted the lack of data explicitly tying medication synchronization to improved patient medication adherence, medical outcomes, and overall medical costs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) does not have a formal medication synchronization program or policy for Medicare; however, a CMS regulation related to prescription drug benefits may support medication synchronization by reducing beneficiary cost sharing for certain amounts dispensed, according to officials. Specifically, CMS issued a regulation in 2014 that required Medicare Part D plans to establish a daily cost-sharing rate (for example, a prorated copayment) when a beneficiary receives a short fill of a prescription medication. Because short fills may be needed to initially synchronize multiple medications to the same refill date, theProrated Copayment Policy may reduce the financial burden on beneficiaries who require these fills, and may also reduce the time and resources that pharmacies otherwise would have expended on addressing issues with these drug claims. The five states—Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Texas, Washington, and Washington—enacted laws within the last 4 years that may support medications synchronization, such as requiring health plans in their state to provide coverage for medication short fills and allowing pharmacies to work around certain plan policies that may impose limits on medication refills. While stakeholders generally said that these laws have helped to support medication synchronized, they also said that the absence of such laws has not prevented pharmacies from using it in other states. For instance, three pharmacy chains reported that they offered these services in at least some states without such laws.
Surface Warfare Officers play a critical role in Navy surface fleet readiness, as they are responsible for safely driving ships at sea and successfully leading ships in Navy operations across the world. In 2017, four Navy surface ships collided at sea, resulting in the death of 17 sailors and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to Navy ships. GAO was asked to review SWO ship-driving training. This report (1) describes the changes the Navy has made or planned to SWO training since the 2017 collisions and (2) assesses the extent to which the Navy is taking actions to evaluate the effectiveness of those changes. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed Navy documentation and interviewed Navy officials on the content, purpose, cost, and status of changes made and further changes planned to training. The Navy has enhanced training for Surface Warfare Officers (SWO)—Navy officers whose training and primary duties focus on the operation of Navy ships and the management of various shipboard systems—at the early stages of their careers and by 2021 plans to triple the number of training hours SWOs are required to complete when compared with the amount they were required to receive prior to the 2017 ship collisions. For example, the Navy added a 4-week Junior Officer of the Deck course in June 2019 that focused exclusively on building ship- driving skills. This course will add 158 hours of required classroom and simulator training and will be followed by an additional 535 hours of training in June 2021—triple (a threefold increase in) the amount of training SWOs were required for their first and second at-sea assignments prior to 2017. In addition, in January 2023, two new simulator-based training facilities—the Mariner Skills Training Centers—are planned to be completed in San Diego, California and Norfolk, Virginia. These facilities—including upgraded simulators, the instructors, classrooms, and curriculum development—will cost approximately $467.5 million through fiscal year 2025. Navy officials report that these changes are intended to enhance the development and sustainment of SWO proficiency across a SWO's career and to ensure that the changes in training are resulting in competent SWOs at each level of their career—essentially that SWOs have the skills required to perform their duties. Senior Navy officials stated that it could take 16 years or more to know if the planned changes to SWOs training were effective in increasing Commanding Officer ship- Driving proficiency across the fleet. These officials stated they intend to closely monitor the implementation of changes to the training; however, we found a number of interrelated challenges that limit the Navy's ability to determine in the near term if the significant investments it is making to expand and enhance SWOs' ship driving training are effective. Specifically, in planning an approach for evaluating its efforts, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps have established key processes and assessments to evaluate training and development efforts, such as obtaining feedback, assessing competency, and analyzing relevant data. However, while the Navy collects feedback from certain groups of SWOs, it does not have a formal fleet-wide process to solicit feedback from SWOs on the quality of the increased amount of ship-Driving training or to gauge the health of the SWO community. In group discussions GAO held as part of its review, SWOs identified challenges that Division Officers experience in applying classroom and Simulator training to their duties, due to factors such as differences between training curriculum and actual duties, extended lengths of time elapsed between training and application, varying training opportunities during Division Officer assignments, and difficulty retaining the large volume of course material. SWOs that participated in GAO's discussion groups and interviews identified positive aspects of the training, as well as concerns about training material. For instance, during five of 12 ship group discussions with Division Officers, those Division Officers that had taken the Basic Division Officer Course identifiedpositive aspects of training such as valuable practical exercises and simulator time. More experienced Division Officers in four of 12 group discussions identified challenges related to the Advanced Division Officer course, including areas where they had to compensate with on-the-job training for skills they felt should have been addressed in initial training. Without a method to regularly collect and analyze SWO feedback on the effect of increased classroom, simulator, and at- sea training on Division Officer performance, and evaluate trends in feedback received, Navy decision makers lack valuable information that could help them to assess the effects of training on SWO performance.
In 1986, the United States entered into a compact of free association with the FSM and the RMI that provided for economic assistance to the two countries, secured U.S. defense rights, and allowed citizens of both countries to migrate to theUnited States. In 2003, after a period of negotiations, Congress amended the compacts to provide for the establishment of compact trust funds in each country. These funds are to provide grants to the countries in six core sectors, including education, health, infrastructure, environment, private sector development, and public sector capacity building. In fiscal year 2016, Congress appropriated about $1.3 billion for these grants and related programs. The compact trust fund agreements with each country also provide for a variety of other programs and services, including disaster response, disaster preparedness and response, postal services, civil aviation, and telecommunications, among others. GAO was asked to provide information on the status of these programs. This testimony is based on GAO's May 2018 report ( GAO-18-415 ). It addresses (1) the extent to which the compact Trust Fund Agreements and related legislation provide for grants and programs and (2) the future of the compact funds and programs after fiscal year 2023. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed the compact's implementing legislation (Pub. L. No. 108-188) and compact-related agreements, interviewed relevant officials, and conducted a series of simulations of future trust fund disbursements. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) rely on a number of grants and other programs that end in 2023 to support a substantial portion of government expenditures in both countries. Compact sector grants and the supplemental education grant (SEG) supported about one-third of FSM national and state government expenditures and one-quarter of RMI government expenditures. The FSM states relied on these grants to a greater extent than did the national government. The SEG and additional grants identified in the amended compacts' implementing legislation are scheduled to end after 2023, but the statutory authorizations for some of these grants provide for their continued eligibility under current law. For example, the SEG replaced several programs, such as Head Start early education programs, that were formerly awarded to the FPMS and RMI under several U. S. education and health programs. In addition, the compact sector grants for Kwajalein-related grants to both countries will end at the end of fiscal year 2024, but grants for which the R MI is scheduled to continue under the terms of its military use and operating rights agreement (MUORA) will continue for as long as the agreement is in effect. The programs and service agreements with both countries also identify additional programs that are available to each country after the agreements end in 2024. While these agreements will end in the future, under current laws, some agencies may continue to provide some of the programs under other authorities. For instance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be able to provide disaster response funding after the agreement ends, while the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may continue providing deposit insurance. The countries' eligibility for other programs identified in other U.s. laws will also continue after fiscal years 2023 and 2024. The Compact Trust Funds GAO reviewed in May 2018 showed that after fiscalyear 2023 the F SM and R MI compact trust Funds are unlikely to provide maximum annual disbursement and may provide no disbursemen at all in some years. The risk of disburseions below the maximum and the risk of zero disbursal increases over time for both funds. Potential strategies GAO identified would reduce or eliminate this risk. However, all of the potential strategies would require the countries to exchange a near-term reduction in resources for more-predictable and more-sustainable disbursed funds in the longer term. In May 2018 GAO recommended that the Secretary of the Interior ensure that the Director of the Office of Insular Affairs work with other members of the trust fund committees to develop distribution policies, develop fiscal procedures, and address the timing of the calculation of the amounts available to disburse. The committees have continued to discuss potential actions to address these recommendations, but have not yet made any decisions. As of September 2019, Interior had not implemented any of the recommendations.
DOD privatized military housing for servicemembers and their families under the MHPI program, which allows the military departments to obtain private-sector financing and management to repair, renovate, construct, and operate military housing in the United States and its territories. GAO was asked to review issues related to privatized housing. This report examines the extent to which DOD (1) conducts oversight of privatized homes, (2) has communicated roles and responsibilities to residents, and (3) has developed and implemented initiatives to improve privatized home. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed OSD and military department policies and guidance and interviewed OSD, military department, and private partner officials at a non-generalizable sample of 10 installations selected to represent each military department and six private partners—including the five largest who own the majority of military housing. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and each of the individual military departments conduct a range of activities to oversee both the condition of privatize housing and the performance of the private partners, but the scope of these oversight efforts is limited. The military departments have taken steps to oversee the physical condition of their privatized inventory and each has issued guidance that outlines their respective oversight roles, but these efforts have been limited. For example, the Army and Air Force are required to inspect 100 percent of homes that have undergone change-of-occupancy maintenance. However, according to a May 2019 report by the Army Inspector General, these requirements were inconsistently met, and the results did not include a follow-up process and were not communicated to senior commanders. OSD has not provided clear oversight objectives for overseeing the condition and performance of private partners. The Department of Defense's (DOD) guidance for military-owned housing provides clearly defined objectives for oversight, such as ensuring that housing is in good condition and meets minimum standards for configuration, privacy, condition, health, and safety. In contrast, OSD's guidance for overseeing privatized projects is focused on the oversight of the implementation of projects, the construction of new housing units, and project financial monitoring. Without clearly defined oversight objectives, DOD cannot be assured that its oversight activities will be sustained over time or be sufficiently consistent across projects, raising the risk that private partners may not provide adequate quality housing. DOD is required to provide reports to Congress that include, among other things, information about military housing privatization projects' financial health and performance and the backlog, if any, of maintenance and repairs. These reports have also included information on resident satisfaction based on the results of the annual military department satisfaction surveys. In May 2019, DOD issued its report for fiscal year 2017, which stated that overall resident satisfaction for calendar year 2017 was 87 percent, but this number is misleading due to issues associated with the collection and calculation of the data DOD used. Specifically, the data used to calculate resident satisfaction were not consistent across military departments, and in the case of the Army, differed from year to year. Further, the presentation of data in the report to Congress is misleading because OSD did not explain the methodology it used or include caveats to explain limitations to the data. Until OSD makes efforts that make up the department's report and provides explanations of thedata in the reports, it will not be able to provide Congress with an accurate picture of resident satisfaction with privatized Housing. Military housing offices located at each installation are available to provide resources to servicememberbers experiencing challenges with their Privatized Housing, but they have not effectively communicated their role as a resource to residents. The Air Force Inspector General reported in April 2019 that less than half of the residents interviewed used their military housing office to resolve complaints, and at some installations officials visited many residents did not know the military housing offices had an oversight role. The Navy announced a standardized two-step resolution process in May 2019 for housing residents who have issues or concerns with their current homes. The first step is to report any issue to the local property manager. If the issue is not resolved in either a timely manner or to quality standards, residents are asked to contact their local Navy housing service center, which directly reports to the installation commanding officer, or the servicEMember's chain of command. The Marine Corps has established a three-step dispute resolution process for residents to follow when they are experiencing a dispute with the private partner.
The Department of Defense (DOD) obligates hundreds of billions of dollars each year on contracts, including those for work in high-risk industries such as construction and ship building and repairing, and some companies have received DOD contracts after being cited for serious workplace safety or health violations. GAO was asked to review DOD's oversight of contractor workplace safety and health. This report examines (1) the incidence of prior serious safety violations among selected companies with DOD manufacturing and construction contracts, and (2) how DOD and selected DOD components address contractor workplace health and safety during the acquisition process. To address these objectives, GAO selected a non-generalizable sample of DOD contracts awarded in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 and selected two military departments (Army and Navy) and two components within these departments (the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Naval Sea Systems Command). GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance, and interviewed officials from DOD, the Department of Labor's (DOL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and selected components within the Army and Navy. Of the 192 companies selected with the largest DOD construction and manufacturing contracts in fiscal year 2017 (as measured by federal obligations), GAO found that a little more than half (106 of 192) were inspected by OSHA or state agencies from fiscal years 2013 to 2017. Of these 106 companies, 83 were cited for a total of 405 serious workplace health or safety violations, including 195 for serious violations (when there was a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result and the employer knew, or could have known with the exercise of reasonable diligence, of the hazard). For some, but not all, of these serious violations, the related inspection data described accidents in which 7 workers died, 20 were hospitalized for severe injuries—including fractures, chemical burns, other burns, and amputations—and 4 had severe injuries that did not require hospitalization. These companies were assessed financial penalties totaling about $1.2 million over that time period, including about $742,000 in penalties for severe violations. While GAO could identify some of the selected companies that were previously cited for safety violations in 2017, the overall incidence of these violations among all inspected companies with Defense contracts is unknown because data limitations prevent comprehensive matching of federal contracting data with OSHA inspection data. Specifically, the corporate identification numbers used in the federal contracting databases—the Employer Identification Number/Taxpayer Identification Number (EIN/TIN) and the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number—are not well-populated in OSHA's database because OSHA has not designated them as required fields. OSHA officials are required to enter certain types of data in its inspection database—such as the employer's name and address, the type of inspection, and any violations that were identified during the inspection—and have the option to enter the employer’s EIN/ TIN and DUNS number. However, at the time of GAO's review, for manufacturing andConstruction inspections initiated from fiscal year 2013 to2017, the EIN-TIN of the inspected company was entered in OSH's inspection data for about one-third of all inspections, and the DUNs number was entered for about 8 percent of all Inspections (see fig.). OSHA acknowledged that it is difficult to match records across different databases without corporate identification Numbers. In addition, OSHA makes information about violations publicly available on its website, which can be searched by company name and industry code, among other fields. Without requiring a corporate identification number in the inspection database and enabling the website to be searched for that number, DOD contracting officials and other interested parties are likely to experience challenges obtaining accurate information about companies' workplace safety records. Officials at DOD have multiple opportunities to address contractor safety throughout the acquisitionprocess. For example, during the award phase, officials can consider safety information when they evaluate contractors' past performance for contracts awarded competitively using negotiated procedures. During the contract performance phase, the Army, Navy, and Navy take additional steps related to workplace safety, such as accident prevention and accident reporting. Only the Army has a practice of requiring contracting officials to assess contractor safety performance on construction contracts at the completion of the contract. As a consequence, safety performance information for other contracts across DOD may not be readily accessible to officials when awarding new contracts. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) does not specifically require DOD to consider information about
DOD has made progress toward its goals of building and maintaining a trained cyber mission force (CMF) by establishing and updating training standards, developing standard operating procedures for readiness reporting, and using existing training capabilities to build CMF teams. However, many of the teams that have been built are not yet fully trained and, according to agency officials, have “generally low” readiness levels. GAO was asked to review DOD's efforts to build and maintain a trained CMF. This report examines (1) the extent to which DOD has developed and maintained a trained and ready CMF, and (2) the steps DOD has taken to ensure that it is poised to maintain future CMF training following the transition to a joint training model. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed officials from DOD, the military services, and the National Security Agency. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken a number of actions to develop a trained Cyber Mission Force, but it has not taken key actions to ensure the department is poised for future training following this transition. As part of the department's efforts, the U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) and the services have established consistent training standards for the CMF and developed and implemented a series of foundational training courses. These standards apply to all military personnel regardless of service affiliation or active/reserve status. Further, the services and CYBERCOM have used existing capabilities, such as courses, instructors, and facilities, to build teams. For example, the Navy's Center for Information Warfare Training is the host for the Joint Cyber Analysis Course—a phase one basic training course for personnel designated for cryptologic roles. The Army's National Cryptologic School provides a majority of the other phase two foundational CMF courses. The military services plan to continue to use existing resources such as the service school houses for new and continuous training into the future. In addition, the Army is developing a Persistent Cyber Training Environment, which will provide on-demand access to scenarios that Army officials told GAO will enhance the quality, quantity, and standardization of future collective and sustainment training and exercise events. DOD has not developed plans that include time frames for validating all of the foundational courses, or that comprehensively assess the services' training requirements. As of June 2018, CYberCOM had not provided a plan for establishing independent assessors to evaluate and certify the completion of phase three collective training. Without such a plan, it is unclear whether the services will be well positioned to reasonably assure that phase three training will meet the needs of the Cyber Protection Team and its mission. The Navy's and Army's plans do not identify specific time frames or milestones indicating a time for completing course validation. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government highlights the need to define objectives in specific terms, to include how objectives are to be achieved and timeframes for their achievement. Without a documented plan to train and certify assessors from across the services to evaluate CMF phase three certification events, the teams will not be consistently evaluated as they are operationally certified. The services also do not have a plan to assess and certify CMF team evaluators to a set of standardized criteria, which could lead to a more consistent application of evaluation criteria. In the absence of a plan that identifies the number of personnel or teams needed to accomplish specific training activities, DOD cannot reasonably ensure that its training plan will support the transition or be aligned with its stated goal to maintain atrained and ready force.
VA's mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans by ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials. In providing health care and other benefits to veterans and their dependents, VA relies extensively on IT systems and networks to receive, process, and maintain sensitive data, including veterans' medical records and other personally identifiable information. Accordingly, effective information security controls based on federal guidance and requirements are essential to ensure that the department's systems and information are adequately protected from loss, unauthorized disclosure, inadvertent or deliberate misuse, or improper modification, and are available when needed. GAO was asked to provide a statement on the status of VA's efforts to modernize and secure its information and information systems. This statement addresses (1) the extent to which federal agencies have implemented effective security controls over their information systems and (2) key security challenges that VA faces as it modernizes and secures its systems. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on its previously published work in this area. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to be challenged in implementing an effective agency-wide program and controls for securing its information systems, and has not yet fully addressed some of the key information security challenges GAO has reported on since fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2018, VA's Inspector General (IG) determined that the agency's information security program was not effectively implemented. For example, the IG reported that VA did not have an effective security program for its financial systems and had deficient security controls. As a result of these deficiencies, the IGs at 18 of the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies designated information security as either a material weakness (6 agencies, including VA) or significant deficiency (12 agencies) in internal control over financial reporting for their agency. For VA, fiscal year2018 was the 17th year in a row that VA had reported a material security weakness in information security. In addition, 21 of 24 CFO Act agencies reported that information security was a major management challenge for their agencies for fiscal years 2018 and 2017. These deficiencies existed, in part, because the department had not effective implemented key elements of its information security programs. Until VA rectifies reported shortcomings in its security program, it will continue to have limited assurance that its sensitive information and systems are sufficiently safeguarded. VA has also been challenged in assuring that its actions to mitigate vulnerabilities and implement recommended improvements are effective. The department has asserted that it had implemented 39 of the 42 remaining open recommendations from GAO's fiscal year 2015 and 2016 reports. However, the evidence VA provided was insufficient to demonstrate that it has fully implemented the recommendations. VA subsequently provided additional evidence, which was also insufficient, indicating that its remedial action process was not validating the effectiveness of actions taken to resolve known deficiencies. As of October 2019, over 3 years later, VA had implemented only 32 (or 43 percent) of the 74 recommendations GAO made to improve its cybersecurity program and remedy known control deficiencies with selected high-impact systems. VA also has not consistently and comprehensively performed security control assessments, an important element of a cybersecurity program that helps to provide assurance that controls are operating as intended and to detect controls that are not functioning correctly. As GAO reported in July 2019, VA has not fully met only one of the five foundational practices for establishing a cybersecurity risk management program. Although VA established the role of an executive-level cybersecurity risk executive, it had not fully developed a strategy that addressed key elements, such as risk tolerance and risk mitigation strategies, documented risk-based policies that required the department to perform risk assessments, or established coordination between cybersecurity and enterprise risk management. VA concurred with GAO recommendations to address these deficiencies and stated that it is acting to do so. Until the department fully establishes a cybersecurityrisk management program, its ability to convey acceptable limits regarding the selection and implementation of controls within the established organizational risk tolerance will be diminished. VA's workforce positions performing information technology, cybersecurity, and cyber-related functions are likely to be miscategorized in its personnel system, hindering VA's ability to identify critical staffing needs.
DOD has fielded or plans to field PACS that connect to IMESA at all domestic installations, but only the Air Force and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) have monitored PACS use at their installations. The Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps at more than 100 installations have not monitored the use of PACS because, as stated by officials, there is not a requirement to do so. As a result, these components do not have the data necessary to evaluate PACS effectiveness and inform risk-based decisions to safeguard personnel and mission-critical, high-value installation assets. GAO was asked to review DOD's physical access controls at domestic installations. This report (1) describes actions DOD has taken to develop guidance on physical access to domestic installations and to field field physical access control systems (PACS) at these installations, (2) evaluates the extent to which DOD components have monitored their use of fielded PACS, and (3) evaluates DOD's approach for addressing PACS technical issues and assessing associated performance. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed DOD guidance, analyzed DOD component and installation-specific PACS data, and interviewed DOD officials. The Department of Defense (DOD) has recently issued department-wide guidance for controlling installation physical access, Fielded or Planned to Field Physical Access Control Systems at all Domestic Installations, and identified future enhancements to the Identify Matching Engine for Security and Analysis (IMESA) and the Automated Personnel Access Control System (AIE). DOD's Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I) issued a physical security manual in January 2019 that addresses minimum departmentwide standards for access to DOD installations. According to OUSD(I and DOD component officials, as of February 2019, each DOD component had fielded or planned to field electronic PACS at all of their domestic installations that connect with IMESA. The Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and DLA have fielded DBIDS, which is used to control access to their respective installations. DBIDS consists of hardware and software--specifically, computers, servers, badge printers, and handheld identification devices--that electronically connect to authoritative government databases using IMESA, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center's Wanted Persons file to determine if there are records on the individuals for an outstanding felony warrant; the Terrorist Screening Database to determine whether the individuals are known or suspected terrorists; and the local population database to identify if credentials issued by installations have been revoked or have expired. DMDC and the Army have approaches and helpdesk for resolving DBIDS technical issues, but DMDC has not assessed the performance of its approach, while the Army has developed performance measures and associated goals to assess AIE's performance. The DOD components' user agreements with the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) do not include performance measures or associated goals regarding DBIDS' operational availability and the timely resolution of technical issues. Without such measures and goals, DMDC is unable to systematically evaluate how well DBIDS is performing and address underlying issues negatively affecting DBIDS operational availability. The U.S. Northern Command's DMDC plans to enhance IMESA's capabilities to allow for increased information sharing and vetting, and to expand the type of credentials that DBIDS can scan. For example, according to DMDC officials, scheduled enhancements to DBIDS will enable security forces to scan cards and driver's licenses compliant with the REAL ID Act of 2005 by the end of fiscal year 2019, which will eliminate the time and expense to annually issue and print hundreds of thousands of temporary DBIDS credentials.
The F-35 Lightning II is DOD's most costly and ambitious aircraft acquisition, with a planned investment of more than $400 billion to develop and field more than 3,300 aircraft. ALIS is the primary logistics system used to manage the aircraft's operations, sustainment, and sustainment. GAO was asked to review issues with ALIS. This report addresses the extent to which (1) there have been improvements as well as key challenges over the last 5 years, (2) DOD has an effective procedure for addressing and mitigating specific risks and challenges that may be associated with a major weapon system, and (3) DOD is taking actions to enhance the long-term viability of ALIS and has a plan for future system re-design. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed officials from DOD, the prime contractor, and other key stakeholders at 5 of the 10 U.S. locations selected based on their ALIS oversight, planning, and/or execution roles. The Department of Defense (DOD) has made some improvements to its Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) since GAO last reported on it in April 2016, but users continue to report significant challenges with the system that are affecting day-to-day operations of the F- 35 aircraft. For example, according to users at all 5 locations GAO visited, ALIS's data processing, downloading of information, and screen navigation were generally faster than it was 5 years ago. However, users also stated that ALIS still poses significant challenges to day- to-day F-15 operations. For instance, users at 1 location said that ALis's slow applications require maintainers to work additional hours to complete required maintenance tasks. Additionally, users said that the training and mission planning applications within ALIS remain immature and that training to learn how to use ALIS does not provide adequate knowledge or information to fully prepare users to operate the system. DOD is unable to assess ALIS performance because it has not developed performance metrics and is unaware of how ALIS-related challenges are affecting F-25 fleet-wide readiness. DOD officials acknowledged that historically, DOD has prioritized other aspects of the program, such as the development of the airframe, over its logistics system. As a result, limited DOD attention on ALIS has resulted in a troubled history with it. As of September 2019, there were about 4,700 open ALIS deficiencies, which are used to track and manage ALIS issues. DOD and its prime contractor have established three initiatives to re- design and fix ALIS, but GAO found that DOD lacks clarity on how it will address key technical and programmatic uncertainties about the future of the system, including the extent that the re-designed ALIS will incorporate current ALIS software. Further, there are divergent views among officials involved with the various initiatives in terms of how DOD should approach the system's future design, highlighting the uncertainty that exists about how DOD will address the future design of ALis. Without a strategy to guide the ALIS re- redesign, DOD will not be able to effectively plan for the transition from the current system to a future one, which is already embedded in over 400 aircraft across the global fleet.
In September 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued the National Preparedness Goal: a secure and resilient nation with the capabilities required across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk. GAO was asked to review FEMA's efforts to strengthen the nation's preparedness for future disasters. This report examines (1) the extent to which FEMA has defined the capability gaps across all levels of government, (2) how jurisdictions have used preparedness grants to strengthen their emergency management capabilities, and (3) the steps FEMA has taken to assess the federal government's and jurisdictions' preparedness capabilities. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed preparedness data from 2013 through 2018, reviewed FEMA policies and procedures, and interviewed FEMA officials. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has taken numerous steps to continue to strengthen national preparedness, such as distributing grant funds. However, FEMA has not fully defined the national emergency management capability gaps and determined what steps are needed to address the gaps. For example, in 2018, FEMA issued new guidance requiring jurisdictions to use more quantitative data to assess their preparedness levels. In 2019, FEMA began working on its first National Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (National THIRA), which is intended to provide a quantitative assessment of federal capabilities, which, when combined with state, territory, urban area, and tribal THIRAs and SPRs, could provide a more meaningful assessment of the nation’s overall preparedness. FEMA has also taken steps to enhance its methodology for assessing jurisdictions’ preparedness by requiring them to collect more quantitative preparedness-related data to support their capability ratings. While these actions may allow FEMA to address GAO’S 2011 recommendation to complete an assessment of capability gaps at each level of government based on tiered, capability-specific performance objectives to enable prioritization of grant funding, the agency has yet to determine what additional actions may be needed to close the remaining gaps once the 2020 National Prep preparedness report is issued in 2020. In addition, while FEMA has encouraged jurisdictions to make investments in core capabilities that have the largest preparedness gaps (i.e., the lowest preparedness scores), such as cybersecurity, it does not require jurisdictions to spend grant funding in a certain area. As FEMA implements its new methodology and begins to more fully assess both federal and jurisdictional capabilities, it is expected to have better and more quantitative information on capability gaps in order to better prioritize grant funds and resources. Such information could help inform budget decisions across the preparedness enterprise and help prioritize limited resources. FEMA also has taken some steps to close capability gaps jurisdictions have identified since 2012, including proposing a National Priorities Security Grant, but this program has not been approved by Congress, and thus, will not help to address these gaps. According to FEMA officials, preparedness grant funding alone is unlikely to address gaps in an effective manner. In fiscal years 2013 to 2018, jurisdictions received approximately $8.3 billion in preparedness funds primarily from the State Homeland Security Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and the Emergency Management Performance Grant. Of this amount, jurisdictions directed about 87 percent to capabilities in the crosscutting, prevention, and response mission areas, which constitute the highest-rated mission areas. Of the remaining $1.1 billion, about 13 percent was directed to capabilities within the mitigation, protection, and recovery mission areas—mission areas that generally have lower preparedness ratings—and about 1 percent to the recovery mission area, which includes disaster housing and infrastructure. While FEMA is taking steps to encourage jurisdictions to enhance their lower-rated capabilities, FEMA officials told GAO their efforts will likely not be sufficient to fully address capability gaps.
DOE provides PILT payments to communities to replace tax revenue that communities are no longer receiving because of DOE's acquisition of property in their communities. Payments are based on the taxes communities would have received if the property had remained on the tax rolls in the condition in which it was acquired. In fiscal year 2017, communities at 12 DOE sites received or had pending payments totaling over $23 million. GAO was asked to review DOE's processes for making and receiving payments. This report assesses (1) how, if at all, PILt payments vary across sites and how they have varied over time, and (2) reasons for variations in payments and the extent to which DOE is providing assurance that payments meet goals. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed DOE data and documents, interviewed DOE officials, and interviewed officials from selected communities that received some of the largest payments. The Department of Energy's (DOE) payments for post-acquisition intangible income tax (PILT) vary considerably across sites, with the two sites with the most eligible land receiving the majority of payments—the Hanford site in Washington State and the Savannah River site in South Carolina. The majority of communities at DOE's 74 sites are ineligible to receive payments under the Atomic Energy Act because they are on property that either was not on local tax rolls prior to acquisition, is private land, is land controlled by another federal agency, or is university-owned, according to DOE. In addition, some sites include a mix of eligible and ineligible acreage. For example, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico is on federal land and thus not subject to prior state or local taxation, while Sandia Lab, Kauai, Hawaii, is on private land. Variations in payments across sites are largely due to differences among the sites, including the different histories and market conditions at each site, but DOE is not providing adequate assurance that it is providing payments that fully reflect the terms of their original agreements and consistently meet the goals of the act. The order implementing the act allows for variation in payments based on property characteristics, market conditions, and tax policies, but does not require communities to document key determinants of payments in their annual invoices to DOE or for DOE to document these determinants in its intergovernmental agreements with communities. As a result, DOE does not have sufficient assurance that its payments are consistent with the agreed upon bases of payments, and DOE is more likely to make payments that do not meet its goals. In some cases, payments appear to be higher than the amount communities might have received had the property remained on their tax rolls had it been on the rolls in its original condition. In one case, a county at Hanford—Benton County, Washington—provided DOE with a 2019 payment invoice that was about $5 million lower than the previous year. According to the county officials GAO spoke with, the goal of providing a lower payment invoice was to increase the likelihood that they would receive the full amount. However, DOE's order does not include any information about under what conditions DOE will adjust payments—such as if payments calculations are not consistent with payment determinants—to guide DOE's oversight. In other cases, it is unclear whether payments are clearly linked to the revenue communities would be expected to receive had the properties remained on tax rolls as they were when they were acquired. DOE's lack of specificity on these topics has resulted in a relatively hands-off approach to management and oversight as well as some uncertainty about how to determine payments.
State's Civil Service and Foreign Service are the two largest components of the U.S. government workforce composed of racial or ethnic minorities and women, respectively. In fiscal year 2018, State had 22,806 full-time, permanent, career employees—an increase of more than 38 percent from fiscal year 2002. The proportion of racial and ethnic minorities at State increased from 28 percent in 2002 to 32 percent in 2018, while the proportion of women at State decreased from 44 percent to 43 percent. State has implemented several plans, activities, and initiatives to improve diversity and representation throughout the ranks of its workforce, but longstanding diversity issues—for example, underrepresentation in the senior ranks—persist at the agency. This testimony is based on GAO's descriptive and adjusted analyses of State data for fiscal years 2002 through 2018. It addresses (1) the extent to which State has identified some diversity issues in its reports to the EEOC, (2) the overall proportion of minorities at state, and (3) how promotion outcomes have changed for minorities in State's Civil and Foreign Services since 2002. To do this work, GAO analyzed State data and interviewed State officials. The Department of State (State) has identified and analyzed a total of 11 diversity issues related to participation in its Civil Service in fiscal years 2009 through 2018, but should consider other issues that could indicate potential barriers to equal opportunity in its workforce. State identified most of these issues in multiple years. For example, State's report to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on diversity in the Civil Service found that racial orethnic minorities were less likely than whites to be promoted from the GS-11 through GS-13 levels. GAO found that promotion rates were generally lower for minorities than for whites, but the differences in promotion odds were generally not statistically significant. For fiscal years 2018 and 2002-2018, State reported that it had a higher rate of promotion for women in the Foreign Service than for men. However, the odds of promotion from Class 4 to Class 3 were statistically significantly lower for women than for males in these positions, and the chances of promotion were generally higher for women from Class 3 to Class 2 and from Class 2 to Class 1 than for male and female employees in the Class 4 and higher ranks of both the Civil and the Foreign Services in fiscal year2018. State also reported that promotion outcomes for racial or Ethnic Minorities in the civil service were generally less than for white employees in both fiscal years 2010 and 2002, but these outcomes were not statistically significantly different from those for whites in those years. State employee groups and GAO analysis have identified additional diversity issues, such as differences in promoted outcomes for minorities relative to whites in early to mid career. For instance, employee group representatives expressed concern about representation of minorities in the higher ranks in both the civil and foreign services. For some minority groups, it is difficult to be promotions above the GS level. For women and racial or ethnicity minorities, it takes longer for them to reach higher levels of promotion. State could be missing opportunities to investigate and remove barriers that impede members of some demographic groups from realizing their full potential.
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) educated more than 226,000 African-American students in 2017 and have played a critical role in supporting underserved students and communities. SBA's 2018 plan for the White House Initiative on HBCUs calls for SBA to engage with HBCU and provide them with information needed to access and compete for federal grants and contracts. GAO was asked to review SBAs efforts to support HBCUS. This report examines, as did two related products, (1) SBA efforts to foster entrepreneurship through key programs and activities in recent years, (2) agency plans for the initiative, and (3) the extent to which SBA collected and recorded information specific to HBCUCs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed SBA documents and interviewed SBA officials and representatives from SBA district offices and SBDCs, among others. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has used Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) and co-sponsored activities to foster Entrepreneurial Development (business counseling and training) with historically black colleges and universities (HTCU) in recent decades. SBCUs have been the only host institutions for two of these programs for more than 30 years (and have remained so as of September 2019). SBA has also engaged with HTCU students, alumni, or faculty through strategic alliance memorandums, co-sponsorship agreements, and other activities. For example, from 2013 through 2018, SBA signed at least 35 strategic alliance Memorandums with HHCUs and at least 51 co- sponsorship agreements with institutions of higher education in states with HACUs in that period. In addition, from fiscal years 2008 through 2018 SBA provided GAO with a list of HBCUn-hosted SBDC service centers, which provide counseling, training, or other services to HACU students and alumni. In fiscal year 2018, in accordance with Executive Order 13779 (2017), SBA developed a plan (or update) for its 2018 plan to support the initiative. The 2018 plan included two primary goals: to raise awareness and provide information to increase the capacity of HTCUs to participate in federally funded programs and to promote collaboration among HBCus and SBA resource partners. The plan also included five measures to monitor SBA’s efforts, including the number of outreach events, number of attendees, and number of partnerships established. However, the plan was not communicated to district offices, which deliver most SBA programs and services, and to SBDC and district offices. Federal internal control standards state that management should internally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entityS objectives. SSA officials told GAO that the agency did not communicate its plan for supporting HBCMs to district office officials due to the timing of the planit was not finalized until near the end of the fiscal year. As a result, officials chose to focus on the upcoming fiscal year and future plans to supportHBCUs, rather than communicate the 2018 plan. Additionally, officials stated the Office of Field Operations was not involved in addressing the initiative in 2018, although the office is responsible for providing policy guidance and oversight to districts in implementing agency goals and objectives. Because SBA headquarters did not communicated its plan to district officials, they were not aware of the goal to collaborate with H BCUs, and therefore may have missed opportunities to collaborate and work toward 2018 plan goals, even if for a brief period. As of September 2018, it was unclear when SBA would communicate its fiscal year 2019 plan. If the 2019 and subsequent plans are not communicated, it could result in a scenario in which district offices are unaware of goals and may miss opportunities to engage and collaborate. The extent of data collection for its HBCu-related efforts is limited. For instance, while SBA is required to collect and report information on its outreach activities, such as number of events and attendees, it does not collect information on whether the events were hosted or participated in by an institution (such as an HBCC) or whether participants were affiliated with the institution (students, faculty, or alumni). As such, the information reported to headquarters would not be readily identifiable as HBC U-related. Also, while representatives of all eight district offices GAO contacted said they have conducted outreach activities with HMCUs, these activities would not have been readily identifiable in the data reported
DOD's 21 depots are critical for repairing and maintaining its complex array of weapon systems. Inefficient depots contribute to longer maintenance times, increased costs, and reduced readiness. A majority of the depots have facilities that are in poor condition and are relying on old equipment that is past its useful life. The military services spend millions of dollars annually on depot facilities and equipment in order to meet minimum investment requirements designed to sustain depot performance. Notwithstanding these expenditures, the services are not consistently required to track maintenance delays caused by facility or equipment conditions. This lack of tracking hinders the services' ability to target investments to facility and equipment needs that would have the greatest effect on repair times or other performance goals. By knowing how often these conditions lead to work delays, the military services could reduce the risk of investing in less critical depots and reduce the risks of more work stoppages caused by these conditions. GAO was asked to review DOD's management of its depots. This report examines the extent to which DOD and the services have (1) developed an approach for guiding depot investments to address key challenges and (2) tracked maintenance delays due to facility conditions. To do this work, GAO analyzed data from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, the latest year for which most data were available, reviewed service documentation, and interviewed DOD and service officials. The Department of Defense's (DOD) approach for guided depot investments lacks key elements important to addressing depot challenges efficiently and effectively. DOD is developing depot optimization plans, as directed by Congress, but these plans lack certain key elements that could enhance the effectiveness of service depot investments. For example, the plans lack analytically-based goals, results-oriented metrics, and a full accounting of the resources, risks, and stakeholders. Without these key elements, DOD risks continued deterioration of depots, suboptimal investments, and decreased military readiness as the services experience costly maintenance delays. Furthermore, there is currently no process at the Office of the Secretary of Defense level that monitors depot investment decisions or provides regular reporting to decision makers and Congress. Without regular monitoring and reporting on depot investment progress, DOD will not be in a position to ensure that it has the information needed to make critical funding and policy decisions to reverse years of decline and reach the challenging goals set by the Secretary for improving mission capability rates and reducing operating and support costs. The majority of DOD's 21 military depots rely on aging facilities, and the age of equipment generally exceeds its expected useful life, but the services do not consistently track how these conditions affect depot performance, as GAO's previous work has shown. GAOs' analysis of service metrics shows that depot facilities are, on average, rated as “poor” on DOD's facility rating scale, and that the average age and condition of equipment at depots has generally declined since fiscal year 2007. The service depots also have generally experienced worsening performance in terms of completing maintenance on time or in the required amount over the past decade, as shown in the figure below. The Navy aviation depots in particular have seen decreases in their timely completion of maintenance for aircraft, engines and modules, and components. The Army depot data is mixed—our analysis shows that the performance at two depots decreased, but for others it has held steady or improved. The Marine Corps depot output decreased by less than 1 percent between fiscal years 2012 and 2017, while the Army depot output increased. The services have used various facility strategies, such as restoring and modernizing facilities when funding was available, developing workarounds when space or funding was not available, or continuing to use the inadequate facilities. Over time, this patchwork of old, modernized, and workaround solutions for new weapons systems can result in suboptimzed workflow that adds time and cost to the maintenance process, which can ultimately affect readiness.
According to HRSA, the current demand for physicians in the United States will likely continue, with a projected shortage of 23,640 primary care physicians by 2025. While increasing physician supply is one way to reduce physician shortages, some experts have also suggested increasing the number of non-physician providers. For example, HRSA predicted that, with health care delivery changes that would allow for non-primary care providers (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) to deliver a greater proportion of services than they do now, the projected shortage in 2025 could be mitigated. GAO was asked to review issues related to graduate training for physicians, NPs, and PAs. This report examines (1) the education and training paths for physicians and (2) the potential benefits and challenges of expanding the Medicare Graduate Nurse Education (GME) program to include NP and PA graduate training. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed relevant literature; and interviewed officials from nine stakeholder organizations, including representatives from CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. The nine professional associations that GAO interviewed provided technical input, which was incorporated into the report as appropriate, as well as information from CMS on its evaluation of its graduate clinical training demonstration for advanced practice registered nurses—a category that includes NPs—and physician assistant (PA) graduate training, which is intended to determine whether payments for clinical training provided to hospitals would increase the number and type of advanced practice nurses, including NPs. Stakeholder organizations GAO contacted identified both potential benefits of and challenges to expanding Medicare GME to include graduate training of NPs and P as. Benefits of Expanding the Medicare General Medical Education Program to Include Graduate Training Stakeholders GAO spoke with identified potential benefits to expanding the GME program, such as creating more predictability and stability of funding for training for NPs or PAs by allowing programs to do better long-range planning such as planning for the number that can be admitted. Challenges to Expanding The Medicare Medical Graduate Education Program Officials from six of the nine stakeholders--two NP, two PA, and two physician organizations--raised concerns about challenges that could occur because of differences in training requirements between physicians, including the lack of a requirement to complete a residency after completing a graduate program in order to practice medicine independently in the U.S. The vast majority of federal funding for physician GME training is distributed by HHS through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through its Medicare Generalized Graduate Medical Education program, which makes payments to hospitals based on formula-based formula payments to cover a hospital's costs associated with training residents. However, officials from seven of nine stakeholders said that any change to the MedicareGME program would need to consider how to allocate GME funding for NP or PA training programs in light of these differences. Officials from 7 of the 9 stakeholders also expressed concern that expanding the program to increase the amount of funding available for physician training may negatively impact the overall amount of funds available for such training. The available estimates of the costs of graduate clinical NP and physician assistant training are limited and incomplete. CMS's evaluation estimated the total cost of clinical clinical NP training to be about $47,000 per student, based on the funds paid to demonstration sites from fiscal years 2012 through 2018, and the Physician Assistant Education Association estimated the cost of graduate PA training at about $45,300 per student. While these two estimates provide some information about training costs, they are not generalizable because they are based on information from the schools that participated in the demonstration. In addition, these data likely underreport the total costs of PA training because they exclude in-kind contributions from clinical sites, which are necessary to support clinical training. Officials estimated that paying for costs supported by these contributions would likely add an additional 25 percent to the total estimated cost to train PAs and NPs in fiscal year 2019.
